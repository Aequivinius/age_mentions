Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S .

In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories .

However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis .

A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Screening all donated blood for Zika virus is not cost-effective in the United States . Abstract : http://annals . org / aim / article / doi / 10 . 7326 / M18 - 2238 . Editorial : http://annals . 7326 / M18 - 3527 . URLs go live when the embargo lifts . Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year . Widespread screening would only be cost-effective in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico and never in the 50 states . Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted . However , the authors note that many other considerations should inform blood safety policies in addition to cost-effectiveness .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

{"id":2684649296,"data":{"text_raw":"August 27 , 2018 by Mary 1991 4 Comments . For most of Jessie's years , we didn't know any Angel parents . We were on our own to reinvent the wheel , navigating seizures , and sleep disturbances . Even though we heard a few words and phrases , upon learning of her Angleman diagnosis ( when she was 13 ) , I let go of the hope that Jess would talk in a traditional way . I wish I had someone that I could have shared with that understood . Earlier this week , I met with the only local Angel mom I know . We met by chance at a dance . Ashley was a chaperone . As soon as she saw Jessie , she suspected she was an Angel because she has one too . She made it her mission to meet the rest of the family before Jess left that night . Even though our children are different ages and stages , this hasn't prevented us from appreciating each other's perspective . Unfortunately , we don't get to visit that often , but when we do , we talk about anything and everything and of course , all things Angel . We all don't have the luxury of being with an Angelman mom / dad but we all can find a cyber one . I don't know if this will work but with two other Angel parents , we have just started a new Facebook group , Angelman Syndrome-Find a Buddy . ( for lack of better name ) . This is not another chat group . The sole purpose is to find another parent to connect to on a more personal level so we can reduce that feeling of being isolated . Every day , I read a parent announce they just were given a diagnosis . Others feel isolated because their needs are different from families who have typical children . Even when we were part of playgroups , I ended up being with Jess while the other mom's got to talk because Jess needed my support . Eventually , the divide grows wider as their children meet milestones at a much faster rate . For other parents with older children , their friends become empty nesters . Going out as couples became awkward because they don't want your third wheel . Believe me , I understand wanting a child-free zone and the luxury of being with just adults , however , we rarely get to do that . My new motto is , “ If you are an Angelman parent and don't know another Angelman parent , then get one ” ! Why specifically an Angelman parent ? Because firsthand experience means you don't have to explain yourself . Sharing common interests is integral to any friendship and this opportunity could be the beginning of beautiful friendships ! Some of you may already have your Angel-supports in place but maybe you could be a mentor to a young family ? Maybe you or someone you know was recently diagnosed and want to invite them to this group ? Or maybe you want to be part of the “ 3 am ” club because your kid has you up all night . This venue would allow you to find others “ awake ” at the same time . There might be a better forum to use than FB in that it could be set up in a more efficient way , however , this is what we have to work with . To begin , Join , Angelman Syndrome-Find a Buddy . Then add a brief post about yourself and what kind of support you would like to find . Maybe you are searching for one parent or maybe you want to form a group ( of three or four ) , or maybe you want to find someone where you check in once a week to see how they are doing ? ( You might find that you are FB friends already so this would be an opportunity to get to know them better ) . These are just suggestions . It's up to you to decide how to proceed . I don't know if this will work but I do know that Angelman parents are a very loving and supportive community . I've been blessed to make connections with families from around the world . Having friends in multiple time zones has been awesome ! This week , we will be tagging our friends to join this group . I'm afraid we may duplicate requests , if we do , please don't be annoyed . Since this is the launch , there should be a period of time for this group to build before connecting . I'd like to suggest that Buddy finding begins on September 15 , 2018 . Either this will be a flash of brilliance or an epic fail . Even if only a few connections are made , I'll consider this a success , however , it could be so much more . This will only work if you are willing to play . I hope you do !

{"id":2684649303,"data":{"text_raw":"I'll begin by saying MS sucks more than anything and there's nothing pleasant about it . My heart goes out to anyone who's been diagnosed with this chronic condition . Maybe its a bout of extreme euphoria today , or maybe its because today is Friday ; but I felt compelled to write my list of things I'm grateful for as a now 24 y . o . who was diagnosed with MS at 15 . \\ - * * Being diagnosed young allowed me to seek out the right help regarding my education and occupations . * * Many people who are diagnosed later on may have had to struggle with not knowing what was wrong with them and having their work or education suffer as a result . While this may be true in any scenario , being diagnosed early allowed me to ask for the help when I needed . This set a precedent and taught me how accommodations can be a good thing . \\ - * * Enabled me to be an active participant in MS and genetic research . * * Probably the point I'm most excited about ! MS and other autoimmune conditions have plagued me of course but also my mom and a good chunk of her family . We are beginning to scratch the surface in learning what triggers MS and how it is linked to genetics . I'm super excited to be able to help with this by educating myself and as an active participant . The more we know means we will be able to educate others on how to make the best decisions for themselves and those around them . \\ - * * Learning that I'm not invisible and that I shouldn't hesitate on doing things . * * I was constantly seeing people my age get told they're \" not invisible and they shouldn't act like they are . \" Well , the opposite has always been true for me and I'm now beginning to be grateful for it . I knew early on that I wasn't invisible and the unpredictability that comes with MS has pushed me to do the things that I would've hesitated on otherwise . Taking road trips with my friends and pursuing my education and work ethics are some examples of things that I wouldn't have pursued without my MS . \\ - * * Getting diagnosed at a time where MS medication options are plenty . * * These may allow me to retain a semblance of normality for as long as possible . So far I consider myself relatively lucky in regards to my illness even though it drives me buggy at times . I know that many medication options exist and unlike many of my relatives ; I actually have options that enable me to be more aggressive in treating my MS and I'm grateful to have the options . Hopefully this will allow me to maintain some sense of normality for as long as possible . Certainly better odds than in the past . \\ - * * Most importantly , I know who my real friends are and got to learn it quicker than most . * * A disease that's chronic and ravages the body like MS does means that you'll figure out who you can depend on really quick when things go bad . Being diagnosed early on means I was also fortunate enough not to be married or have kids that might be adversely impacted by such a diagnosis . Instead , when / if I choose those things I can make informed decisions regarding that kind of stuff . I cannot imagine what it would be like to have a partner leave me or to have children negatively impacted by such a chronic illness ( nor the strength it probably takes to cope with such things ) .

{"id":2684649317,"data":{"text_raw":"Hello . First of all , thank you for taking time to read this . I realize you are probably not a MD . I have seen MDs for the below described issues and would like to ask \\ * non \\ * - medical professionals with real-world experience . 35m here . tldr is below but a full read may help in offering the best insight . In August 2018 I had my tonsils removed . One month after this my soft palate descended in my mouth which gave me sleep-onset hypnic jerks . It was a terrible experience . My doctor prescribed . 5mg Etizolam three times daily ( I live in Japan where it is legal ) to help me get sleep . I wanted to be careful with the benzo-derivative so I only took one pill daily 30 min before going to bed . Etizolam helped a great deal and although I was careful with it , it was not mentally taxing or worrisome for me . Mid-November I noticed a tremor in my right pinky when my hand was held out and also a tremor in my left ring and pinky finger . I tapered the Etizolam and the tremor persisted and spread through my body ( lips , tongue , toes ) . As I was undergoing anxiety I am willing to attribute those tremors to simply that , stress / anxiety . I visited a neurologist who gave me an MRI immediately . No visible problems were evident . He asked me to wait two weeks and see . I waited two weeks and saw him again at which point the tremors had left my body but remained in my hands ( although to a lesser degree ) while also extending to my wrists and elbows . He said since the other tremors had gone I should wait and see if this was simply a withdrawal of Etizolam and he asked to see me in March 2019 . This was mid-December . On December 21st I began to have UTI-like symptoms . They were simple at first , a sensation of needing to visit the restroom ever-so-slightly more than usual . I saw a urologist that day and he said my urinalysis was clean . Dec . 23rd the slight urge persisted so I saw another GP , same result . Dec 26th visiting family in the States I was now having serious urges to void as soon as 10 minutes after voiding so I saw a urologist . Dx'd prostatitis and gave me a week of antibiotics . I felt better for a day then proceeded to get much , much worse . Dec 29th on what was supposed to be a surprise family trip to Disney World I had to be taken off the plane in Orlando and taken to a hospital I was in such pain and voiding so frequently . They CT'd and found no severe problems . Possible cystitis and suggested I get a cystoscopy . Dec 30th I woke up feeling okay but by 10AM I was attached by the hip to a toilet and experiencing pain in my urethra . That night I experienced mind-numbing frequency , urgency and pain . I could not think about anything other than voiding for hours on hours . Dec 31st , after a voiding around 10AM the symptoms slowly vanished . I'll leave out details of how I thought I was fine and came down with norovirus two days later putting a cap on the nightmare ' vacation ' . During this time my tremors in my fingers ( mostly dominant right hand ) seemed to settle as did tremors in my right wrist . There were now periods of the days where I could hold out my hand and pivot my wrists up and down without noticing a tremor throughout my hand . Slight tremors in my arms ( from elbow to fingertips ) persisted when I held my arms above my head or rest my elbows on a table and grasp my hands in front of me . January 11th , I noticed increasing trips to the bathroom . January 12th . From 2am - 9am I voided 9 times . Went back to local urologist in Japan , did an ultrasound and despite everything looking ' the right size ' he said could indeed be prostatitis and gave me the Japanese equivalent of Cialis . Symptoms began to taper that evening and through the next day . January 14th I felt completely like my old self . From around January 14th I was also able to hold my fingers straight and sometimes if I hold my fingers out but don't concentrate or try to force them straight , they easily stay straight . Just the same I visited a specialist for Interstitial Cystitis and he scheduled me for a cystoscopy . January 17th the urgency came back the morning of the cystoscopy . The cystoscopy looked great I have a healthy-looking bladder . tldr : Late November : Slight tremors in fingers and body . Eventually settling in fingers , wrists and arms at elbows . December : Reduction in tremor throughout body but remaining in fingers , hands , arms . Increasing urgency over ten-day period resulting in , ultimately , severe pain / burning and \\ * \\ * \\ * constant \\ * \\ * \\ * urge to void that vanished over 12hr window . January : Return of urinary urge symptoms but the length of symptoms is greatly reduced while on Cialis equivalent ( possible reaction to diet that is kind to bladder ) Periods of reduced tremor activity in fingers throughout the day are observed . Improvement in wrist tremor ( even during high stress periods ) Arm / elbow tremors persist . I have been through a plethora of Dr . Google searches , and more doctor visits than are listed even in the detailed explanation and two potential answers that keep popping up are PD or MSA which my doctors are dismissing ( understandably but simultaneously frustratingly so ) . Yet reading so many personal accounts online seem to keep pointing me back in that direction . Does the speed of these symptoms seem to match with PD onset ?

{"id":2684649325,"data":{"text_raw":"Hi all ive been reading a lot of your stories and posts and thought i would share . Im a 39 year old male , living in Ireland . I have been attending a neuro for 4 years under query of ms . I've had an mri done every year , spinal tap , bloods , nerve conduction study and all negative appart from a lesion at c3 that was present on an mri in 2015 but has subsequently shrunk and disappeared . Brain scans showed moderate brain atrophy in 2015 but that has also improved to be no notable atrophy this year . I have symptoms of numbness and tingling in legs and arms , bowel ( constipation and diarrhoea in one day ) and bladder problems , balance problems , my left foot feels like its in a boot all the time and my toes , hands and calf muscles spasm most days . Ive also lost feeling on my left leg around the ankle area . Im quite fit and run and exercise a good bit but theres days when i cant manage a flight of stairs . Recently after doing some gardening work , I lost power in my arms for about two weeks , unable to squeeze toothpaste or open a jar and after two weeks the power and feeling returned . If its cold out my hands and feet go numb almost immediately and I lose dexterity in them and the toes on my left foot go numb almost as soon as i start to walk or run . If its hot out , im sweating buckets and buzzing all over . Quite a lot going on but most of it is more of an annoyance and for the most part it doesnt stop me doing what I want to do but the sypmtoms im having keep seeing to increase and I'm picking up new ones as time goes on . The neurologist has diagnosed me with transverse myelitis and prescribed gabapentin and amyltripoline for the symptoms . Neither medication worked that well and when I bring this up with gp or Neuro they just increase the dosage which worked for a couple of weeks and then symptoms return . There seems to be a pattern to the symptoms in that they start to increase in severity over a period of a few weeks to the point where my whole body is buzzing and tingling , ill be unable to sleep for a couple of days and then it will slow down a bit but never really go away . Does anyone else on here have a similar diagnosis and do you have any idea of prognosis for the long or short term ?

Summary of other doctors visit , doc , speciality - one line summary . ​ I find some doc's ( often fresh out of school ) have too many patients . They are rushed , they have $ 500,000 in medical debt , and need to see patients as fast as possible ( higher turn over , the more than can bill ) . They can be great docs , but this is part of our medical system . So I try to make their job as easy as possible ( hence my summary page ) . It is up to us to be our own best advocate . Ideally have someone with you at all appointments to take notes . Requip can be used as an adjunct therapy ( in addition to ) a lower does of Sinemet , but telling a patient to swap on for the other could be a disaster .

{"id":2684649336,"data":{"text_raw":"1 . What do you use for focus / fatigue ? I'm back on Adderall ( which is awesome as I am also back on weight watchers so ... ) I was on Mofandil for a bit but health insurance approval was a bitch plus I didn't think was as good as Adderall 2 . Anyone else find essential oils with a diffuser helps with fatigue , negativity , and depression ? I do and I wanted to share and see if anyone has similar experiences or something they like better or is it psychosomatic ? If so , what scents do you find helpful ? 3 . Does anyone take nootropics ? I take [ these ] ( https://hvmn.com/nootrobox ) . I think they help , but again , psychosomatic ? Beats me 4 . I am an atheist but I am real into [ Discordianism ] ( http://discordia.wikia.com/wiki/Discordianism ) . As a 9/11 survivor who was DXed almost 3 months to the day after , well ... If I'm wrong and there is a God , when I get there she better get down on her knees and beg MY forgiveness . Do you find spirituality helps you ? What kind of things do you do for that sense of inner peace or at least feeling like the cross you bear isn't too heavy ? 5 . How do you deal with sexual issues ? I don't know if this is a Man thing or an Apikoros 18 thing but ... As mentioned by me in other posts , I need an injection ( trimix ) to achieve an erection . I cannot masturbate anymore but I still look at adult material . I still look at women , and even more want to have PIV intimacy with my wife . BUT , it can never be spontaneous anymore and with a 9 year old with special needs , even finding the time is difficult , let alone all the prep work . ( 15 mins for the meds after you take them from the freezer , than the injection , than 15 mins to get an erection ) Even then sometimes the meds don't work . They degrade over time and at 175 / $ a vial , you want to make it last as long as possible ( No pun intended . OK , maybe a little ) The bottom line is I still feel horny , I still get arouse ( in my head ) but the frustration of not being able to act on it ... It hurts me as a man .

{"id":2684649347,"data":{"text_raw":"African-Americans in major U . S . cities are significantly more likely to live in \" trauma deserts \" with limited access to advanced emergency medical care , according to new research from the University of Chicago Medicine . The study also shows the academic medical center's new Level 1 Trauma Center led to a seven-fold reduction in Chicago's access disparity . The findings , published March 8 in the Journal of the American Medical Association's Network Open , are the first to be released about the impact of UChicago Medicine's adult Level 1 Trauma Center . Adult trauma services at the hospital began in May 2018 . \" So much of the advocacy for the trauma center was framed in terms of racial equity , \" said Elizabeth Tung , MD , MS , a primary care physician and instructor of medicine at UChicago Medicine who was the paper's first author . \" But we realized no previous studies had addressed trauma access through the lens of race / ethnicity - not just looking at Chicago , but comparing our city to other communities as well . \" The research team examined access to trauma care in Chicago , New York and Los Angeles using a geospatial analysis that compared the location of designated trauma centers with the racial and ethnic composition of the cities ' census tracts . The project included only Level 1 and Level 2 Trauma Centers , which are able to provide medical care to patients with the most serious injuries . Using a standard established in previous research from colleagues at other hospitals , the team defined a \" trauma desert \" as any urban community that is at least five miles away from advanced trauma care . While many suburban and rural communities are significantly further away from trauma care , Tung said dense urban communities must be assessed differently . \" Five miles in a rural area is probably five minutes away , but in an urban area that same distance could be 15 minutes or it could be two hours away - it entirely depends on traffic congestion , \" Tung said . \" The kind of care in urban trauma also differs from that in rural areas - the types of trauma are generally different , the patient volume is higher and the injuries are more severe . \" Trauma centers provided advanced emergency medical care for patients with critical injuries , including those from motor vehicle accidents , falls , shootings and stabbings .

{"id":2684649354,"data":{"text_raw":"I was in a generic UK health store yesterday and noticed they now stock a supply of CBD products ; oils , serums , and creams . I try and use homeopathic therapies alongside prescribed medications ( obviously checking there are no contraindications ) and have read about CBD oil in the past and it's effectiveness in treatment with various diseases but the availability had been restricted .

{"id":2684649357,"data":{"text_raw":"IMAGE : A nanometer-sized pNT cylinder made of 40 benzenes . The cylinder is tens of thousands of times thinner than a human hair . Credit : ( c ) 2018 Hiroyuki Isobe . For the first time , researchers used benzene - a common hydrocarbon - to create a novel kind of molecular nanotube , which could lead to new nanocarbon-based semiconductor applications . Researchers from the Department of Chemistry have been hard at work in their recently renovated lab in the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Science . The pristine environment and smart layout affords them ample opportunities for exciting experiments . Professor Hiroyuki Isobe and colleagues share an appreciation for \" beautiful \" molecular structures and created something that is not only beautiful but is also a first for chemistry . Their phenine nanotube ( pNT ) is beautiful to see for its pleasing symmetry and simplicity , which is a stark contrast to its complex means of coming into being . Chemical synthesis of nanotubes is notoriously difficult and challenging , even more so if you wish to delicately control the structures in question to provide unique properties and functions . Typical carbon nanotubes are famous for their perfect graphite structures without defects , but they vary widely in length and diameter . Isobe and his team wanted a single type of nanotube , a novel form with controlled defects within its nanometer-sized cylindrical structure allowing for additional molecules to add properties and functions . The researchers ' novel process of synthesis starts with benzene , a hexagonal ring of six carbon atoms . They use reactions to combine six of these benzenes to make a larger hexagonal ring called a cyclo-meta-phenylene ( CMP ) . Platinum atoms are then used which allow four CMPs to form an open-ended cube . When the platinum is removed , the cube springs into a thick circle and this is furnished with bridging molecules on both ends enabling the tube shape . It sounds complicated , but amazingly , this complex process successfully bonds the benzenes in the right way over 90 percent of the time . The key also lies in the symmetry of the molecule , which simplifies the process to assemble as many as 40 benzenes . These benzenes , also called phenines , are used as panels to form the nanometer-sized cylinder . The result is a novel nanotube structure with intentional periodic defects . Theoretical investigations show these defects imbue the nanotube with semiconductor characters . \" A crystal of pNT is also interesting : The pNT molecules are aligned and packed in a lattice rich with pores and voids , \" Isobe explains . \" These nanopores can encapsulate various substances which imbue the pNT crystal with properties useful in electronic applications . One molecule we successfully embedded into pNT was a large carbon molecule called fullerene ( C70 ) . \" \" A team lead by Kroto / Curl / Smalley discovered fullerenes in 1985 . It is said that Sir Harold Kroto fell in love with the beautiful molecule , \" continues Isobe . \" We feel the same way about pNT . We were shocked to see the molecular structure from crystallographic analysis . A perfect cylindrical structure with fourfold symmetry emerges from our chemical synthesis . \" \" After a few decades since the discovery , this beautiful molecule , fullerene , has found various utilities and applications , \" adds Isobe . \" We hope that the beauty of our molecule is also pointing to unique properties and useful functions waiting to be discovered . \" Zhe Sun , Koki Ikemoto , Toshiya M .

They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S .

In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories .

However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted .

Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted . However , the authors note that many other considerations should inform blood safety policies in addition to cost-effectiveness .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S .

In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories .

However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year . Widespread screening would only be cost-effective in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico and never in the 50 states . Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted .

Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted . However , the authors note that many other considerations should inform blood safety policies in addition to cost-effectiveness .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year . Widespread screening would only be cost-effective in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico and never in the 50 states . Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year .

Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S .

In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories .

However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis .

Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted . However , the authors note that many other considerations should inform blood safety policies in addition to cost-effectiveness .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year .

Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year .

Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S .

In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted .

Widespread screening would only be cost-effective in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico and never in the 50 states . Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted . However , the authors note that many other considerations should inform blood safety policies in addition to cost-effectiveness .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S .

In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories .

The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year .

Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S .

In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted .

Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year . Widespread screening would only be cost-effective in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico and never in the 50 states . Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted . However , the authors note that many other considerations should inform blood safety policies in addition to cost-effectiveness .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year . Widespread screening would only be cost-effective in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico and never in the 50 states . Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S .

In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories .

The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories .

However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted .

In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted . However , the authors note that many other considerations should inform blood safety policies in addition to cost-effectiveness .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S .

In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories .

However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year .

Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted .

Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted . However , the authors note that many other considerations should inform blood safety policies in addition to cost-effectiveness .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

{"id":2684658478,"data":{"text_raw":"Hi all ive been reading a lot of your stories and posts and thought i would share . Im a 39 year old male , living in Ireland . I have been attending a neuro for 4 years under query of ms . I've had an mri done every year , spinal tap , bloods , nerve conduction study and all negative appart from a lesion at c3 that was present on an mri in 2015 but has subsequently shrunk and disappeared . Brain scans showed moderate brain atrophy in 2015 but that has also improved to be no notable atrophy this year . I have symptoms of numbness and tingling in legs and arms , bowel ( constipation and diarrhoea in one day ) and bladder problems , balance problems , my left foot feels like its in a boot all the time and my toes , hands and calf muscles spasm most days . Ive also lost feeling on my left leg around the ankle area . Im quite fit and run and exercise a good bit but theres days when i cant manage a flight of stairs . Recently after doing some gardening work , I lost power in my arms for about two weeks , unable to squeeze toothpaste or open a jar and after two weeks the power and feeling returned . If its cold out my hands and feet go numb almost immediately and I lose dexterity in them and the toes on my left foot go numb almost as soon as i start to walk or run . If its hot out , im sweating buckets and buzzing all over . Quite a lot going on but most of it is more of an annoyance and for the most part it doesnt stop me doing what I want to do but the sypmtoms im having keep seeing to increase and I'm picking up new ones as time goes on . The neurologist has diagnosed me with transverse myelitis and prescribed gabapentin and amyltripoline for the symptoms . Neither medication worked that well and when I bring this up with gp or Neuro they just increase the dosage which worked for a couple of weeks and then symptoms return . There seems to be a pattern to the symptoms in that they start to increase in severity over a period of a few weeks to the point where my whole body is buzzing and tingling , ill be unable to sleep for a couple of days and then it will slow down a bit but never really go away . Does anyone else on here have a similar diagnosis and do you have any idea of prognosis for the long or short term ? I have a hard time understanding how or why symptoms would appear new or get worse if the lesion has actually shrunk .","annotations_gold":["{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"25d5b6103bb346b3d3ce80cb8aef914812020b4b4ef3e7f4440d1ba79286ed48\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"],"annotations_gold_reason":[""],"does_not_contain_age_mention_gold_reason":[""],"annotation_gold":["{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"29efc6d0403cfabbc118cf9860fd79d6c0de2e64e7de875f7b1ce4b4f767f7c8\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"],"annotation_gold_reason":[""]},"judgments_count":144,"state":"golden","agreement":0.0,"missed_count":103,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2020-03-13T15:16:08+00:00","updated_at":"2020-03-13T18:20:03+00:00","job_id":1558687,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":5516721376,"created_at":"2020-03-13T15:29:39+00:00","started_at":"2020-03-13T15:25:32+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"feca","golden":true,"missed":true,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"VEN","region":"25","city":"Caracas","unit_id":2684658478,"job_id":1558687,"worker_id":45347510,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.887164747017688,"unit_state":"golden","data":{"annotations":"{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"29efc6d0403cfabb8e21dbd1c3402ff6c90a31c99d66dbd7\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"},"unit_data":{"text_raw":"Hi all ive been reading a lot of your stories and posts and thought i would share .

Recently after doing some gardening work , I lost power in my arms for about two weeks , unable to squeeze toothpaste or open a jar and after two weeks the power and feeling returned . If its cold out my hands and feet go numb almost immediately and I lose dexterity in them and the toes on my left foot go numb almost as soon as i start to walk or run . If its hot out , im sweating buckets and buzzing all over . Quite a lot going on but most of it is more of an annoyance and for the most part it doesnt stop me doing what I want to do but the sypmtoms im having keep seeing to increase and I'm picking up new ones as time goes on . The neurologist has diagnosed me with transverse myelitis and prescribed gabapentin and amyltripoline for the symptoms . Neither medication worked that well and when I bring this up with gp or Neuro they just increase the dosage which worked for a couple of weeks and then symptoms return . There seems to be a pattern to the symptoms in that they start to increase in severity over a period of a few weeks to the point where my whole body is buzzing and tingling , ill be unable to sleep for a couple of days and then it will slow down a bit but never really go away . Does anyone else on here have a similar diagnosis and do you have any idea of prognosis for the long or short term ? I have a hard time understanding how or why symptoms would appear new or get worse if the lesion has actually shrunk .","annotations_gold":["{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"25d5b6103bb346b3d3ce80cb8aef914812020b4b4ef3e7f4440d1ba79286ed48\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"],"annotations_gold_reason":[""],"does_not_contain_age_mention_gold_reason":[""],"annotation_gold":["{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"29efc6d0403cfabbc118cf9860fd79d6c0de2e64e7de875f7b1ce4b4f767f7c8\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"],"annotation_gold_reason":[""]}},{"id":5516739959,"created_at":"2020-03-13T15:37:22+00:00","started_at":"2020-03-13T15:29:35+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"feca","golden":true,"missed":false,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"WA","city":"Seattle","unit_id":2684658478,"job_id":1558687,"worker_id":45598070,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.878888888888889,"unit_state":"golden","data":{"annotations":"{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"29efc6d0403cfabba88e4b3d04e1a5ec17e3dff83b76d7a5\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"},"unit_data":{"text_raw":"Hi all ive been reading a lot of your stories and posts and thought i would share .

I have symptoms of numbness and tingling in legs and arms , bowel ( constipation and diarrhoea in one day ) and bladder problems , balance problems , my left foot feels like its in a boot all the time and my toes , hands and calf muscles spasm most days . Ive also lost feeling on my left leg around the ankle area . Im quite fit and run and exercise a good bit but theres days when i cant manage a flight of stairs . Recently after doing some gardening work , I lost power in my arms for about two weeks , unable to squeeze toothpaste or open a jar and after two weeks the power and feeling returned . If its cold out my hands and feet go numb almost immediately and I lose dexterity in them and the toes on my left foot go numb almost as soon as i start to walk or run . If its hot out , im sweating buckets and buzzing all over . Quite a lot going on but most of it is more of an annoyance and for the most part it doesnt stop me doing what I want to do but the sypmtoms im having keep seeing to increase and I'm picking up new ones as time goes on . The neurologist has diagnosed me with transverse myelitis and prescribed gabapentin and amyltripoline for the symptoms . Neither medication worked that well and when I bring this up with gp or Neuro they just increase the dosage which worked for a couple of weeks and then symptoms return . There seems to be a pattern to the symptoms in that they start to increase in severity over a period of a few weeks to the point where my whole body is buzzing and tingling , ill be unable to sleep for a couple of days and then it will slow down a bit but never really go away . Does anyone else on here have a similar diagnosis and do you have any idea of prognosis for the long or short term ? I have a hard time understanding how or why symptoms would appear new or get worse if the lesion has actually shrunk .","annotations_gold":["{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"25d5b6103bb346b3d3ce80cb8aef914812020b4b4ef3e7f4440d1ba79286ed48\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"],"annotations_gold_reason":[""],"does_not_contain_age_mention_gold_reason":[""],"annotation_gold":["{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"29efc6d0403cfabbc118cf9860fd79d6c0de2e64e7de875f7b1ce4b4f767f7c8\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"],"annotation_gold_reason":[""]}},{"id":5516745408,"created_at":"2020-03-13T15:39:24+00:00","started_at":"2020-03-13T15:30:54+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"feca","golden":true,"missed":true,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"VEN","region":"06","city":"Puerto Ordaz","unit_id":2684658478,"job_id":1558687,"worker_id":45372577,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.907532467532467,"unit_state":"golden","data":{"annotations":"{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"29efc6d0403cfabba32810d13ba232aa94d3fbaaf7017ab9\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"},"unit_data":{"text_raw":"Hi all ive been reading a lot of your stories and posts and thought i would share .

Brain scans showed moderate brain atrophy in 2015 but that has also improved to be no notable atrophy this year . I have symptoms of numbness and tingling in legs and arms , bowel ( constipation and diarrhoea in one day ) and bladder problems , balance problems , my left foot feels like its in a boot all the time and my toes , hands and calf muscles spasm most days . Ive also lost feeling on my left leg around the ankle area . Im quite fit and run and exercise a good bit but theres days when i cant manage a flight of stairs . Recently after doing some gardening work , I lost power in my arms for about two weeks , unable to squeeze toothpaste or open a jar and after two weeks the power and feeling returned . If its cold out my hands and feet go numb almost immediately and I lose dexterity in them and the toes on my left foot go numb almost as soon as i start to walk or run . If its hot out , im sweating buckets and buzzing all over . Quite a lot going on but most of it is more of an annoyance and for the most part it doesnt stop me doing what I want to do but the sypmtoms im having keep seeing to increase and I'm picking up new ones as time goes on . The neurologist has diagnosed me with transverse myelitis and prescribed gabapentin and amyltripoline for the symptoms . Neither medication worked that well and when I bring this up with gp or Neuro they just increase the dosage which worked for a couple of weeks and then symptoms return . There seems to be a pattern to the symptoms in that they start to increase in severity over a period of a few weeks to the point where my whole body is buzzing and tingling , ill be unable to sleep for a couple of days and then it will slow down a bit but never really go away . Does anyone else on here have a similar diagnosis and do you have any idea of prognosis for the long or short term ? I have a hard time understanding how or why symptoms would appear new or get worse if the lesion has actually shrunk .","annotations_gold":["{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"25d5b6103bb346b3d3ce80cb8aef914812020b4b4ef3e7f4440d1ba79286ed48\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"],"annotations_gold_reason":[""],"does_not_contain_age_mention_gold_reason":[""],"annotation_gold":["{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"29efc6d0403cfabbc118cf9860fd79d6c0de2e64e7de875f7b1ce4b4f767f7c8\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"],"annotation_gold_reason":[""]}},{"id":5516747258,"created_at":"2020-03-13T15:40:08+00:00","started_at":"2020-03-13T15:35:46+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"clixsense","golden":true,"missed":false,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"VEN","region":"23","city":"Maracaibo","unit_id":2684658478,"job_id":1558687,"worker_id":45230085,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":1.0,"unit_state":"golden","data":{"annotations":"{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"29efc6d0403cfabb925d747d7024beb04e23ad7d51cd600b\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"},"unit_data":{"text_raw":"Hi all ive been reading a lot of your stories and posts and thought i would share .

I have symptoms of numbness and tingling in legs and arms , bowel ( constipation and diarrhoea in one day ) and bladder problems , balance problems , my left foot feels like its in a boot all the time and my toes , hands and calf muscles spasm most days . Ive also lost feeling on my left leg around the ankle area . Im quite fit and run and exercise a good bit but theres days when i cant manage a flight of stairs . Recently after doing some gardening work , I lost power in my arms for about two weeks , unable to squeeze toothpaste or open a jar and after two weeks the power and feeling returned . If its cold out my hands and feet go numb almost immediately and I lose dexterity in them and the toes on my left foot go numb almost as soon as i start to walk or run . If its hot out , im sweating buckets and buzzing all over . Quite a lot going on but most of it is more of an annoyance and for the most part it doesnt stop me doing what I want to do but the sypmtoms im having keep seeing to increase and I'm picking up new ones as time goes on . The neurologist has diagnosed me with transverse myelitis and prescribed gabapentin and amyltripoline for the symptoms . Neither medication worked that well and when I bring this up with gp or Neuro they just increase the dosage which worked for a couple of weeks and then symptoms return . There seems to be a pattern to the symptoms in that they start to increase in severity over a period of a few weeks to the point where my whole body is buzzing and tingling , ill be unable to sleep for a couple of days and then it will slow down a bit but never really go away . Does anyone else on here have a similar diagnosis and do you have any idea of prognosis for the long or short term ? I have a hard time understanding how or why symptoms would appear new or get worse if the lesion has actually shrunk .","annotations_gold":["{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"25d5b6103bb346b3d3ce80cb8aef914812020b4b4ef3e7f4440d1ba79286ed48\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"],"annotations_gold_reason":[""],"does_not_contain_age_mention_gold_reason":[""],"annotation_gold":["{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"29efc6d0403cfabbc118cf9860fd79d6c0de2e64e7de875f7b1ce4b4f767f7c8\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"],"annotation_gold_reason":[""]}},{"id":5516776655,"created_at":"2020-03-13T15:52:04+00:00","started_at":"2020-03-13T15:40:56+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"feca","golden":true,"missed":true,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"USA","region":"NJ","city":"Clifton","unit_id":2684658478,"job_id":1558687,"worker_id":45449943,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.998360655737705,"unit_state":"golden","data":{"annotations":"{\"job_id\":1558687,\"annotation_id\":\"29efc6d0403cfabbfc38ec224f8f2a0cb5c1d0c2543cbff6\",\"custom_bucket\":false}"},"unit_data":{"text_raw":"Hi all ive been reading a lot of your stories and posts and thought i would share .
