medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4603601662078930694/You-Don't-Say	"She will get there in her own time. February 8, 2019 by Mary1991 1 Comment. For the last twelve months, I've not kept up with this blog. In my defense, I had been asked to write a weekly column about Jessie's life with Angelman Syndrome . I'm amazed that I was able to complete a year but I'm finding, at this stage, I don't have as much to share as I once did. There was no Facebook when Jess was born and there was no such thing as blogging. There were so many challenges, I wouldn't have run out of things to say so quickly! Not until Jess turned 13 did we learn her true diagnosis. Even so, it was another seven years before I found other Angelman parents and realized there was a community, All that time, I felt as though we were forging the road alone. I followed the lead of her teachers and doctors under the belief they knew what to do because they were the experts. I was just an overwhelmed mother who had no idea how to help other than take Jess to any and all therapy that we thought would break the spell. Long ago I learned about auditory learners, visual learners and people like me who needed to be hands on. Jessie had a smidgen of all the above but not enough of each style for her to make much progress. Couple that with being non-verbal, we had no idea what she was thinking much less understanding. Sure, as a mom, we get pretty good at anticipating needs but this is far from having the ability to read a person's mind. To add to Jessie's complex learning style, there was a complete disconnection with motor planning. Though I could see that she knew what belonged together and what was needed to make something work, she had no ability to get her eyes and hands to work together to make it happen. No one recognized that her depth perception was severely compromised (due to her right eye drifting, it should have been obvious to the trained eye, no pun intended. If you asked her to tap a picture of an apple, she tapped a photo of a puppy instead, it was assumed she hadn't a clue what you were talking about. Being that hindsight is 20/20, she didn't have the eye-hand coordination to touch the apple (but touched every picture around it in a perfect circle, yet again, this should have been an obvious clue) and so ended up touching something that interested her. Oh, how frustrating those “old days” were. However, today is a new day and we have resolved many of the barriers that held her back from learning. Though Jess isn't a typical 20-something, we are witnessing her grow into a unique and lovely young woman. Though this isn't the life I would have chosen, I am grateful for what I've learned because of her. When there isn't a road, you need to make your own. Don't fall into the trap and let others predict your child's fate. For us, we had to break away and go rogue . If something isn't working, it's crazy to keep thinking that doing the same thing over and over is going to change the outcome. I know that has been said so many times before but it is so very true. I wish I could say I'm working daily on her independence, however, my effort is better compared to a roller coaster. There are days we work diligently and then there are days we coast. Twists and turns can be scary, however, more times than not, we find ourselves coasting in at days end with little drama, ready to begin the next day with joyful anticipation. Though Jess has (and will always have) a long way to go, we are pleased with the progress she has made. She has transitioned to where she helps me more than makes me work. No longer does she resent me for asking more of her and the end result is we both have more freedom to pursue what makes us happy. It's odd to say but I feel blessed that Jess has been my teacher. Hopefully, she feels the same way. Sometimes Mama needs rest and sometimes she needs a cocktail but most of all, we moms should not be too hard on ourselves. There's always more to do than time. Some days we are able to cross out items on the todo list, and other days we find ourselves going nowhere fast. As Scarlett O'Hara said, “Tomorrow is another day”. It doesn't matter how long it takes her to get there, she will in her own time. PS- I don't really know where “there” is, I can't see around the bend but as she needs me less, I feel as though we are getting closer to our destination. Filed Under: Now we are talking."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4679917507794033330/Genetic-therapy-may-help-children-with-Angelman-syndrome-to-overcome-seizures	"Reviewed by James Ives, MPsych Nov 21 2018. Angelman syndrome is a genetic disease with no cure. Children grow up with severe intellectual disabilities and a range of other problems, arguably the worst of which are epileptic seizures. Now scientists at the UNC School of Medicine have found evidence that genetic therapy may prevent the enhanced seizure susceptibility. Published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , the research marks the first time scientists were able to reduce seizure susceptibility in mice by activating a dormant copy of the UBE3A gene so it could replace the faulty mutant version. While replacing the faulty gene in juveniles reduced seizures, replacing the faulty gene in adult mice had no effect. The UNC scientists also found evidence that the loss of this gene in Angelman syndrome promotes seizures by impairing the normal activity of inhibitory neurons - cells that normally keep brain circuits from being overstimulated. ""These findings should be very useful in the development and testing of therapies for Angelman syndrome,"" said senior author Benjamin D. Philpot, PhD, Kenan Distinguished Professor in the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, associate director of the UNC Neuroscience Center, and member of the UNC Autism Research Center. Angelman syndrome, named for the pediatrician who first described it in 1965, afflicts roughly one in 20,000 people, which implies that there are more than 16,000 people with the syndrome in the United States alone. The syndrome is caused by the loss of function of a single gene, UBE3A, but with an odd twist: the mutant or deleted copy of UBE3A is the one inherited from the patient's mother. This maternal copy is crucial in neurons because - for reasons still unknown - the paternal copy of UBE3A is silenced in these cells via a mechanism called genomic imprinting. UBE3A encodes a protein that works in an important cellular waste-disposal and gene-regulating system. Precisely how the absence of this protein in neurons causes Angelman syndrome has never been clear. Even so, scientists have been working on candidate therapies to restore UBE3A activity in neurons, thereby preventing or reversing some or all of the features of the disease. Among these features is epilepsy, which afflicts about 90 percent of Angelman syndrome patients, who typically do not respond well to standard anti-seizure medications. Some aspects of the disease reflect abnormal prenatal and early postnatal development, and may never be reversible with treatments that start years after birth. But epilepsy often doesn't start in Angelman patients until age 2 or 3, suggesting that early life replacement of UBE3A might cure it or prevent it. Philpot and colleagues decided to investigate how early the gene reinstatement needed to take place. They took advantage of an Angelman syndrome mouse model, in which researchers inserted a working copy of the UBE3A gene that would lie dormant in brain cells until scientists turned it on with a chemical switch. Related Stories. The scientists found that switching on UBE3A failed to prevent or reverse the high susceptibility to seizures in adult Angelman mice. However, switching on the gene when the mice were just three weeks old made them as resistant to seizures as ordinary mice. ""Three weeks of age for a mouse corresponds to early childhood for a human, so this suggests that there may be a window of opportunity in childhood for the prevention of Angelman syndrome epilepsy,"" said first author Bin Gu, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the Philpot Lab who performed most of the key experiments. Another big question for Angelman syndrome researchers has to do with the neurons affected by the disease. Philpot wondered, to treat the condition successfully, would UBE3A activity need to be restored in all types of neurons or just in some? Philpot's team removed functional UBE3A from excitatory neurons - which trigger activity in connected neurons - and observed that the resulting mice were unaffected. Then they blocked the gene just in inhibitory neurons, whose activity normally quiets and regulates connected neurons, thereby preventing the neural hyperactivity that can trigger seizures. With UBE3A gone from the inhibitory neurons, the mice became even more susceptible to seizures than if UBE3A were absent from all neurons. ""This result implies that if you want to limit epilepsy in Angelman syndrome, you'll need at least to restore the function of UBE3A in inhibitory neurons,"" Philpot said. The researchers gained another clue to the mechanism of Angelman syndrome seizures when they examined the brains of the seizure-prone mice, particularly in an area of the brain known as the hippocampus. They detected an abnormal accumulation of perineuronal nets (PNNs) - structures that surround neurons and block them from making new connections. Abnormal PNN formation has previously been linked to seizures. The scientists found that the abnormal PNN deposition did not occur in the young mice where UBE3A activity had been restored. ""We can now think of these abnormal PNNs as biomarkers for enhanced seizure susceptibility,"" Philpot said. ""We now want to determine if these structures actually cause seizure susceptibility, for example by disrupting the connections that inhibitory neurons normally would make in this brain region."" Philpot and collaborators at UNC, along with other researchers elsewhere, are working on potential Angelman syndrome treatments, including drugs that would activate the previously silenced paternal copy of UBE3A in brain cells.

"medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4668868390318136113/New-data-back-Ovids-Angelman-drug,-say-analysts"	"After reporting mixed results in a midstage trial earlier this year, Ovid Therapeutics has new data for its OV101 drug for rare disease Angelman syndrome that it says are looking a lot stronger. The STARS trial—reported at the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) conference this week—is the first industry-sponsored trial in Angelman, a disorder caused by a defect in the UBE3A gene that leads to delayed development, seizures, sleep problems and others medical issues. Ovid reported preliminary results from the STARS trial in August, with improvements across a range of measures that helped it achieve a significant improvement in Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scale from a single 15mg dose of OV101 given in the evening, and backed its safety and tolerability. There was some debate about the earlier readout, with analysts at Ladenburg Thalman saying it “suggested minimal benefits in sleep, motor, behavior or quality of life.” However, they now suggest the new data at AACAP has firmed up OV101’s clinical profile with “additional secondary endpoints with statistically significant or trends toward improvements.”. OV101 is a selective extra-synaptic GABA A receptor agonist vying to become the first-ever approved therapy for Angelman, which occurs in around 1 in 15,000 live births and is often misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy or autism. CEO Jeremy Levin said on a conference call that with the STARS data in hand, the plan now is to start an open-label extension study before the end of the year for all OV101-treated patients, using the 15mg once daily dose. “We believe the data…will support an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA by the end of the year,” he continued, and that should clarify the clinical requirements for a regulatory filing. Ladenburg Thalman think the likelihood is a second phase 2 trial in 2019 with a phase 3 study the following year, but suggest that Ovid may be able to proceed with a single phase 2/3 trial “as there is nothing approved or adequately used today to treat the problematic behaviors of Angelman.”. Other companies targeting Angelman include GeneTx Biotherapeutics , a startup launched by the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics (FAST) earlier this year that is focusing on the developing of antisense drugs for the disorder, and Marinus Pharma, which has a drug called ganaxolone in preclinical development for Angelman that has a similar mechanism of action to OV101. Other players include Sage Therapeutics and Zynerba Pharma."	"247,252"	2		"257,267"	2																																																																															
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4647532511052081697/Angelman-Syndrome-Find-a-Buddy	"August 27, 2018 by Mary1991 4 Comments. For most of Jessie's years, we didn't know any Angel parents. We were on our own to reinvent the wheel, navigating seizures, and sleep disturbances. Even though we heard a few words and phrases, upon learning of her Angleman diagnosis (when she was 13), I let go of the hope that Jess would talk in a traditional way. I wish I had someone that I could have shared with that understood. Earlier this week, I met with the only local Angel mom I know. We met by chance at a dance. Ashley was a chaperone. As soon as she saw Jessie, she suspected she was an Angel because she has one too. She made it her mission to meet the rest of the family before Jess left that night. Even though our children are different ages and stages, this hasn't prevented us from appreciating each other's perspective. Unfortunately, we don't get to visit that often, but when we do, we talk about anything and everything and of course, all things Angel. We all don't have the luxury of being with an Angelman mom/dad but we all can find a cyber one. I don't know if this will work but with two other Angel parents, we have just started a new Facebook group, Angelman Syndrome-Find a Buddy. (for lack of better name). This is not another chat group. The sole purpose is to find another parent to connect to on a more personal level so we can reduce that feeling of being isolated. Every day, I read a parent announce they just were given a diagnosis. Others feel isolated because their needs are different from families who have typical children. Even when we were part of playgroups, I ended up being with Jess while the other mom's got to talk because Jess needed my support. Eventually, the divide grows wider as their children meet milestones at a much faster rate. For other parents with older children, their friends become empty nesters. Going out as couples became awkward because they don't want your third wheel. Believe me, I understand wanting a child-free zone and the luxury of being with just adults, however, we rarely get to do that. My new motto is, “If you are an Angelman parent and don't know another Angelman parent, then get one”! Why specifically an Angelman parent? Because firsthand experience means you don't have to explain yourself. Sharing common interests is integral to any friendship and this opportunity could be the beginning of beautiful friendships! Some of you may already have your Angel-supports in place but maybe you could be a mentor to a young family? Maybe you or someone you know was recently diagnosed and want to invite them to this group? Or maybe you want to be part of the “3 am” club because your kid has you up all night. This venue would allow you to find others “awake” at the same time. There might be a better forum to use than FB in that it could be set up in a more efficient way, however, this is what we have to work with. To begin, Join, Angelman Syndrome-Find a Buddy. Then add a brief post about yourself and what kind of support you would like to find. Maybe you are searching for one parent or maybe you want to form a group (of three or four), or maybe you want to find someone where you check in once a week to see how they are doing? (You might find that you are FB friends already so this would be an opportunity to get to know them better).These are just suggestions. It's up to you to decide how to proceed. I don't know if this will work but I do know that Angelman parents are a very loving and supportive community. I've been blessed to make connections with families from around the world. Having friends in multiple time zones has been awesome! This week, we will be tagging our friends to join this group. I'm afraid we may duplicate requests, if we do, please don't be annoyed. Since this is the launch, there should be a period of time for this group to build before connecting. I'd like to suggest that Buddy finding begins on September 15, 2018. Either this will be a flash of brilliance or an epic fail. Even if only a few connections are made, I'll consider this a success, however, it could be so much more. This will only work if you are willing to play. I hope you do! Filed Under: Now we are talking."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4642110840359238659/She-found-her-voice-by-Chance	"August 11, 2018 by Mary1991 7 Comments. The front and back of Jessie's new business card. Over the last three years, we have shared over 500 business cards and now we have run out. These cards were given to people who either needed information or were so curious, they'd ask questions I didn't find appropriate answering. Besides, I don't believe we should talk about someone in front of them, it's rude. With Jess's permission, the cards allow us to share her story. We needed an updated look for her card. By happenchance, this photo was taken outside of the shop, Chance on Main . Their mission statement is:. a for-purpose boutique and gallery. because sometimes all you need. is a CHANCE”. If it weren't for the founder of Chance, we might not have had a story to tell. It was late one fall when I expressed my frustrations with her that Jessie did not have a reliable way to communicate. In turn, she mentioned this to her son's therapist and their response was, “I know someone who is a whiz with computers and AAC ”, and this is how we found the app Speak for Yourself . It made perfect sense for Jess to chose a photo of her holding Lucy the bull by the horns. In essence, this is what she did in order to find her voice. If you want something bad enough, you need to take matters into your own hands. The first words Jess said to me this morning were, “I love you”. Sure, she could have expressed this in a non-verbal way, but there is nothing more powerful than hearing it said. I hope that when we share her card, not only do people take the time to learn about Angelman Syndrome but they realize how vital it is to be able to choose your own words.

"medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4640181778223030676/Ovid-posts-results-from-midstage-rare-disease-test,-plots-registrational-path"	"Ovid Therapeutics has posted a batch of topline data out of its midstage STARS trial in Angelman syndrome as it seeks out a path to approval. The study was focused on safety and tolerability, and saw OV101 hit its primary endpoint in several of these markers, although it failed to beat out placebo in a series of subsets. The phase 2 trial was set up with 88 patients randomized across three groups: a once-daily or twice-daily dose of OV101 or placebo. Your Daily Newsletter — Free. Enjoying this story?

The biotech says that at 12 weeks of treatment, OV101 “showed a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in the physician-rated clinical global impressions of improvement (CGI-I).”. Specifically, it showed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0206; Fisher’s exact test) between the combined OV101 treatment arms and placebo. “This reflects an improvement in two-thirds of the combined treatment groups versus one-third in placebo,” the startup explained. This is a measure commonly used in a test geared to help doctors capture a series of clinical symptoms, and Ovid says that CGI-I was “ranked first in the topline statistical plan.”. RELATED:. Overall, Ovid says that the study met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability given that the adverse events (AEs) with OV101 treatment were similar to placebo. The most common AEs reported in the trial were vomiting, somnolence, irritability, aggression, and pyrexia. In addition, “subsequent analyses in the hierarchy were conducted on a prespecified subset of scales across the domains of behavior, sleep and gait.”. But the company says that the analysis of these prespecified subsets “did not show a statistically significant difference from placebo,” adding that full data analyses on these domains “are ongoing,” and they’ll get back to us on what they find in the future. The drug is seeking to treat Angelman syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that can cause delayed development, seizures, sleep problems and other medical issues. OV101 is a selective extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonist in development that can mediate tonic inhibition, a key underlying pathophysiological mechanism of Angelman syndrome. This medication, from Lundbeck and Merck, was put on the scrap heap nearly a decade ago, after the pair failed to get it through the clinic for insomnia. Ovid is hoping the new test and insights will reveal the hidden value of this once-failed drug. On the back of the STARS data, Ovid now says it “intends to discuss these data with regulatory authorities to determine the next steps for a registrational pathway” and plots to start an open-label extension study (named ELARA) in the fourth quarter. “We are excited by these data, as this is the first demonstration of positive clinical effect on overall symptomology in Angelman syndrome,” said Jeremy Levin, D.Phil., MB, BChir, chairman and chief executive of Ovid. “In collaboration with the Angelman community, we designed a robust study to evaluate prespecified endpoints that may pave the way for a registrational pathway for a disorder that has no previously approved medicines. These data are a tribute to the patients and their families and we thank them.”. “These initial data from the STARS study are encouraging, particularly the statistically significant improvement in overall symptoms that we see in the CGI-I scale in the once-daily dosing group,” said Ron Thibert, D.O., MsPH, chairperson of the STARS clinical trial steering committee, director of the Angelman syndrome clinic at Mass General Hospital for Children, and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. “Angelman syndrome is a complex disorder and the CGI-I scale captures the totality of global neurological deficits and helps to define the impact of medicines on the individual and their families. “The data reported today are the first data in Angelman syndrome to show a compound specifically targeting the syndrome having a clinical effect. Ovid is the first company to have conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in Angelman syndrome, providing important clinical and scientific data. Based on these data, I believe OV101 has the potential to offer a clinically meaningful benefit specific to people living with Angelman syndrome.”. Investors weren't feeling great about the mixed data, sending the biotech's shares down 30% in early trading."																																																																																				
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4602543128140867774/Role-of-UBE3A-enzyme-in-Angelman-syndrome	"April 20, 2018. The group, led by the Ikerbasque professor Ugo Mayor of the UPV/EHU's Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, has just published in the journal Human Molecular Genetics an explanation of the mechanisms affected by Angelman syndrome. Thanks to an innovative, experimental design and the state-of-the-art infrastructure of the UPV/EHU's General Proteomics Research Service, they have managed to identify the changes in the proteins altered by the UBE3A enzyme, the malfunctioning of which in the brain leads to the disease. According to these new results, UBE3A is responsible for regulating the function of proteasome, a kind of shredding machine that regulates the balance of the other proteins in the cells. In this indirect way, UBE3A is responsible for the stability of a huge number of processes that take place within the cells. When there is a fault in the UBE3A, these processes do not take place correctly. This explains the complexity of the syndrome that emerges when the UBE3A enzyme fails to perform its function properly. The genetic origin and symptoms of this disease have been studied previously, but until now no explanation has been forthcoming as to how a single gene was capable of creating so many alternations in brain function. Angelman syndrome is a disease affecting one in every 15,000 newborn babies. It causes complex problems in the intellectual development of children, epilepsy, as well as difficulties in communicating, lack of motor coordination and problems in balance and movement accompanied by extremely few hours of sleep.

In diploid organisms, two copies of a gene are inherited − one from the mother and one from the father. For most genes, both alleles are expressed, but in a small subset, only one of the copies are expressed whilst the other is inactive. This is termed genomic imprinting. Credit: Yurchanka Siarhei/Shutterstock.com. Genomic imprinting means that specific genes inherited from the mother or father are active, whilst the gene inherited from the other parent is inactive. This preferential expression of one allele is important for normal development. Genomic imprinting is found in all mammals and investigation of this process has been aided by the presence of many conserved imprinted genes between mice and humans. Genomic imprinting and development. The role of genomic imprinting in development was first noted in uniparental mouse embryo studies. Embryos derived from two paternal pronuclei were found to lack embryonic tissues whilst the embryos derived from two maternal pronuclei developed without extraembryonic tissues. This indicated that imprinted genes with preferential expression of one inherited allele (either paternal or maternal), were central to normal development. The paternally expressed IGF2 gene was one of the first imprinted genes to be identified as a positive regulator of fetal growth. Interestingly, it’s expression is controlled by the maternally imprinted IGF2R gene. Imprinted genes also have an important role in neural development and function. Genomic imprinting provides unique gene expression in the brain that is separate from patterns seen in other tissues. One example is the UBE3A gene where both copies are expressed in most tissues but only the maternal copy is expressed in brain tissue where it promotes neural plasticity. Some imprinted genes are associated with specific neuronal subtypes that assist in the establishing diverse cell types within the brain tissue. Imprinting mechanisms. Genomic imprinting occurs through the marking of a gene during gamete production via different epigenetic mechanisms. Two major mechanisms by which genes are imprinted are DNA methylation and histone modifications. During DNA methylation, a methyl group is added to a segment of DNA and is employed in the identification of a maternal or paternal allele. The epigenetic process alters gene expression through imprinting without altering the DNA sequence. Histone modifications alter the chromatin structure leading to changes in gene expression. There are numerous modifications that can be applied to the histone for imprinting including histone acetylation, which forms an accessible chromatin formation, and histone deacetylation leading to compressed chromatin. After fertilization, specific imprints from each parent must be maintained during genome reprogramming. The final stage of genomic imprinting involves the erasure of the somatic pattern of biparental imprints. Genomic imprinting and disease inheritance. Some diseases occur as a result of deletions or mutations in imprinted genes. Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome were the first reported diseases associated with genomic imprinting in humans. The diseases have distinct symptoms though they are both caused by a deletion in the same region of chromosome 15. This is because the parental origin of the affected chromosome differs between the two syndromes. Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by the loss of paternally inherited genes whilst Angelman syndrome is caused by the loss of maternally inherited genes. The loss of paternally imprinted genes can occur because of unipaternal disomy, in this case where two copies of the maternal chromosome are inherited. In contrast, Angelman syndrome occurs through the loss of the single maternally expressed gene UBE3A within brain tissue. Genomic imprinting is also associated with the formation of certain cancers. A type of embryonic kidney cancer called Wilm’s tumor is associated with the loss of imprinting for two specific genes. In normal embryonic kidney cells, the imprinted maternal copy of H19 is expressed that has a growth suppression function along with the imprinted paternal copy of IGF2, a known growth factor. In Wilm’s tumor cells the imprinting of H19 and IGF2 is lost, meaning that the lack of H19 function causes an overexpression of IGF2 resulting in tumorigenesis. Reviewed by P Surat, PhD.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4603094513892415222/Mary1991	"When I started writing, three and a half years ago, there weren’t many blogs about young adults with Angelman Syndrome . It seemed once your child aged out of school, they might as well have dropped off the face of the planet. I wanted to know, what happens next? So, I started writing about Jess, an older Angel, hoping that something I said would help another parent. By sharing our journey, the mistakes, the lessons, and the success, maybe, just maybe someone else would benefit. In our own way, we have been trying to pave a way. At one time, there was little expectation for the Down Syndrome community. However, the parents pushed and questioned what they had been told was possible. By presuming competence and raising expectations, the perception with regards to abilities morphed into “anything is possible”. I believe the Angelman Community is following a similar path. When Jess was finally given the correct diagnosis (at 13), she was taken off the educational track and the focus was on self-help skills. This was done with my knowledge, however, I was naive. I didn’t realize why the change until years later. I didn’t realize that the diagnosis caused the shift. I dumbly followed schools lead believing they had her best interest at heart. Because communication is the foundation for learning, my main focus for this blog has been about AAC . These are the bullet points that you need to know:. 1. if you child isn’t able to communicate, you can ask the school for help, but most likely, you will need to research AAC apps and devices yourself. Be aware that SLP’s are not created equal and are not required to take courses in Augmentative and Alternative Communication. They learn after they graduate, on the job and many do this on their own time. Where once speech was about articulation, there’s a growing need for SLP’s to be versed in AAC technology. 2. When asking for supports from school, put it in writing. They will kindly blow smoke up your butt making you believe action is taking place when it is not. Requests do not exist unless it is in writing. 3. AAC evals are only as good as the person giving the evaluation. A two-week trial isn’t enough to know if the AAC is a match. 4. If you succeed in getting an AAC device, insist that it comes home with the child. Consider the device a voice prosthesis. A child wouldn’t leave a wheelchair at school and come home without one and they shouldn’t leave their voice at school either. 5. Ask for training, not just at school, but in the home too. You need to know how to support your child. How can they be successful with an AAC app unless you are able to model comfortably? You can’t just hand the child a device and expect them to talk and they especially need someone to talk to. 6. Get the whole family involved. Get your friends involved. Have your child out in the community using their Talker. Share with those that have never seen an AAC app in action so they understand this is your child’s voice and not a toy. Not only will this help your child but will make your child’s world bigger because it will encourage acceptance. 7. There is no such thing as too old to learn. For Jess to have a voice and the ability to speak for herself has been life-changing. If you are reading this and are waiting for school, do me a favor. Stop talking for an hour or two and try and communicate to your family. Or go out into the community and try and get help. You will learn quickly how difficult it is to not have a voice. So how old is your child that isn’t talking, seven, twelve, eighteen? Do you think you could be as patient without a voice as they are? If they’re acting out, then they have given you their opinion. If they aren’t responding, maybe they have given up. Jess was a combination of both. We are trying to make up for that now. It’s the best we can do. The point is, don’t wait for school. I guess I’m writing about this because I’m frustrated. It saddens me when I learn schools do not follow through and let time go by. Either it is due to ignorance or because they want to save their district money. This I know because I’ve had many teachers pull me aside over the years saying such. They’d share with me their concerns and how the administration has constrained them. I realize our schools are overwhelmed, however, you have to be the squeaky wheel. Unfortunately, I didn’t learn all of this until Jess was about to age out of school. I was ignorant about how technology was changing, however, the SFY app wasn’t available to Jess when she was eight (though that first device worked initially, it soon became apparent it didn’t meet her needs). I shudder to think what Jess’s life would have been like if we hadn’t found her voice when she turned 21. Fortunately, no child should have to wait that long anymore. PS- I forgot to mention, even though I was labeled “that over-involved parent” and teachers were “warned” about me (told to me recently by one of Jess’s teachers), I didn’t buck the system till her last two years of school. Up until then, I followed the school’s advice. In all transparency, I was that parent whose child didn’t have a (reliable) voice when she was 18."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4603247884561494096/News-|	"By Amberley Romo. It’s now been almost five years since I first wrote about future planning . I was 22, and living in Washington, DC — 1,300 miles away from my family in Dallas. At the time, my sister Caroline was 18. We were both entering new phases of our lives. I was fresh out of college, and she had just reached legal adulthood. (Her birthday milestones honestly were always more striking to me than my own). Caroline was born with a rare neuro-genetic disorder called Angelman syndrome . The prevalence of AS is estimated to be somewhere between 1/12,000 and 1/24,000. I was in third grade when we finally discovered my sister’s diagnosis. I know, because my mom tells the story of how I went to school, and told my third grade teacher that I was worried about how I would take care of Caroline when something happened to our parents. Years later, when my parents took our family out to dinner to celebrate my high school graduation, I have a perfect memory of sitting at the table feeling deeply guilty, and near tears. I was soon to move to DC for college. At the table, my parents expressed how important they thought it was that I go. When I later moved away to college, it was deeply unsettling for about a semester. Everything I had to do every day suddenly only revolved around, well, me. The years passed, and I thrived in DC. I love that city. It’s my home away from home. But I felt those tugs. Sometimes the feeling was quiet, sometimes it was loud; but it was there. Feeling too far away, feeling too selfish. Feeling the desire to be a present fixture in the lives of my family members — to be a more active part of Caroline’s care network. I’m now almost 28; she is almost 24. I lived in DC for eight years. Two years ago, I moved back to Texas. For one of those years, I lived in Dallas. It’s hard to explain the internal battle between feelings of obligation and not knowing with any certainty what you really want, personally. But you know what I’m talking about. It’s part of the human experience. It has nothing specifically to do with having a sibling with disabilities. It’s a universal experience. This is just a particularly salient part of how I experience this struggle. None of us can know if we’re making the right choices; We just do what we can, and keep moving forward. What I can say with certainty is that living in closer proximity to my sister deepened our connection considerably. When living further away, I could still say hi to her on the phone. (Or like when she somehow figured out how to FaceTime with me while I was at work and she was in class). But living back home, she would spend the night over at my apartment. We’d make dinner, and watch The Great British Baking Show. She loves to watch my pet rabbits run around. I got back in sync with her nonverbal cues, and she got back in sync with my micro-movements. (I swear to you she can tell when you’ve had a thought, and haven’t even said anything yet — her emotional intelligence is through the roof). It’s these subtleties that were difficult — near impossible, even — to maintain, in a long-distance relationship with her. There’s no right decision for me, or for other siblings. But I can say for certain that I don’t regret moving back to be closer. I was reflecting on these past ten years just recently; I was doing some work in a coffee shop, and a family came in. A mom, dad, older sister and younger brother. The younger brother had Down syndrome. They were all hanging his art on the coffee shop wall. As I understand it, the sister had independently reached out to the coffee shop about featuring her brother’s work, and the other artist currently featured on the wall had volunteered to share space. As I chatted with them, and watched as they arranged his art, I had an odd sense of deja vu. Reflecting on being the sister’s age, and pondering college. (She appeared to perhaps be in high school). These thoughts can feel so isolating, but they are such a deeply shared experience. Meeting them by happenstance reminded me of that. Growing up feels like continuously uncovering that behind the tapestry is a mess of loose ends. From chaos, comes order (or at least hindsight). When I was younger, I worried about Caroline’s future with a general sense of anxiety. Now that I’m older, I worry about increasingly complicated specifics. We have been having active planning conversations for years, and on some level, it grinds away in the back of my brain nonstop. Despite working so proactively, we still don’t feel close to having an answer, or feeling prepared. I hope that for anyone reading this, these thoughts inspire thoughtfulness, not paralysis. I accept that we can’t ever know anything for certain. It can be overwhelming, but I fervently hope that other siblings and families don’t shy away from these conversations.

The Arc and Walmart Foundation Renew Commitment to Providing Community-Based Employment For People With Disabilities. Posted on April 3, 2018 by The Arc. Washington, DC – The Arc’s employment program, The Arc@Work, is pleased to announce it has received a $325,000, one-year grant from the Walmart Foundation. This funding will be dedicated toward scaling the programs that The Arc@Work and Walmart have created over the past two years to train and place people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) in competitive, integrated employment within their communities. Employment rates for people with disabilities – especially people with I/DD – are critically low compared to people without disabilities. The US Census Bureau’s American Communities Survey (2015) estimates that people with any disability or a cognitive disability are employed at much lower rates (34.3% and 24.8% respectively) than those without disabilities (73.6%). Additionally, the National Core Indicators Survey of 2015-2016 reported that 19% of people with I/DD in the workforce reported having a paid job in the community. In response to these dire statistics, through funding from the Walmart Foundation, The Arc@Work has built a successful partnership in working with local chapters of The Arc to provide competitive and community-based employment opportunities and strengthening chapters’ relationships with local businesses since 2016. To do this, The Arc@Work provides technical assistance and an average sub-grant award of $10,000 to chapters of The Arc located across the country that provide community-based employment opportunities. Over this two-year span, the Walmart Foundation has supported The Arc@Work and chapters of The Arc located across the country in training more than 2,000 individuals and placing more than 800 individuals into competitive and community-based jobs. Additionally, participating chapters of The Arc have forged relationships with nearly 500 local and regional employers to provide trained job candidates and staff training on creating inclusive work environments. This new round of funding will allow for The Arc@Work and chapters of The Arc to achieve even greater impact over the next year. “For far too long, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities have been relegated to the margins of the working world. Along with private initiatives, new government regulations promise to dramatically increase the number of people with disabilities placed alongside of people without disabilities in integrated, competitive environments. The support from the Walmart Foundation will allow The Arc to continue to transform the existing pool of talented candidates with disabilities into productive employees,” said Peter Berns, CEO of The Arc. The Arc advocates for and serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD), including Down syndrome, autism, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, cerebral palsy and other diagnoses. The Arc has a network of over 650 chapters across the country promoting and protecting the human rights of people with I/DD and actively supporting their full inclusion and participation in the community throughout their lifetimes and without regard to diagnosis.

Posted on March 30, 2018 by The Arc. The Arc Wisconsin celebrates a major victory in Wisconsin, the passage of a ground-breaking Employment First bill that will hold state agencies accountable to update and improve policies, set benchmarks and report on their progress to increase the number of people with disabilities in Wisconsin working in competitive integrated employment. One of The Arc Wisconsin’s leading advocates for this legislation was Ashley Mathy of Rhinelander who has autism. In recognition of Wisconsin’s progress and Autism Acceptance Month, Ashley shares with us in her own words why this new law is so important to her and the thousands of people with disabilities in Wisconsin. By Ashley Mathy. Ashley Mathy from Wisconsin, who has autism, stands with Governor Scott Walker after he signed the state’s Employment First law on March 28. Hello, I am Ashley Mathy a self-advocate who has PDD, NOS (Autism spectrum). I have a simple answer to a question. The question is “When?”. Before I answer, please consider- as you know, the month of April is Autism Acceptance month. Education and awareness of Autism are so important to me personally because of my daily struggles with anxiety, social challenges and much more. So many people look at autism behaviors as strange versus accepting the person and all the wonderful gifts and abilities we can offer this world. On the positive side my challenges with Autism have given me the personal experience needed to share my stories, challenges and successes with so many people. Throughout this journey, it has made me realize that Autism doesn’t define me…it is just a word. The truth is I am a fighter. I am a warrior. I am a leader. I am a friend. I am a daughter. Doctors and teachers believed that I would not be able to work in the community and college would not be a likely option. I have proven doctors and teachers wrong by showing them I can overcome any obstacle that is put in front of me. I believe that you never know how strong you are unless you are put to the test…Autism was my test. Christopher Robin says: “You’re are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think” and who can argue with a Winnie the Pooh expert!! Today, I assist in the Dean’s office at Nicolet College, speak around the State of Wisconsin for disability advocacy and market Soap Sisters which stands for “Sister of Autism Princess”, (a company that my sister and I started) and take classes at Nicolet College. Ashley shared her employment story with many state legislators, including Representative James Edming pictured in this photo in the Wisconsin Capitol, to help get Wisconsin’s law passed. I am so proud and excited to be part of promoting the Employment First Law . Integrated employment for people with disabilities is by far my biggest advocacy goal. I personally know so many people with special needs that want to work AND contribute to their community, PLUS they want to make a positive impact in this world. We have so many talents they we can bring to the table such as being a reliable employee, positive can-do attitude and very hard worker. People with disabilities have that “fire” to get the job done to the best of their abilities while making every attempt to overcome any obstacles in a job. Personally, I struggled with finding the right job for my skills and abilities. I got caught between the priorities of all the agencies helping me find a job. After much determination, I found several jobs that are a perfect fit for me. With the passage of the Employment First bill, the agencies will be required to work together and develop a joint plan with the same goal in mind; securing employment for people with special needs. This teamwork will be a powerful tool for Wisconsin to move forward and for individuals to take their rightful place in the community and workforce. I believe the key to success in life is everyone working together towards the same common goal. The passage of this Employment First Bill and the determination of people with special needs along with the support of employers and agencies… will make a difference in lives, and ensure a WIN- TOGETHER! The answer to the question of, “When?”. My simple answer is, NOW- RIGHT NOW. Posted in Advocacy |. Tagged Autism Acceptance Month , Employment , Wisconsin. The Arc Joins Effort Calling on Department of Education to Keep Guidance on Treating All Students Fairly, including Students with Disabilities. Posted on March 23, 2018 by The Arc. The Arc has joined more than 140 national, state, and local organizations, led by The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, in a letter calling on the U.S. Department of Education (ED) to keep in place school discipline guidance. This guidance merely clarifies that the ED expects that schools and districts are treating all children fairly and provides practical tools and guidelines for educators to create safe, supportive, and welcoming environments for all students. In 2014, the federal guidance was issued with documents that provide important information and support for educators who want to create safer and more welcoming schools and important cautions for schools where problems of unequal treatment are not being addressed. The Arc and the organizations signing this letter maintain that rescinding the guidance would send the opposite message: that the ED does not care that schools are discriminating against children of color by disproportionately removing them from school and that ED does not see itself as having a role in helping educators create and maintain safe schools that afford all students equal educational opportunities. “We know that suspensions and expulsions have been used for far too long and too often in our schools and are used disproportionately against children of color and children with disabilities. This federal guidance helps to stop this trend, and rescinding it would harm the progress we have to make to live up to our commitment to a free and appropriate public education for minority students with disabilities,” said Peter Berns, CEO, The Arc.

Joe is 23 years old and is a very active advocate in his home state of New York. Joe is the outreach director for The Arc’s National Council of Self-Advocates, a board member for a local non-profit, and the former chair of a self-advocacy group called the Collaborative of New York. For the last several years, Joe has attended the Disability Policy Seminar in Washington, DC and participates in the lobby day to meet with his Members of Congress and talk about issues that are important to people with disabilities. Here is what Joe had to say about his advocacy and his advice for others who want to get involved to tell Congress #HandsOff important programs:. How did you get involved in advocacy? What is your favorite part of being an advocate? I’ve been doing advocacy my whole life! Once of my favorite examples of my advocacy work is when I was about 16, my dad took me to Albany, to the state capitol in New York to advocate for a bill to stop using the “r” word. It really resonated with me as a person with a disability. I heard that word in school a lot and I didn’t want people to use it anymore. My favorite part in general is attending learning sessions like at the Disability Policy Seminar so I can learn about the latest issues. My favorite part about meeting with legislators is getting my point across. Why do you think it’s important for people with disabilities to be strong advocates for programs like Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)? Programs like Medicaid and SSI help people with disabilities. Sometimes these programs are people’s only lifeline. They pretty much can’t live without it. It helps them to be independent. If Congress takes these programs away, many people will be impacted. If you’re not an advocate, those benefits may get taken away. What advice do you have for self-advocates who want to get started in advocacy? The first thing and the biggest thing, I would say, is find your local self-advocacy group. Self-advocacy groups can help you with tips on how to present to your legislators and how to get your message across, give you a chance to go to lobby days, and opportunities to meet with your legislators. They really help. You can learn about upcoming meetings for The Arc’s National Council of Self Advocates here . What tips do you have for self-advocates meeting with their legislators for the first time? I made a presentation with tips for self-advocates meeting with their legislators. You can see it here . One of the biggest things you have to do is have a group discussion, with whoever you are going with, to identify the issues you want to bring up at the meeting. It’s always good to invite other people to be part of the process, as long as they are people who support you. It’s always good to have other people be involved. Be clear on what you what you want the legislator to achieve and make sure you have stories on that topic. Sometimes you meet with a legislator or aide that don’t understand the issues or that we have disabilities – you just have to be patient and educate them.

Posted on March 12, 2018 by The Arc. The Arc has joined over 570 organizations, led by the National Fair Housing Alliance, calling on U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Dr. Ben Carson to retain references to creating “inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination” in the agency’s mission statement. Last week, 164 national organizations – including The Arc – and 409 state and local groups sent a letter to Secretary Carson following news accounts alleging that HUD is contemplating amending its mission statement to remove this language. “Across the United States, people with disabilities face a crisis when it comes to inclusive, affordable, and accessible housing in the community. Discrimination continues to be a major barrier: over half of fair housing claims filed in 2017 involved discrimination on the basis of disability. Many people with disabilities also face multiple barriers to housing based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, and religion, or familial status. “The Arc has been alarmed by recent news reports that HUD may be considering removing anti-discrimination language from its mission statement. We hope this is not the case. Removing this language would send the wrong message. We call on Secretary Carson to keep inclusion and freedom from discrimination front and center in all of HUD’s work, and to retain this important anti-discrimination language in HUD’s mission statement,” said Marty Ford, Senior Executive Officer, Public Policy, The Arc.

Washington, DC – The Arc is pleased to announce that its national employment program, The Arc@Work, has received an additional $122,000 over the next two years from the Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation to support its ongoing efforts to expand its partner program with Specialisterne®. The Arc@Work and Specialisterne®’s program consists of a four-week intensive training curriculum and on-the-job training designed to equip people with autism with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in entry-level IT jobs. Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation previously supported this project of The Arc with $105,000 in funding from 2015-2017. The Arc has a partnership with Specialisterne USA®, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization established by a Danish nonprofit organization, The Specialist People Foundation, that works to create meaningful employment for people with autism and similar challenges in the technology sector. The program engages top companies with IT needs interested in hiring young adults with ASD and pairs them with chapters of The Arc that provide the four-week training course, during which participants learn the basics about programming and data management while also improving soft skills. At the end of training, participants are hired into partner organizations as developers, programmers, analysts, and administrators. Employers also receive training on supporting employees with ASD and The Arc@Work and Specialisterne® work together to provide follow-up support for program participants. Chapters of The Arc in Philadelphia and New York were among the first to adopt the Specialisterne program in 2014, but the program has since been adopted by chapters in Tampa Bay and Washington, DC as well. The 2018-2019 grant from Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation will allow The Arc to expand this crucial program to new regions throughout the country. “Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation is committed to empowering young people with disabilities,” said Keijiro Hora, President of the Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation and CEO and President, Mitsubishi Electric US, Inc. “By continuing to support The Arc’s expansion of the. Specialisterne employment model, we hope to see increased numbers of young people with autism empowered to enter the competitive workforce and live productive lives,” continued Hora. The program emphasizes that many young adults with ASD are qualified to work in highly skilled positions and, with employer commitment and support, they can thrive in community-based jobs of their choosing. “There are many young people with ASD that possess the skills that are in high demand in the tech industry. This program plays matchmaker, and through our chapter network, we can not only connect a population we serve with employment in the community but also raise awareness in a major industry about what people with disabilities can do. It’s an exciting initiative and we are thrilled to have the Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation’s ongoing support,” said Peter Berns, CEO of The Arc. The Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation , based in the Washington, DC area, was established in 1991 by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and the Mitsubishi Electric U.S. companies, which produce, sell and distribute a wide range of consumer, industrial, commercial and professional electronics products. The foundation has contributed more than $15 million to organizations that are empowering young people with disabilities to lead more inclusive and productive lives.

Scranton, Pennsylvania already has a claim to fame as the setting for the TV show “The Office.” Now, The Arc of Northeastern Pennsylvania in Scranton is getting its own name out to the public by collaborating in community events honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and creating public service announcements. The Arc of Northeastern Pennsylvania (NEPA) was awarded a MLK Day of Service* grant for 2017. The city of Scranton has long recognized Dr. King’s commitment to service through the Greater Scranton MLK Commission, which promotes Dr. King’s principles of non-violence, equity and love through education and service. Every year, The Greater Scranton MLK Commission plans a full schedule of programs and special events that honor Dr. King’s life and legacy during the MLK Jr. holiday weekend. This year, The Arc of NEPA saw a fantastic opportunity to add to Dr. King’s vision for a more inclusive world and reached out to the commission to plan a food drive for families in need. On January 16, 2017, The Arc of NEPA and the United Neighborhood Centers of Northeastern Pennsylvania co-led a food drive to benefit Angel’s Attic Food Bank. The food drive brought together participants from the United Neighborhood Centers and University of Scranton, volunteers from the Aktion Club, a community service group of adults with I/DD; and The Arc Responds, a group of employees from The Arc NEPA who raise funds to help people in the community. After the Martin Luther King, Jr. weekend, Aktion club members became part of the regular volunteer corps at Angel’s Attic Food Bank, sorting and delivering food two to three times each week. Their efforts were much appreciated in a community where hunger is a significant problem— nearly 22.1% of Scranton families live in poverty according to 2016 US Census data . The Aktion Club is truly helping to make The Arc NEPA a name in giving back . To help spread the name further, the chapter has also created public service announcements for its NEPA Gives Back Campaign to show how people with I/DD and The Arc NEPA contributes to their neighborhood. One PSA features the Angel’s Attic volunteers and the good work they do in their community. In time, we hope that The Arc of NEPA’s name will become as common in Scranton as “Dunder Mifflin.”. For more on inclusive volunteering and how disability organizations can build partnerships that serve community needs and strengthen The Arc’s presence in the community, visit http://www.thearc.org/inclusive-volunteering . *In 2015, The Arc was selected by the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) , the federal agency that leads the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service , to plan and execute volunteer projects that unite Americans in service for the MLK Day of Service and throughout the year. To date, 16 chapters of The Arc around the country have organized inclusive volunteer service projects where people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) volunteer alongside people without disabilities to provide food to people in their communities who are in need. In total, these projects have brought together over 1,000 volunteers to serve more than 14,000 people in need. Posted in Programs and Supports |.

Washington, DC – Earlier this month, the President’s Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities (PCPID) released the 2017 report “ America’s Direct Support Workforce Crisis: Effects on People with Intellectual Disabilities, Families, Communities and the U.S. Economy ”. The Arc released the following statement in response to the report:. “Direct support professionals play a vital role in the lives of people with intellectual disability and their families, yet as this report outlines, we are facing a crisis when it comes to recruitment and retention in this essential field. These highly skilled workers allow many individuals with intellectual disability to live, work, and learn in the community and lead self-directed lives. But increasingly, our community is losing these vital workers to higher-paying, less demanding jobs where proper training and competitive benefits are provided. “Nationally the shortage of direct support professionals is a priority initiative for The Arc and our chapter network. We are grateful that this report not only sheds light on this growing epidemic but also offers tangible solutions to the Trump Administration. As this crisis continues, individuals with intellectual disability and their families face uncertainty and anxiety. The Arc and our chapter network remain a resource as we work to address this crisis nationally, but we encourage prompt and immediate action,” said Peter V. Berns, CEO of The Arc and member of PCPID. The Arc’s Direct Support Professional (DSP) Toolkit is highlighted in the report. The toolkit was created to support chapters of The Arc with DSP retention and recruitment. This tool was developed and used in pilot demonstrations conducted by the Research and Training Center on Community Living at the University of Minnesota.

The Arc Responds to House Passage of the Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Education and Reform Act. Posted on February 15, 2018 by The Arc. Washington, DC – Today, the House of Representatives passed HR 620, the Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Education and Reform Act, a bill that would create additional requirements for filing lawsuits under the ADA. The Arc released the following statement in response to the passage of the bill:. “Individuals with disabilities have faced decades of discrimination, abuse, segregation, and neglect which the ADA was designed to help counter. This sham of a bill weakens the civil rights protections people with disabilities rely on and undermines the opportunities for inclusion made possible by the ADA. The disregard that the authors and supporters of this bill have shown for people with disabilities is an assault on civil rights and an attack on citizens with disabilities. “Our nation leads the world in respecting and valuing the lives of people with disabilities, fighting tirelessly to promote their rights through landmark legislation like the ADA. This bill is the first step in a dangerous direction and it is unknown where it may lead us. To erase decades of progress is a shameful betrayal of our nation’s values. While there is not a Senate version of this bill yet, we call on our Senators to do the right thing and oppose any attempts to roll back the protections of the ADA. They are our last line of defense against this attack on the civil rights of individuals with disabilities in America,” said Peter Berns, CEO of The Arc. If HR 620 becomes law, a person with a disability who is denied access to a business would have to send a letter notifying the business that it is inaccessible and out of compliance with the ADA. The business would then have 60 days to respond and 120 days to make “substantial progress” toward fixing the problem. Only if the business failed to acknowledge the notification or make substantial progress in fixing the violation, could the business be sued. This shift in responsibility for a law that has been on the books for more than 27 years is unacceptable. Complicating and lengthening the notification requirement, thereby restricting the rights of all people with disabilities to have the ADA enforced, further delays their access to and participation in their communities. HR 620 was drafted in response to concerns about a small number of individuals who have filed ADA lawsuits for financial gain. It is important to note, however, that no monetary damages are available under the ADA; rather, damages are provided under state laws. Thus, HR 620 simply does not solve the problem it is intended to address. It’s only real impact is to dissuade and delay people with disabilities from enforcing their right to be free from discrimination. Excessive lawsuits filed for attorney fees should be addressed through other means aimed at the unscrupulous attorneys involved, not by diminishing the rights of people with disabilities.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4620051343050613886/About-You-Dont-Say	"You Don’t Say…. July 2014. This blog is about how our Angelman Syndrome (AS), daughter is finding her voice. Jessie is using a brilliant AAC App called Speak for Yourself (SFY). Little did we know at the time how SFY would change the path of her life. Communication is the motivator for so many things. Unfortunately, during the early years, Jessie’s body failed her and seizures were a major interruption. Even though we could see the light was bright in her eyes, we were held at arm’s length due to the effects of Angelman Syndrome. Her educational path was one long plateau. At the beginning of every school year, I would explain to the new teacher that Jess’s receptive language was good, and to please treat her accordingly. Nearly all of her teachers had the same forced smile, glassy-eyed look when we shared insights about our daughter. By the time Back to School night arrived, the teacher had a completely different demeanor and would excitedly tell us how much Jessie understands! My response was “you don’t say!”. Why is it that we quickly judge people based on their package? Unfortunately, Jess learned how to manipulate people. She understood how things should work, but she couldn’t get her body to cooperate. She learned it was easier, as well as amusing, to manage people’s expectations of her. At the time, she couldn’t even isolate a finger or say a word. Of course, all of this has changed. Paperwork, it never ends; Jessie as Snow White and our little cowgirl. We have been fortunate to find professionals that have taken a personal interest in Jess. We learned that just because she failed at something didn’t mean the door was closed. It just meant we needed to give it time and try again. We also learned that just because you do everything “right” doesn’t mean you get the result you want. The most important thing we learned was to not give up. You can’t find a new path if you start off feeling defeated. Finally, doctors and teachers can only tell you what they presently see. No one could have predicted the path that she is on now. She has a long way to go, but this is a marathon, not a sprint. Now that you are here and if you want to read a little more, this will take you to some of my favorite posts."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4604757898073499813/You-Don't-Say	"Time for tea. October 17, 2017 by Mary1991. One morning last week, we were in a rush. The alarm didn’t go off and we overslept. Like a drill sergeant, I barked “hurry, let’s go, now!”. Within fourteen minutes flat, Jess ate and got dressed with barely a minute to spare before her ride arrived. She didn’t have enough time to tell me what she wanted for breakfast and we didn’t talk about our plans for the rest of the day. As I waved goodbye, I realized I was still wearing part of my jams. Even though mornings like this rarely happen, it makes me feel bad. In my opinion, lack of time is the number one reason for communication breakdowns. We can spend hours modeling language but if they feel pressure due to lack of time, then don’t be surprised when not much is said. Jess has learned to compensate by speaking in a holophrastic manner, using single words to express herself rather than a full phrase. Sometimes her opinion is stated in an emphatic “yes, yes, yes”, but mostly she interjects adjectives such as, “exceptional, ridiculous, rude”. This method is effective when she is with multiple people. Jess has also learned that one word can be used as an icebreaker. For example, she tapped the word “conversation”, then looked at Dad. She decided it was time they should talk, and they did. All it took was one word to get his attention and all it takes is one word to get her on a roll. At home, we encourage Jess to expand her sentences. A single word is not enough, especially if she is requesting something. The rule is, if it’s not in a sentence and if she isn’t specific, then the answer is no. Sounds harsh, but the bar needed to be raised. After imposing our demands, Jess said, “attention you, cookie, more Graham crackers.”. I love it when she uses words in a different way. Even though she lacks proper grammar in this example, she used “attention” in a way that she hadn’t before. Too often, people look too closely at what an AAC user says and forgets (or doesn’t appreciate the importance) that they need to practice playing with their voice. It doesn’t matter that she said this incorrectly because we have seen her self-correct over time. We are at the stage where we need to revisit how to have a polite conversation. Typical talkers (those that don’t use an AAC device) learn to ask, “how are you?”, “I am fine, how are you?”. We have never taught Jess to use a script, however, I think she’s ready. I don’t expect her to carry a conversation (not now, not yet) but I do expect her to be part of one. Maybe it would be helpful to have an afternoon tea? Jess would enjoy having scones and biscuits with polite conversation. She can practice proper etiquette by not holding her pinky out. Yes, this is what we will do. If this goes well, she may want to send invites? Stay tuned. Filed Under: AAC , Now we are talking , Speak for Yourself. AAC- Pay it Forward. October 5, 2017 by Mary1991. Every month has a holiday associated with it. New Year’s, we wipe the slate clean. June is for brides, graduations and the start of summer. Then there is October, which is AAC awareness month. Fooled ya. Betcha thought I was going to say Halloween! I’m not afraid of spooks but I am afraid that people don’t know what AAC is. Over the course of Jessie’s day, she sees only one other person using an AAC device (we call it her Talker). Imagine going to the market, a party or to work and no one expressed themselves or talked the way you did? Jess isn’t speaking a foreign language but she might as well be when she talks through her AAC device. This is why awareness is so vital. Half our problem is that people don’t know what AAC is much less it’s many forms. The other half is the assumptions people make. For example, yesterday Jess and I were at a planning committee meeting. She saw a plate of cookies and asked for some using her Talker. Fine. No problem. Then she smiled at the lady sitting next to her and did her version of shaking hands resulting in the “oh aren’t you special” treatment (I mean this as no disrespect because Jess does present herself this way. It’s her way of working a crowd). As the meeting went on, I don’t recall if Jess was making a comment, or was exasperated by the first speaker monologing (there were five more departments sharing reports) when she tapped “ridiculous”. This caused three people in earshot to chuckle and they gave knowing glances. At that moment, the woman next to Jess did a double take, she was re-assessing Jess. I then asked Jess to put her Talker into whisper mode so she didn’t interrupt the meeting again. I’m pretty sure she was bored and wanted to change the subject. Whenever Jess goes anywhere, she wears her Talker. Every day she is exposing people to “her” voice. However, we need to do more. For AAC awareness month, our wish is for every family that uses a device (or any of AAC’s many forms) to Pay it Forward. Tell three friends and ask them to tell three friends. Explain that when they share that they are making our world bigger. I want AAC to be as commonly known as a phone. And if you are not an AAC family, I want you to pay it forward too. Here’s a sample script:. You: I just met a person that uses AAC. Them: What’s AAC? You: It’s augmentative and alternative communication. Them: What does that mean? You: Dude you are already using it… when you text on your phone, you are talking without speaking. Some people aren’t able to speak so they use a computer to talk for them. Even emoji’s are AAC. Actually, this script wasn’t made up. A few years ago we were having breakfast at IHOP. I overheard our waiter tell a co-worker how Jess ordered using an iPad. Even though we educate people every chance we get, there is more emphasis during October. I’m hoping that when people Pay it Forward we feel a ripple effect because awareness has been shared. Remember, knowledge is good! Friend or foe, Fox or friend. September 30, 2017 by Mary1991. Often I listen to Talk Radio while running errands. The other day, the host was wondering how news reporters can watch someone in a dire situation and not rush to aid. For a photographer, if they stop, they will lose their shot. Of course, there are times you can’t help and you can only witness. I have read about many who picked up their camera afterward and continued. They saved the day but lost the moment. This topic intrigued me. Turning the question around, asking what would I do? I’d like to think that I’d jump in to help but you won’t know till you are in the moment. The husband says, there are two types of people. Those that run towards an opportunity or away from a problem. However, there’s a third option, those that don’t react and do nothing. Later in the day. Jess and I went apple picking with friends. It was a beautiful day to walk in the orchard. The trees were heavy with fruit and it was easy pickings. It didn’t take long to fill our bags with apples. As we headed back, slowly meandering out, Jess was leading the way. She was about forty-two feet ahead of us ( I’m specific because I replayed this event in my mind. I’ve also walked enough courses for fences to know my stride.). Just after the bend in the dirt road, I glanced up at Jess and my heart stopped. There was a Red Fox jumping at her feet! Jess had a small bottle of bubbles in her right hand and she was holding it high above her head as if she were playing keep away. The fox seemed interested in what she had and was dancing around her. Instantly, I started running towards Jess yelling, “go, go, go…”. All I could do was make noise so the fox would move along. I sensed that Jess would want to reach down to pet him like she does when she is greeted by a dog. The thought that should could get bitten made me run faster. Fox tend to keep their distance from people. To be approached could mean he was sick but this one looked healthy. My guess is he lives in the orchard and has become comfortable with humans, maybe had been released after rehabilitation. Regardless, I reacted and didn’t think. While I was alarmed, my friends were not. Was this because it wasn’t their child, or was it because they didn’t grow up on a farm? Their laid-back nature made me feel like a drama queen. (found out later that one didn’t see and the other caught a glimpse, so this explains). We were a short walk back to the register (where we’d weigh and pay for the apples), Jess voiced her displeasure the whole way. Because I yelled, she thought she was in trouble and protested the unfairness all the way back to our car. She had been minding her own business, hadn’t done anything wrong, was not afraid of the fox and couldn’t understand why she had been wronged. Over and over I repeated why I was scared. I explained that whenever an animal shows unusual behavior, you need to be careful. It took us both awhile to calm down. Earlier this summer, the husband saw a Black Bear walking through our backyard. I griefed him about not taking a photo. Now I get it. I understand how he felt. Even though the bear was just passing through, it was unusual to see and he went into protection mode. It’s been a few days and I can still visualize the fox standing at Jess’s feet, his eyes turning to look at me before fox-trotting off. He did not understand why he was being yelled at. I’m sure he too felt he did nothing wrong. It’s human nature to fear what we don’t understand. Not till I had shooed the fox did I say “damn, that would have been an awesome photo”. It’s ironic, after raising the “what would I do” question that I was tested. I guess the answer depends on what your element is. I may not have street smarts but have lived on farms, This is my comfort zone. I love knowing that Jess is an animal whisperer. It’s one of her gifts. Animals sense that she will not harm. Dog, cats, and horses are drawn to her, so why not foxes? It’s all beginning to make perfect sense. Filed Under: Now we are talking , Random reads. Bad choices make good stories. September 21, 2017 by Mary1991. Sometimes I can’t see the forest for the trees. When I watch Jess too closely, I often miss the big picture. I hate it when other people do this and I abhor it when I catch myself falling into this same trap. A couple of weeks ago, Jess had a day where she did not utter a word on her iPad. I gave her grief about her not making an effort. As it turns out, she wasn’t feeling well. Of course, no one wants to talk when they feel poorly. What annoys me most is that I didn’t allow her this option and I jumped to conclusions. I let fear take a front seat, allowing it to drive my emotions. That’s the thing about hindsight, it’s 20/20. Can’t tell you how many times I’ve assumed too much and needed to apologize to Jess. More often than not, I say, “Mommy was wrong”. How frustrating it must be for her to be misunderstood. How fortunate I am that she always forgives me. Thank goodness she doesn’t hold a grudge. Maybe I need to add the phrase “oh Mother” or my favorite “oh the humanity” so she can express the feeling of injustice? (I will ask her, maybe she will want to say both). Sometimes, Jess uses non-verbal ways when frustrated. Over the summer, as we were finishing breakfast, she reached over and made a grab for a plate of bacon. As she was lunging across the table for the food (Angelman parent’s, I know you know what I mean), our host caught her by the wrist. Before I could say anything, he turned to me and sternly said, “don’t say a word”. The first thing that swirled through my brain was disappointment. We didn’t make it through our visit without a scene. I never excuse bad behavior, however, I did try to make light of it and was shut down. In hindsight, no one asked Jess if she wanted seconds (this is where I failed). Unfortunately, it was painfully obvious that there was no tolerance at the table. This was a humiliating experience. I felt bullied because I know that the host would not have spoken to my husband this way. I felt bad for Jess because she acted out of frustration. After we left, I reminded Jess that she could have asked and then told her that we were all partly to blame. Regardless, this was not handled well. There is no excuse for bad manners/ bad behavior. Last night we had more non-verbal drama. Dinner was a two-course meal. We started with chili and then would have Chef salad. Jess saw the salad and objected to the chili. She smacked the table and left the room. So much for family unity. Within minutes, Jess returned and asked for salad on her Talker and all was well again. When she cleaned her plate, she asked for more salad. I’m not happy with how she expressed herself in the beginning, however, she pulled it together and we were all able to enjoy our meal. At dinner’s end, she said, “afterwards anybody want ice cream…eat remarkable ice cream…sprinkles”? We’ve been on a strict Whole30 diet for the last few weeks, so there has been no dessert. However, I was not going to refuse her after she made such a nice request. There wasn’t any ice cream in our freezer, one cone at our local drive-in costs as much as a half-gallon at the market, so we went to Shop-rite. Not only did I buy ice cream (which was on sale) but I picked up a bottle of sprinkles because Jess had been specific. When I was in line, I changed my mind, returned the sprinkles and purchased M&M’s instead. Back at home, I told Jess I didn’t get sprinkles. I bought M&M’s. Asked her if she was okay with this. The answer was an enthusiastic yes! Then I added the word “substituted” in her Talker. This is a typical day in our life. This is part of our Angelman journey. We are far from perfect, but we are trying to do the best we can. Honestly, I don’t know who is the grasshopper and who is the master. Learning never ends. especially when you learn from them. Filed Under: AAC , Now we are talking. Chasing dreams. September 9, 2017 by Mary1991. Over the summer, I had a bad case of writer’s block. I had nothing, nada, zilch. Looking for inspiration, I listened to a TED talk hoping to learn how writers found their spark. One lecture, had me mesmerized. Elizabeth Gilbert shared about poet Ruth Stone, how she “would run like hell home”, chased by a poem. She had to get to a piece of paper to write before the words thundered through her. If she didn’t write, it would be lost. [Read more…] about Chasing dreams. Filed Under: Distractible me , Random reads. Does she remember me? September 8, 2017 by Mary1991. Many times, we’ve been asked, “does she remember me?”. Why is it that when people realize Jess isn’t verbal, they assume she has a memory problem too? (They also presume she doesn’t understand but I’m not going to go into that now.). Over the weekend, Jess tapped “Grand Daddy” on her Talker. I asked, “can you find me his photo?”. Immediately, she got up, went to another room, returned with his picture. I can’t remember the last time Jess asked about my father. He passed twelve years ago, seven years before she got her AAC voice. Though I think of him often, I rarely talk about him. With so many years in between, it makes me wonder what else she thinks about? I don’t know what sparked her memory. Often when people ask about others, it’s because they want to know more. It makes me realize that I need to share family lore. I’ve been shortchanging her by keeping it to myself. Jess will be home soon. I’m going to tell her that her Grand Daddy grew up during the Great Depression. Will then have to explain to her what the Depression was. I’ll tell her when I was a pre-teen, he took me to the 1000 islands on a fishing trip. (I’d better get a map out). After spending the day on a small outboard motorboat, our guide took us to a tiny island, built a fire and cooked bacon, eggs and the fresh trout we caught. Even though these stories may interest her, she will probably want to hear about the times she spent with him. Photos will help tell the stories. And, of course, Jess needs to know that her Grand Daddy never stopped researching why she was unable to talk. His generation went to the library and Google hadn’t been invented yet. We didn’t find out Jess’s Angelman Diagnosis till two-months after he passed. While reminiscing, we will be modeling language and reinforcing motor-planning memory. Jess may not share all the details that she holds in her memory, but I assure you, when she sets her mind to something, it’s a steel trap. I’d better go, Jess and I have a lot to talk about.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4603247444824816944/You-Don't-Say	"Missed opportunities. March 14, 2018 by Mary1991. Jessie ordering using SFY. We have a saying in our house, don’t state the obvious. However, sometimes what is obvious is easily overlooked. As I was falling asleep last night, I replayed the day’s events and realized I had missed an opportunity. Because Jess isn’t as chatty at home as she is when we are out, the ice cream social was created. I don’t know which is more exciting for her, having ice cream or seeing Heidi, however, the combination is a magical combination. I wish I could say Jess had a bevy of friends, she doesn’t. It’s easy to assume that this is because she has Angelman Syndrome (AS) but on closer scrutiny, Jess is particular about who she wants to be with. She does gravitate towards other AS people but she has only met a few. Fortunately, Jess is content with quality, not quantity, and doesn’t need to be part of a crowd. One thing I know for sure is that Heidi is on her A-list. The staff at It’s Nutt’s know Jessie. Like all their patrons, they never rush her when she’s ordering. On this day, the restaurant was quieter than usual which makes it easier to hear Jessie’s Talker. photo courtesy Jessie Kay Exploring features of the 10. While waiting for the ice cream to be served (with all the toppings that she ordered), Jess saw Heidi’s new phone and didn’t hesitate to pick it up (only good friends allow others to touch their phone much less explore). Jess wasn’t interested in the apps but instead opened the photos. Somehow, she figured out how to create slideshows (I think they were of Heidi’s kids). After that, she started taking pictures and saw that she could change the filters (our phone doesn’t have this feature). Then she and Heidi played with Snapchat. All in all, it was a fun afternoon and we needed a winter distraction. Photo courtesy of Heidi LoStracco. One of the biggest challenges being an AAC user is not being able to talk to other people who use a Talker. In this sense, Jess is always the odd man out. This is when I realized that we missed an obvious opportunity. There is no reason why I can’t bring my Talker and Heidi is always packing. As important as modeling language is, it’s just as important for us all to converse with our Talkers because we can. Next time, we will. Just one more…I don’t like this photo of me but I do like the photos Jessie takes. Of course, these are just some of the unedited photos. At home, Jess uses her old iPad and an iPod. The larger iPhone 10 was easier for her to manipulate. Jess likes the artsy shots. Courtesy Jessie Kay. Filed Under: Now we are talking."
