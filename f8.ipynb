    "  * 1100 documents uploaded, of which 8 test questions were made. These are used  to establish workers' trustworthiness. However, it was hard to find documents that contained AMs, since they are so sparsely distributed. I didn't count how many documents I checked, but I'd say it was around 100 to find 7 documents that contained an AM.\n",
    "  * 569 trusted judgments obtained in about 3 hours at $96.60, covering 7.9% of the data at 3 judments per document. (Some of the judgment    s were used on test questions, so 87 reports that were not test questions were actually annotated.) \n",

    "  * For 22 documents, we received annotations (that's 14 new ones and 8 on the test questions)"

Editorial : http://annals . 7326 / M18 - 3527 . URLs go live when the embargo lifts . Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year . Widespread screening would only be cost-effective in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico and never in the 50 states . Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted . However , the authors note that many other considerations should inform blood safety policies in addition to cost-effectiveness .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

Ended up doing a methylprednisolone infusion for that . I think I've been rather lucky with my symptoms to date ( some fatigue , weakness , headaches , back pain , tingling hands ) . My most frustrating symptoms lately have been headaches and the MS Hug . But nothing keeps me from working and still staying active . I have a great support system at home , but even til today I still have some trouble talking about it with everyone because it's tough for others to totally understand everything I deal with . I was hoping to find some people on here around my age who are also dealing with MS to chat with . I could use some friends who are at the same point in their lives who are also fighting the good fight against MS . Or if anyone lives in the Buffalo , NY area , you can message me too . It's interesting to hear the experiences people have had with doctors in my area . PM me a message if you want to chat !</td>\n",

       "      <td>August 27 , 2018 by Mary 1991 4 Comments . For most of Jessie's years , we didn't know any Angel parents . We were on our own to reinvent the wheel , navigating seizures , and sleep disturbances . Even though we heard a few words and phrases , upon learning of her Angleman diagnosis ( when she was 13 ) , I let go of the hope that Jess would talk in a traditional way . I wish I had someone that I could have shared with that understood . Earlier this week , I met with the only local Angel mom I know . We met by chance at a dance . Ashley was a chaperone . As soon as she saw Jessie , she suspected she was an Angel because she has one too . She made it her mission to meet the rest of the family before Jess left that night . Even though our children are different ages and stages , this hasn't prevented us from appreciating each other's perspective . Unfortunately , we don't get to visit that often , but when we do , we talk about anything and everything and of course , all things Angel . We all don't have the luxury of being with an Angelman mom / dad but we all can find a cyber one . I don't know if this will work but with two other Angel parents , we have just started a new Facebook group , Angelman Syndrome-Find a Buddy . ( for lack of better name ) . This is not another chat group . The sole purpose is to find another parent to connect to on a more personal level so we can reduce that feeling of being isolated . Every day , I read a parent announce they just were given a diagnosis . Others feel isolated because their needs are different from families who have typical children . Even when we were part of playgroups , I ended up being with Jess while the other mom's got to talk because Jess needed my support . Eventually , the divide grows wider as their children meet milestones at a much faster rate . For other parents with older children , their friends become empty nesters . Going out as couples became awkward because they don't want your third wheel . Believe me , I understand wanting a child-free zone and the luxury of being with just adults , however , we rarely get to do that . My new motto is , “ If you are an Angelman parent and don't know another Angelman parent , then get one ” ! Why specifically an Angelman parent ? Because firsthand experience means you don't have to explain yourself . Sharing common interests is integral to any friendship and this opportunity could be the beginning of beautiful friendships ! Some of you may already have your Angel-supports in place but maybe you could be a mentor to a young family ? Maybe you or someone you know was recently diagnosed and want to invite them to this group ? Or maybe you want to be part of the “ 3 am ” club because your kid has you up all night . This venue would allow you to find others “ awake ” at the same time . There might be a better forum to use than FB in that it could be set up in a more efficient way , however , this is what we have to work with . To begin , Join , Angelman Syndrome-Find a Buddy . Then add a brief post about yourself and what kind of support you would like to find . Maybe you are searching for one parent or maybe you want to form a group ( of three or four ) , or maybe you want to find someone where you check in once a week to see how they are doing ? ( You might find that you are FB friends already so this would be an opportunity to get to know them better ) . These are just suggestions . It's up to you to decide how to proceed . I don't know if this will work but I do know that Angelman parents are a very loving and supportive community . I've been blessed to make connections with families from around the world . Having friends in multiple time zones has been awesome ! This week , we will be tagging our friends to join this group . I'm afraid we may duplicate requests , if we do , please don't be annoyed . Since this is the launch , there should be a period of time for this group to build before connecting . I'd like to suggest that Buddy finding begins on September 15 , 2018 . Either this will be a flash of brilliance or an epic fail . Even if only a few connections are made , I'll consider this a success , however , it could be so much more . This will only work if you are willing to play . I hope you do ! Filed Under : Now we are talking .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi all ive been reading a lot of your stories and posts and thought i would share . Im a 39 year old male , living in Ireland . I have been attending a neuro for 4 years under query of ms . I've had an mri done every year , spinal tap , bloods , nerve conduction study and all negative appart from a lesion at c3 that was present on an mri in 2015 but has subsequently shrunk and disappeared . Brain scans showed moderate brain atrophy in 2015 but that has also improved to be no notable atrophy this year . I have symptoms of numbness and tingling in legs and arms , bowel ( constipation and diarrhoea in one day ) and bladder problems , balance problems , my left foot feels like its in a boot all the time and my toes , hands and calf muscles spasm most days . Ive also lost feeling on my left leg around the ankle area . Im quite fit and run and exercise a good bit but theres days when i cant manage a flight of stairs . Recently after doing some gardening work , I lost power in my arms for about two weeks , unable to squeeze toothpaste or open a jar and after two weeks the power and feeling returned . If its cold out my hands and feet go numb almost immediately and I lose dexterity in them and the toes on my left foot go numb almost as soon as i start to walk or run . If its hot out , im sweating buckets and buzzing all over . Quite a lot going on but most of it is more of an annoyance and for the most part it doesnt stop me doing what I want to do but the sypmtoms im having keep seeing to increase and I'm picking up new ones as time goes on . The neurologist has diagnosed me with transverse myelitis and prescribed gabapentin and amyltripoline for the symptoms . Neither medication worked that well and when I bring this up with gp or Neuro they just increase the dosage which worked for a couple of weeks and then symptoms return . There seems to be a pattern to the symptoms in that they start to increase in severity over a period of a few weeks to the point where my whole body is buzzing and tingling , ill be unable to sleep for a couple of days and then it will slow down a bit but never really go away . Does anyone else on here have a similar diagnosis and do you have any idea of prognosis for the long or short term ? I have a hard time understanding how or why symptoms would appear new or get worse if the lesion has actually shrunk .</td>\n",

I don't know if this is a Man thing or an Apikoros 18 thing but ... As mentioned by me in other posts , I need an injection ( trimix ) to achieve an erection . I cannot masturbate anymore but I still look at adult material . I still look at women , and even more want to have PIV intimacy with my wife . BUT , it can never be spontaneous anymore and with a 9 year old with special needs , even finding the time is difficult , let alone all the prep work . ( 15 mins for the meds after you take them from the freezer , than the injection , than 15 mins to get an erection ) Even then sometimes the meds don't work . They degrade over time and at 175 / $ a vial , you want to make it last as long as possible ( No pun intended . OK , maybe a little ) The bottom line is I still feel horny , I still get arouse ( in my head ) but the frustration of not being able to act on it ... It hurts me as a man . Yes , I'm in therapy about it but it doesn't stop the thoughts and feelings , the self esteem issues etc . 6 . Related to # 5 , would it be weird to inject myself to jerk off ? I feel its weird but I work from home so I could without anyone being the wiser but it feels selfish and weird .

       "      <td>1 . Screening all donated blood for Zika virus is not cost-effective in the United States . Abstract : http://annals . org / aim / article / doi / 10 . 7326 / M18 - 2238 . Editorial : http://annals . 7326 / M18 - 3527 . URLs go live when the embargo lifts . Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year . Widespread screening would only be cost-effective in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico and never in the 50 states . Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted . However , the authors note that many other considerations should inform blood safety policies in addition to cost-effectiveness .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

       "      <td>1 . What do you use for focus / fatigue ? I'm back on Adderall ( which is awesome as I am also back on weight watchers so ... ) I was on Mofandil for a bit but health insurance approval was a bitch plus I didn't think was as good as Adderall 2 . Anyone else find essential oils with a diffuser helps with fatigue , negativity , and depression ? I do and I wanted to share and see if anyone has similar experiences or something they like better or is it psychosomatic ? If so , what scents do you find helpful ? 3 . Does anyone take nootropics ? I take [ these ] ( https://hvmn.com/nootrobox ) . I think they help , but again , psychosomatic ? Beats me 4 . I am an atheist but I am real into [ Discordianism ] ( http://discordia.wikia.com/wiki/Discordianism ) . As a 9/11 survivor who was DXed almost 3 months to the day after , well ... If I'm wrong and there is a God , when I get there she better get down on her knees and beg MY forgiveness . Do you find spirituality helps you ? What kind of things do you do for that sense of inner peace or at least feeling like the cross you bear isn't too heavy ? 5 . How do you deal with sexual issues ? I don't know if this is a Man thing or an Apikoros 18 thing but ... As mentioned by me in other posts , I need an injection ( trimix ) to achieve an erection . I cannot masturbate anymore but I still look at adult material . I still look at women , and even more want to have PIV intimacy with my wife . BUT , it can never be spontaneous anymore and with a 9 year old with special needs , even finding the time is difficult , let alone all the prep work . ( 15 mins for the meds after you take them from the freezer , than the injection , than 15 mins to get an erection ) Even then sometimes the meds don't work . They degrade over time and at 175 / $ a vial , you want to make it last as long as possible ( No pun intended . OK , maybe a little ) The bottom line is I still feel horny , I still get arouse ( in my head ) but the frustration of not being able to act on it ... It hurts me as a man . Yes , I'm in therapy about it but it doesn't stop the thoughts and feelings , the self esteem issues etc . 6 . Related to # 5 , would it be weird to inject myself to jerk off ? I feel its weird but I work from home so I could without anyone being the wiser but it feels selfish and weird . Anyway , that's just some stuff going on in my head as I approach year 16 of being diagnosed ( and year 2 , maybe 3 ) of being secondary progressive instead of RRMS .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi all ive been reading a lot of your stories and posts and thought i would share . Im a 39 year old male , living in Ireland . I have been attending a neuro for 4 years under query of ms . I've had an mri done every year , spinal tap , bloods , nerve conduction study and all negative appart from a lesion at c3 that was present on an mri in 2015 but has subsequently shrunk and disappeared . Brain scans showed moderate brain atrophy in 2015 but that has also improved to be no notable atrophy this year . I have symptoms of numbness and tingling in legs and arms , bowel ( constipation and diarrhoea in one day ) and bladder problems , balance problems , my left foot feels like its in a boot all the time and my toes , hands and calf muscles spasm most days . Ive also lost feeling on my left leg around the ankle area . Im quite fit and run and exercise a good bit but theres days when i cant manage a flight of stairs . Recently after doing some gardening work , I lost power in my arms for about two weeks , unable to squeeze toothpaste or open a jar and after two weeks the power and feeling returned . If its cold out my hands and feet go numb almost immediately and I lose dexterity in them and the toes on my left foot go numb almost as soon as i start to walk or run . If its hot out , im sweating buckets and buzzing all over . Quite a lot going on but most of it is more of an annoyance and for the most part it doesnt stop me doing what I want to do but the sypmtoms im having keep seeing to increase and I'm picking up new ones as time goes on . The neurologist has diagnosed me with transverse myelitis and prescribed gabapentin and amyltripoline for the symptoms . Neither medication worked that well and when I bring this up with gp or Neuro they just increase the dosage which worked for a couple of weeks and then symptoms return . There seems to be a pattern to the symptoms in that they start to increase in severity over a period of a few weeks to the point where my whole body is buzzing and tingling , ill be unable to sleep for a couple of days and then it will slow down a bit but never really go away . Does anyone else on here have a similar diagnosis and do you have any idea of prognosis for the long or short term ? I have a hard time understanding how or why symptoms would appear new or get worse if the lesion has actually shrunk .</td>\n",

I was diagnosed in 2005 , I was 44 working in The Middle East . In 2006 I returned to England to see a Neurology Professor , he could not confirm Parkinson's from his examination and so , he arranged a Dat Scan which confirmed that I do have Parkinson's . However , in 2013 I met with another Neurology Professor in Singapore , he rejected the Dat Scan findings and said that I did not have the disease but , he didn't say what I had . Again I returned to England and the Neurologist told me that I have YOPD ! I have only met 3-4 other Parkinson's victims , all were older than myself . Now it seems that I am experiencing \" on - off \" symptoms and do not know what to do about it . I am living in Indonesia where there are no support groups . cookies .   \n",
       "8   1 . Screening all donated blood for Zika virus is not cost-effective in the United States . Abstract : http://annals . org / aim / article / doi / 10 . 7326 / M18 - 2238 . Editorial : http://annals . 7326 / M18 - 3527 . URLs go live when the embargo lifts . Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year . Widespread screening would only be cost-effective in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico and never in the 50 states . Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted . However , the authors note that many other considerations should inform blood safety policies in addition to cost-effectiveness .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

I've been taking that since the beginning , with one flare-up a few years ago . Ended up doing a methylprednisolone infusion for that . I think I've been rather lucky with my symptoms to date ( some fatigue , weakness , headaches , back pain , tingling hands ) . My most frustrating symptoms lately have been headaches and the MS Hug . But nothing keeps me from working and still staying active . I have a great support system at home , but even til today I still have some trouble talking about it with everyone because it's tough for others to totally understand everything I deal with . I was hoping to find some people on here around my age who are also dealing with MS to chat with . I could use some friends who are at the same point in their lives who are also fighting the good fight against MS . Or if anyone lives in the Buffalo , NY area , you can message me too . It's interesting to hear the experiences people have had with doctors in my area . PM me a message if you want to chat !   \n",

For most of Jessie's years , we didn't know any Angel parents . We were on our own to reinvent the wheel , navigating seizures , and sleep disturbances . Even though we heard a few words and phrases , upon learning of her Angleman diagnosis ( when she was 13 ) , I let go of the hope that Jess would talk in a traditional way . I wish I had someone that I could have shared with that understood . Earlier this week , I met with the only local Angel mom I know . We met by chance at a dance . Ashley was a chaperone . As soon as she saw Jessie , she suspected she was an Angel because she has one too . She made it her mission to meet the rest of the family before Jess left that night . Even though our children are different ages and stages , this hasn't prevented us from appreciating each other's perspective . Unfortunately , we don't get to visit that often , but when we do , we talk about anything and everything and of course , all things Angel . We all don't have the luxury of being with an Angelman mom / dad but we all can find a cyber one . I don't know if this will work but with two other Angel parents , we have just started a new Facebook group , Angelman Syndrome-Find a Buddy . ( for lack of better name ) . This is not another chat group . The sole purpose is to find another parent to connect to on a more personal level so we can reduce that feeling of being isolated . Every day , I read a parent announce they just were given a diagnosis . Others feel isolated because their needs are different from families who have typical children . Even when we were part of playgroups , I ended up being with Jess while the other mom's got to talk because Jess needed my support . Eventually , the divide grows wider as their children meet milestones at a much faster rate . For other parents with older children , their friends become empty nesters . Going out as couples became awkward because they don't want your third wheel . Believe me , I understand wanting a child-free zone and the luxury of being with just adults , however , we rarely get to do that . My new motto is , “ If you are an Angelman parent and don't know another Angelman parent , then get one ” ! Why specifically an Angelman parent ? Because firsthand experience means you don't have to explain yourself . Sharing common interests is integral to any friendship and this opportunity could be the beginning of beautiful friendships ! Some of you may already have your Angel-supports in place but maybe you could be a mentor to a young family ? Maybe you or someone you know was recently diagnosed and want to invite them to this group ? Or maybe you want to be part of the “ 3 am ” club because your kid has you up all night . This venue would allow you to find others “ awake ” at the same time . There might be a better forum to use than FB in that it could be set up in a more efficient way , however , this is what we have to work with . To begin , Join , Angelman Syndrome-Find a Buddy . Then add a brief post about yourself and what kind of support you would like to find . Maybe you are searching for one parent or maybe you want to form a group ( of three or four ) , or maybe you want to find someone where you check in once a week to see how they are doing ? ( You might find that you are FB friends already so this would be an opportunity to get to know them better ) . These are just suggestions . It's up to you to decide how to proceed . I don't know if this will work but I do know that Angelman parents are a very loving and supportive community . I've been blessed to make connections with families from around the world . Having friends in multiple time zones has been awesome ! This week , we will be tagging our friends to join this group . I'm afraid we may duplicate requests , if we do , please don't be annoyed . Since this is the launch , there should be a period of time for this group to build before connecting . I'd like to suggest that Buddy finding begins on September 15 , 2018 . Either this will be a flash of brilliance or an epic fail . Even if only a few connections are made , I'll consider this a success , however , it could be so much more . This will only work if you are willing to play . I hope you do ! Filed Under : Now we are talking .   \n",

most simplest terms ? I was watching a University WebCast on MS and some neurologist / researcher mentioned that people with MS have high amounts of Autoantibodies and low amounts of Lymphocytes . He said this will be the next step in developing new medication . What does this all mean ( Autoantibodies ) ? ?   \n",

While not well known , this test can detect embryos destined to develop Angelman syndrome .

Im a 39 year old male , living in Ireland . I have been attending a neuro for 4 years under query of ms . I've had an mri done every year , spinal tap , bloods , nerve conduction study and all negative appart from a lesion at c3 that was present on an mri in 2015 but has subsequently shrunk and disappeared . Brain scans showed moderate brain atrophy in 2015 but that has also improved to be no notable atrophy this year . I have symptoms of numbness and tingling in legs and arms , bowel ( constipation and diarrhoea in one day ) and bladder problems , balance problems , my left foot feels like its in a boot all the time and my toes , hands and calf muscles spasm most days . Ive also lost feeling on my left leg around the ankle area . Im quite fit and run and exercise a good bit but theres days when i cant manage a flight of stairs . Recently after doing some gardening work , I lost power in my arms for about two weeks , unable to squeeze toothpaste or open a jar and after two weeks the power and feeling returned . If its cold out my hands and feet go numb almost immediately and I lose dexterity in them and the toes on my left foot go numb almost as soon as i start to walk or run . If its hot out , im sweating buckets and buzzing all over . Quite a lot going on but most of it is more of an annoyance and for the most part it doesnt stop me doing what I want to do but the sypmtoms im having keep seeing to increase and I'm picking up new ones as time goes on . The neurologist has diagnosed me with transverse myelitis and prescribed gabapentin and amyltripoline for the symptoms . Neither medication worked that well and when I bring this up with gp or Neuro they just increase the dosage which worked for a couple of weeks and then symptoms return . There seems to be a pattern to the symptoms in that they start to increase in severity over a period of a few weeks to the point where my whole body is buzzing and tingling , ill be unable to sleep for a couple of days and then it will slow down a bit but never really go away . Does anyone else on here have a similar diagnosis and do you have any idea of prognosis for the long or short term ? I have a hard time understanding how or why symptoms would appear new or get worse if the lesion has actually shrunk .   \n",

What do you use for focus / fatigue ? I'm back on Adderall ( which is awesome as I am also back on weight watchers so ... ) I was on Mofandil for a bit but health insurance approval was a bitch plus I didn't think was as good as Adderall 2 . Anyone else find essential oils with a diffuser helps with fatigue , negativity , and depression ? I do and I wanted to share and see if anyone has similar experiences or something they like better or is it psychosomatic ? If so , what scents do you find helpful ? 3 . Does anyone take nootropics ? I take [ these ] ( https://hvmn.com/nootrobox ) . I think they help , but again , psychosomatic ? Beats me 4 . I am an atheist but I am real into [ Discordianism ] ( http://discordia.wikia.com/wiki/Discordianism ) . As a 9/11 survivor who was DXed almost 3 months to the day after , well ... If I'm wrong and there is a God , when I get there she better get down on her knees and beg MY forgiveness . Do you find spirituality helps you ? What kind of things do you do for that sense of inner peace or at least feeling like the cross you bear isn't too heavy ? 5 . How do you deal with sexual issues ? I don't know if this is a Man thing or an Apikoros 18 thing but ... As mentioned by me in other posts , I need an injection ( trimix ) to achieve an erection . I cannot masturbate anymore but I still look at adult material . I still look at women , and even more want to have PIV intimacy with my wife . BUT , it can never be spontaneous anymore and with a 9 year old with special needs , even finding the time is difficult , let alone all the prep work . ( 15 mins for the meds after you take them from the freezer , than the injection , than 15 mins to get an erection ) Even then sometimes the meds don't work . They degrade over time and at 175 / $ a vial , you want to make it last as long as possible ( No pun intended . OK , maybe a little ) The bottom line is I still feel horny , I still get arouse ( in my head ) but the frustration of not being able to act on it ... It hurts me as a man . Yes , I'm in therapy about it but it doesn't stop the thoughts and feelings , the self esteem issues etc . 6 . Related to # 5 , would it be weird to inject myself to jerk off ? I feel its weird but I work from home so I could without anyone being the wiser but it feels selfish and weird . Anyway , that's just some stuff going on in my head as I approach year 16 of being diagnosed ( and year 2 , maybe 3 ) of being secondary progressive instead of RRMS .   \n",

                                                               I'm so sorry about your mom . I hope what I have is not that , I haven't found detailed info about lewy-body to understand it better and compare it with my symptoms , but from where I could gather it affects different parts of the brain and not just the sustancia nigra , and that could explain some of my symptoms , although I heard that PD patients have paresthesias as well , that's why I came here . Anyway I hope it's not that , take care .   \n",

Muscle builds because of stimulation inflicting sufficient pressure that the muscle is compelled to adapt and grow . typically that is achieved by means of lifting weights within a sure rep range . The maximum not unusual one used by bodybuilders is inside the 10-12 range for maximum muscle groups although larger stages along with 15-25 can be used for the legs and abs . Of route the most extreme weight lifting physical games involve isometrics , where the resistance is so great no motion takes area . not anything gets effects quicker and by the time you've got completed reading this newsletter you'll understand why .

My left eye wouldn't go all the way left so I was seeing double . Doctors said is was West Nile . Then 3 years later my whole left side head to toe went numb . I did another MRI and then Spinal Tap . Then I had a Spinal headache for 3 days . Then got the call saying I have MS . Both my mom and grandma started to cry . My mom said you are taking this better then I thought . I told I'm relieved . I'm not CRAZY . My grandma said \" not only did you get my name but you got my disease \" I told her \" its not like I'm dying in 6 weeks . Its just something I have to live with for the rest of my life . You can help me through it . To be honest I haven't had major moments I started Avonex right away and went in to remission in 2009 when I was pregnant and have been till now . I have a few symptoms but not bad ones . They last any from an hour to a few days . I'm hoping they stay that way . My biggest challenge is taking care of my two boys on my bad days . Lately I have be dizziness and pain . I would say to someone new to MS It doesn't define who you are , and don't let it control your life . You can control it . It maybe hard to do but you can do anything you set your mind to .   \n",

I was diagnosed in 2005 , I was 44 working in The Middle East . In 2006 I returned to England to see a Neurology Professor , he could not confirm Parkinson's from his examination and so , he arranged a Dat Scan which confirmed that I do have Parkinson's . However , in 2013 I met with another Neurology Professor in Singapore , he rejected the Dat Scan findings and said that I did not have the disease but , he didn't say what I had . Again I returned to England and the Neurologist told me that I have YOPD ! I have only met 3-4 other Parkinson's victims , all were older than myself . Now it seems that I am experiencing \" on - off \" symptoms and do not know what to do about it . I am living in Indonesia where there are no support groups . cookies .   \n",

at age 25 but immediately involved myself with Walk MS . I look forward to the event each year as it gives me something to foc us on during the difficult days . As a public school teacher my biggest challenges are avoiding the potential changes I will face not because I can't ghost and me them but because I don't want my students to have to face a similar daily uncertainty and inconsistency that I do - will my cognitive struggles embarrass and frustrate me or will I need a walking aid ? I worry about ant inconsistencies my condition brings into the classroom . my hopes and dreams are to stay active physically and mentally so some day my children will hear my stories of \" before the cure was found \" .   \n",

       "91  1 . Screening all donated blood for Zika virus is not cost-effective in the United States . Abstract : http://annals . org / aim / article / doi / 10 . 7326 / M18 - 2238 . Editorial : http://annals . 7326 / M18 - 3527 . URLs go live when the embargo lifts . Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus , which began in 2016 , was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year . Widespread screening would only be cost-effective in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico and never in the 50 states . Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date . Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness , such as Guillain-Barre syndrome , and potentially devastating birth defects , such as microcephaly , the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection . In 2016 , the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing ( ID-NAT ) of donated blood for Zika virus in U . S . states and territories . Universal screening is still required today , although mini-pool NAT ( MP-NAT ) is permitted as of July 2018 . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously . Researchers from Stanford University , Vitalant Research Institute , and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT , universal mini-pool NAT , and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states . The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients , sexual partners , and their infants to weight the cost / benefit of universal screening . They found that during the first year of testing , screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico , and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states . Because the Zika epidemic is largely over , screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis . These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted . However , the authors note that many other considerations should inform blood safety policies in addition to cost-effectiveness .

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome . 7326 / L18 - 0438 . Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs , suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness . Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment . A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae . Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness , so it is important to understand the root cause . Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center . Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts . Both participants developed Katayama syndrome , as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure , even in the absence of eggs . Based on an observation of the two participants , the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult . According to the authors , the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided , that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure , and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition .

What do you use for focus / fatigue ? I'm back on Adderall ( which is awesome as I am also back on weight watchers so ... ) I was on Mofandil for a bit but health insurance approval was a bitch plus I didn't think was as good as Adderall 2 . Anyone else find essential oils with a diffuser helps with fatigue , negativity , and depression ? I do and I wanted to share and see if anyone has similar experiences or something they like better or is it psychosomatic ? If so , what scents do you find helpful ? 3 . Does anyone take nootropics ? I take [ these ] ( https://hvmn.com/nootrobox ) . I think they help , but again , psychosomatic ? Beats me 4 . I am an atheist but I am real into [ Discordianism ] ( http://discordia.wikia.com/wiki/Discordianism ) . As a 9/11 survivor who was DXed almost 3 months to the day after , well ... If I'm wrong and there is a God , when I get there she better get down on her knees and beg MY forgiveness . Do you find spirituality helps you ? What kind of things do you do for that sense of inner peace or at least feeling like the cross you bear isn't too heavy ? 5 . How do you deal with sexual issues ? I don't know if this is a Man thing or an Apikoros 18 thing but ... As mentioned by me in other posts , I need an injection ( trimix ) to achieve an erection . I cannot masturbate anymore but I still look at adult material . I still look at women , and even more want to have PIV intimacy with my wife . BUT , it can never be spontaneous anymore and with a 9 year old with special needs , even finding the time is difficult , let alone all the prep work . ( 15 mins for the meds after you take them from the freezer , than the injection , than 15 mins to get an erection ) Even then sometimes the meds don't work . They degrade over time and at 175 / $ a vial , you want to make it last as long as possible ( No pun intended . OK , maybe a little ) The bottom line is I still feel horny , I still get arouse ( in my head ) but the frustration of not being able to act on it ... It hurts me as a man . Yes , I'm in therapy about it but it doesn't stop the thoughts and feelings , the self esteem issues etc . 6 . Related to # 5 , would it be weird to inject myself to jerk off ? I feel its weird but I work from home so I could without anyone being the wiser but it feels selfish and weird . Anyway , that's just some stuff going on in my head as I approach year 16 of being diagnosed ( and year 2 , maybe 3 ) of being secondary progressive instead of RRMS .   \n",

Im a 39 year old male , living in Ireland . I have been attending a neuro for 4 years under query of ms . I've had an mri done every year , spinal tap , bloods , nerve conduction study and all negative appart from a lesion at c3 that was present on an mri in 2015 but has subsequently shrunk and disappeared . Brain scans showed moderate brain atrophy in 2015 but that has also improved to be no notable atrophy this year . I have symptoms of numbness and tingling in legs and arms , bowel ( constipation and diarrhoea in one day ) and bladder problems , balance problems , my left foot feels like its in a boot all the time and my toes , hands and calf muscles spasm most days . Ive also lost feeling on my left leg around the ankle area . Im quite fit and run and exercise a good bit but theres days when i cant manage a flight of stairs . Recently after doing some gardening work , I lost power in my arms for about two weeks , unable to squeeze toothpaste or open a jar and after two weeks the power and feeling returned . If its cold out my hands and feet go numb almost immediately and I lose dexterity in them and the toes on my left foot go numb almost as soon as i start to walk or run . If its hot out , im sweating buckets and buzzing all over . Quite a lot going on but most of it is more of an annoyance and for the most part it doesnt stop me doing what I want to do but the sypmtoms im having keep seeing to increase and I'm picking up new ones as time goes on . The neurologist has diagnosed me with transverse myelitis and prescribed gabapentin and amyltripoline for the symptoms . Neither medication worked that well and when I bring this up with gp or Neuro they just increase the dosage which worked for a couple of weeks and then symptoms return . There seems to be a pattern to the symptoms in that they start to increase in severity over a period of a few weeks to the point where my whole body is buzzing and tingling , ill be unable to sleep for a couple of days and then it will slow down a bit but never really go away . Does anyone else on here have a similar diagnosis and do you have any idea of prognosis for the long or short term ? I have a hard time understanding how or why symptoms would appear new or get worse if the lesion has actually shrunk .   \n",
