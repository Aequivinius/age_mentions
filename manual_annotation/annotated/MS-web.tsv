medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4723496016533268047/FDA-approves-new-oral-drug-to-treat-relapsing-forms-of-multiple-sclerosis	"Reviewed by Kate Anderton, B.Sc. Mar 29 2019. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Mavenclad (cladribine) tablets to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults, to include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease. Mavenclad is not recommended for MS patients with clinically isolated syndrome. Because of its safety profile, the use of Mavenclad is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of MS. ""We are committed to supporting the development of safe and effective treatments for patients with multiple sclerosis,"" said Billy Dunn, M.D., director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""The approval of Mavenclad represents an additional option for patients who have tried another treatment without success."" MS is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communications between the brain and other parts of the body. Most people experience their first symptoms of MS between the ages of 20 and 40. MS is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults and occurs more frequently in women than in men. For most people, MS starts with a relapsing-remitting course, in which episodes of worsening function (relapses) are followed by recovery periods (remissions). These remissions may not be complete and may leave patients with some degree of residual disability. Many, but not all, patients with MS experience some degree of persistent disability that gradually worsens over time. In some patients, disability may progress independent of relapses, a process termed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). In the first few years of this process, many patients continue to experience relapses, a phase of the disease described as active SPMS. Active SPMS is one of the relapsing forms of MS, and drugs approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS can be used to treat active SPMS. The efficacy of Mavenclad was shown in a clinical trial in 1,326 patients with relapsing forms of MS who had least one relapse in the previous 12 months. Mavenclad significantly decreased the number of relapses experienced by these patients compared to placebo. Mavenclad also reduced the progression of disability compared to placebo. Mavenclad must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug's uses and risks. Mavenclad has a Boxed Warning for an increased risk of malignancy and fetal harm. Mavenclad is not to be used in patients with current malignancy. In patients with prior malignancy or with increased risk of malignancy, health care professionals should evaluate the benefits and risks of the use of Mavenclad on an individual patient basis. Health care professionals should follow standard cancer screening guidelines in patients treated with Mavenclad. The drug should not be used in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception during treatment and for six months after the course of therapy because of the potential for fetal harm. Mavenclad should be stopped if the patient becomes pregnant. Other warnings include the risk of decreased lymphocyte (white blood cell) counts; lymphocyte counts should be monitored before, during and after treatment. Mavenclad may increase the risk of infections; health care professionals should screen patients for infections and treatment with Mavenclad should be delayed if necessary. Mavenclad may cause hematologic toxicity and bone marrow suppression so health care professionals should measure a patient's complete blood counts before, during and after therapy. The drug has been associated with graft-versus-host-disease following blood transfusions with non-irradiated blood. Mavenclad may cause liver injury and treatment should be interrupted or discontinued, as appropriate, if clinically significant liver injury is suspected. The most common adverse reactions reported by patients receiving Mavenclad in the clinical trials include upper respiratory tract infections, headache and decreased lymphocyte counts. The FDA granted approval of Mavenclad to EMD Serono, Inc. Source:."	"1149,1166"	2	patient	"1233,1245"	2	patient																																																																																	
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4723292921028156705/Good-News-for-Those-Not-Fond-of-Time-in-an-MRI-Tube	"For people living with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, regularly scheduled trips into a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tube can range from long and boring to traumatic. Depending on your degree of disease activity, your lesion load, and the standard practice of your MS provider, you can expect MRI appointments every 6 to 24 months. Many if not most of our readers will know of the contrast agent gadolinium. It’s what is injected into our veins about halfway through the scans. Gadolinium shows where “leaks” in the blood-brain barrier are, causing MS lesions. You may have heard or read of gadolinium as “ contrast .” Contrast agents like gadolinium make certain structures or tissues in the body appear different on the MRI images so they are more visible to your physician. For a number of years there has been concern about the heavy metal deposits gadolinium may leave in our brains . A new study, published in March 2019 in the journal Radiology , suggested that the use of gadolinium enhancement may not be needed to get images that are good enough to gauge MS progression. Side Benefits of No Gadolinium in the MRI. Although health concerns may have been a factor in calling for the study , I think the side benefits of this change will be of great importance to people with MS as well. First, of course, possible complications of repeated gadolinium exposure would be reduced. But, as I stated, most of us will know gadolinium from the injection halfway through the scan. The time in the noisy tube could be significantly reduced. Less time in the machine would mean that follow-up scans should be less costly. The psychological toll these scans take on those of us who find the cramped scanners claustrophobic cannot be underestimated either. I know some people with MS who require mild sedation to make it through these procedures. The Findings Only Apply to 3T MRI Scanners. I noted in the study that 3T machines were used in the research. If your clinic uses a 1.5T machine (the number references strength of the magnets used), the research wouldn’t apply. With 1.5T still the standard technology for MRI scanners, I know it took me some time to find a 3T machine where I live (and it’ll be a five-hour drive the next time I need a scan). So not everyone will be able to benefit from this new finding. As always, have a detailed conversation with your MS healthcare team (and your care partners) when it comes to deciding if gadolinium contrast can be skipped in your next scan. The jury is still out as to what harm long-term exposure to gadolinium might cause. So weighing risk to benefit will be an important discussion. Wishing you and your family the best of health.

Thursday March 28 2019 08:51 AM. This week Teresa McShane shares her mixed emotions about being a mum with MS and how she really feels about Mother's Day 2019. I never really imagined being a Mother. As a girl growing up, I can't remember ever having had that thought in my mind. It wasn't on my radar. It wasn't until I was diagnosed with MS in 1994 that I had to ask the question, ‘What about kids?' Thankfully, my fears were allayed when I was told there was no reason why I couldn't or shouldn't have children. So, fast forward 25 years and here I am with two wonderful boys, 15 and 13 and Mother's Day 2019 is just around the corner. Shelves with gift suggestions are neatly styled and stocked with goodies for ‘that special day'. Grand displays of floral-designed cards suggest I am a ‘Wonderful Mum', ‘A Mum in a Million' or, could I actually be ‘THE World's Best Mum EVER'? Well, on the one side, I'm not really ‘a card person'. And I am hugely cynical about the massive marketing and emotional blackmail involved in all these ‘significant' dates in the calendar. But once a year, it is good for families to take stock of all the things that their Mums do. And Mums do do a lot. Having said that, I don't think Mums keep a record, a tally of their daily chores because that's what we signed up to. That was the deal. Occasionally I acknowledge the fact that having MS has made my job as a mum more challenging. Mums with MS still have to do everything that other Mum's without MS do. We still have to do shopping, washing, cooking, and homework, tend to wounds, allay fears and wipe away tears. Be up to speed on training schedules, matches and play dates. Keep a house. Not to mention know where the other football sock or gum shield or left shoe is! It's exhausting on top of exhaustion. Thinking about it now, no wonder I have brain fog! And as a Mum with MS I can't help but judge myself for my failings. I get frustrated at the fact that my kids sometimes miss out on things because I can't do them or take them so there can be a huge reliance on partners, friends and family to fill in the gaps. I am lucky to have that support around me. My kids have grown up with these limitations but I hope they know that as their Mum I have always tried to do my best for them. So, on that note, I will accept the flowery card for the afternoons I tried to play ball in the garden with my son and fell over in the flowerbeds. I will accept the breakfast in bed for the nights I tended to my sick child when the fatigue was like a corn mill bearing down on top of me. And I will gladly sit back and read the Sunday paper for the mornings I stared up the staircase with a laundry basket in my hand feeling like I was about to attempt Everest. But I also acknowledge the greatest gift of all for me on Sunday 31st March is that I am blessed to be a Mum. Author: Teresa McShane."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4724107279886228431/What-Is-Secondary-Progressive-Multiple-Sclerosis?	"March 28, 2019. If your doctor says you have secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), it means you're in a different stage of your disease. Most folks get it after living for a while with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). In SPMS, you may not get any break in your symptoms, unlike RRMS, when you had flare-ups that came and went. But your doctor can suggest medicine to help manage them. Secondary vs. Relapsing-Remitting MS. About 85% of people with MS start with the relapsing-remitting form. They get attacks of symptoms called relapses, followed by symptom-free periods called remissions. During relapses, your immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- causes inflammation that damages the protective coating around nerve fibers. This disrupts the flow of nerve signals to and from the brain and spinal cord. It leads to symptoms like tiredness, numbness, and weakness. Then the immune system stops attacking. Your symptoms improve or disappear, and you go into remission. Relapses and remissions alternate over time. In SPMS, your symptoms steadily get worse instead of coming and going. You might still have relapses, but they don't happen as often. What Causes SPMS? It's not clear exactly why RRMS changes to SPMS. Some researchers think it happens because of nerve damage that occurred earlier in the disease. Not everyone with the relapsing-remitting form of the disease will get SPMS. Doctors don't know for sure who will and who won't, and how quickly it will happen. You're more likely to change to SPMS if:. When Do People Change to SPMS? A small number of people start out with SPMS. They may have had RRMS first, but it wasn't diagnosed or their symptoms were too mild to notice. Before disease-modifying drugs were available, half of people with RRMS changed to SPMS within 10 years. New treatments have altered the course of MS. Today these drugs can slow MS and delay the move towards SPMS, although doctors don't know how much they delay it. What to Expect.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4722117989345551941/is-a-spinal-tap-needed-to-diagnose-MS?---Multiple-Sclerosis---MedHelp	"is a spinal tap needed to diagnose MS? - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp. Hi, and welcome to the MS Forum. I hope we can help with some of your questions. The main ?? is whether or not a spinal tap is needed for a diagnosis of MS. the easy answer is ""no"", but that doesn't tell the whole story. There is no requirement in all of the criteria for diagnosing MS that one must have an LP (Lumbar Puncture or spinal tap). However, a tap may be very useful to add evidence to the picture that MS might be responsible for a person's problems IF it is positive (for O-Bands or for an elevated IgG Index). Where many neurologists become confused in what to think if the LP is negative. If it is negative IT DOES NOT RULE OUT MS. Again, it is incorrect to rule out MS as the diagnosis if the LP is negative. When you say you had R-sided pain, did you mean in your abdomen? Did the GI work up rule out Celiac Disease? This can be an elusive thing to find and can cause neurologic symptoms. I also assume you had blood tests for ESR, ANA, B12, Lyme Disease, HIV, VDRL, ACE, Anti-Phospholipid and anti-cardiolipin, plus several more? The process of diagnosing MS goes something like this:. 1) The neurologist looks for a pattern of symptoms where first there is an onset of symptoms consistent with demyelination in the central nervous system. The most common demyelinating disease is, by far, MS. They look for repeated attacks, which after time improve or go away. Then, for any subsequent attack. If they have this Attack-Improvement or Relapse-Remitting pattern the suspicion for MS rises. If there is only one attack, they can be suspicious, but they will want much more evidence. 2) The next thing that is required is a completely thorough, head-to-toe neuro exam and they look for evidence of damage to the central nervous system (CNS) in two or more places. Do you have any abnormalities on your exam - like hyperactive reflexes,abnormal eye exam, altered sensation (especially from one side to the other), and such? This would include the new tremor in your thumb. 3) Usually the next thing would be an MRI of the brain and, many experts believe that an MRI of the spine should be included - the cervical spinal cord at least. If the MRI is abnormal in a way that is consistent with MS, then with the pattern of two or more attacks and two or more distinct places in the CNS, then there is actually enough information to diagnose MS --->>. 4) IF all the other things known to cause neurologic problems like this are ruled out, like autoimmune diseases, Vit12 deficiency, infections, cancer, and such. MS cannot be diagnosed until a full ""rule-out"" has been done. Most of this is by blood work. Now, MS also frequently causes lesions in the spinal cord. If your neurologist wants to do an LP because he needs more evidence, it would make most sense to do the spinal cord MRI next because it can supply the needed evidence to make the diagnosis sometimes and it is recommended to do this if the evidence from the history and physical and the brain MRI are not enough. Also, since you have had visual problems, it makes sense to have you be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist to be work up for optic neuritis. This would typically be done by first an eye exam. If the eye exam showed signs of optic neuritis such as paleness of the optic disc at the back of the eye (when they look deep inside) or by defects in your visual field, then this is another big piece of info that would point toward MS and make an LP less necessary. If the eye exam was normal, you still could have had optic neuritis, because the exam is normal in 64% of people who have had optic neuritis. Then you would want to have a VEP - Visual Evoked Potential - to look for the signs of optic neuritis in another way. So, two tests that you didn't mention would be the spinal cord MRI and a VEP to look for more evidence of MS. If those didn't provide the evidence needed for a diagnosis, then a spinal tap (LP) would be recommended. Now, some neurologists insist on an LP for everyone, but that is not actually required. Do you have the report of the MRI? This can be useful to have to see exactly what they said about the lesions in the white matter. Foci = spots, or lesions. Too many neurologists expect the MRI to be absolutely classic for MS, when all it has to be is consistent. Now, I have a couple more questions. What was your pattern of symptoms as they developed? Have any improved? Did you have any period where things seemed better? What was your neuro exam like? Was your ESR elevated? Have you had any joint pain or arthritis? Well, I have gone on and on. The main point here is that MS is a little sticky to diagnose. The docs have to look at a lot of things and their patterns. And, there may be a couple more non-invasive things to do before an LP is necessary. However, I would advise you to have the LP if the doc really needs the evidence. I hope this helps. I am one of the forum's co-leaders and before being disabled by MS I practiced medicine for 23 years. Others will be by soon to add their hello's and advice and support.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702815046749225822/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	"My journey began in November 2009. I had been having a lot of aches and stiffness in my neck one day during work. When I got home, I took an anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxer, took a hot shower, and went to bed. The next morning, I felt drunk. I almost fell down my stairs, and could not walk straight. I was embarrassed when I stopped at the gas station, because I was stumbling everywhere on the sidewalk walking to my car, I knew people were looking at me. By the time I got to work that morning, I knew something was not right with me. My co-workers agreed something wasn't right, and someone drove me to the hospital. As I sat in the exam room in the ER, I just figured I was having some kind of reaction to the medication I had taken for my neck the night before. The doctor ordered a CAT scan and ran some lab work. I will never forget those moments that followed. The doctor came into the room after I had my tests done. He shut the door behind him, walked over to me carrying my file, and he sat down on the table next to me. He said, ""I don't have good news. There appears to be lesions on your brain and spinal cord. More than likely, you have Multiple Sclerosis."" At that time, I didn't know what MS was. I was terrified. This was my life-changing moment. I went and saw a neurologist a week later. He ordered an MRI and spinal tap. Diagnosis of RRMS confirmed: November 2009, Age 22. I was put on Copaxone and Solu-Medrol IV treatments right away. The steroids helped tremendously. I continued the Copaxone up until last year, I couldn't stand the pain every night anymore. So, I am hoping to start a different form of treatment in the near future."

Tuesday March 26 2019 10:00 AM. Last year I took on the challenge of the VHI Women’s Mini Marathon for Multiple Sclerosis Ireland and I can’t wait to take part again this year. I was diagnosed with MS in 2016, age 26. I went to bed one night, followed my normal bedtime routine and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The next day I woke up and I experienced my first MS attack; my whole life changed in an instant. I couldn’t control my body movements. I was paralyzed down the left side of my body and it wouldn’t move the way I wanted it to. It would even make strange movements without my permission. Long story short, I had lesions on the part of my brain that controls my voluntary body movements. This impacted my mobility and I was quickly diagnosed with MS. When you go from being healthy one day and waking up the next not being able to move your body properly, you really do re-evaluate everything. I have experienced what it’s like to lose something that I took for granted, like walking across the room or walking down the street; now I try to make sure I never take anything for granted again. I face challenges with my MS on a daily basis. Fatigue is a big symptom and it can get in the way of training and exercising. Even at the Mini Marathon you can face struggles, especially on a warm day. Last year I saw a women taking part in the Mini Marathon in full army gear. I told my friends that’s what MS is like for me! You feel like you have weights attached to your arms and legs, and I carry that around with me everywhere! Taking part in the Mini Marathon means a lot of different things to me. It makes me feel proud of myself and is a way for me to celebrate my ability to be lucky enough to jog it. I am in remission, so I will make the most of it and that’s why I love taking part. I am not wasting the opportunity because one day I may not be given that luxury. I focus on the here and now, and now I am doing well, so I will jog it and if I can’t jog it, I will walk it!! The VHI Women’s Mini Marathon can be tough and of course there are struggles, but I can’t even describe how rewarding, proud, emotional and happy you feel when you have completed the race. I cannot wait to do it again for MS Ireland this year, to represent all my fellow MSer’s and stand alongside all the other women ready to begin the race for a charity they hold close to their hearts. It really is a beautiful feeling. To join Christina and Team MS Ireland sign up today by visiting. Get in touch.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4722811806552853751/What-is-the-Modified-Fatigue-Impact-Scale?	"The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) is a tool that doctors use to evaluate how fatigue affects someone’s life. Fatigue is a common and often frustrating symptom for up to 80 percent of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) . Some people with MS find it hard to accurately describe their MS-related fatigue to their doctor. Others have difficulty communicating the full effect that fatigue has on their daily life. The MFIS involves answering or evaluating a series of questions or statements about your physical, cognitive, and psychosocial health. It’s a quick process that can go a long way toward helping your doctor fully understand how fatigue affects you. This makes it easier to come up with an effective plan for managing it. Read on to learn more about the MFIS, including the questions it covers and how it’s scored. How is the test administered? The MFIS is generally presented as a 21-item questionnaire, but there’s also a 5-question version. Most people fill it out on their own in a doctor’s office. Expect to spend anywhere from five to ten minutes circling your answers. If you have vision problems or trouble writing, ask to go through the questionnaire orally. Your doctor or someone else in the office can read off the questions and note your answers. Don’t hesitate to ask for clarification if you don’t fully understand any of the questions. What are the questions? Simply saying you’re fatigued usually doesn’t convey the reality of how you’re feeling. That’s why the MFIS questionnaire addresses several aspects of your daily life to paint a more complete picture. Some of the statements focus on physical abilities:. * I have been clumsy and uncoordinated. * My muscles feel weak . Some statements address cognitive matters, such as memory, concentration, and decision-making:. Other statements reflect psychosocial aspects of your health, which refers to your moods, feelings, relationships, and coping strategies. Examples include:. * I have been less motivated to participate in social activities . You can find the full list of questions here . You’ll be asked to describe how strongly each statement reflects your experiences in the last four weeks. All you have to do is circle one of these options on a scale of 0 to 4:.

She stood poised for photos looking proud with her head held high and personalized cane outstretched, powerfully “throwing” her Ralph & Russo gown outwards for a dramatic photographic look.

Selma was incredibly brave doing this interview, but doing the interview whilst she was also having a flare up where she was suffering from spasmodic dysphonia—meaning she was struggling to talk? That’s positively boss like. Being in the public eye and coming out in an interview that is so honest and transparent is a very brave thing for a celebrity to do. Can you imagine broadcasting to the world about your innermost personal symptoms? How scary must that have been for her? I've seen many people online say, “well it’s ok for her, but what about the rest of us that deal with this everyday? We don’t get special treatment or attention.” To those people I would say, see the bigger picture of what this means for MS and for her as an actress! She doesn’t have to just announce it to work colleagues, friends and family like we do she has to announce it to the world . Everybody in her world will be treating her differently now. She’ll be getting letters and messages from fans on a daily basis wanting to tell her about their diagnosis story. It may affect any future acting roles she gets as an actress because directors may think twice about casting her and worried she won’t be up to the job. She may even lose jobs. The most important thing that will happen now that Selma has bravely raised awareness of her condition is that the general public will now understand more about what MS is and how it affects us. Celebrities have the power to influence the general public and by sharing her story in this way she has done a very powerful thing. All those times we were told that MS wasn’t a real condition? I would hope that becomes a thing of the past. All those times doctors and neuro’s have said “it’s all in your head” (which, ironically, it actually is!), I imagine patients would be taken more seriously. So, is it a good thing that Selma Blair came out about her diagnosis? HELL YES ! She’s helping to change the worlds perception of MS. She has the ultimate platform for influence, and she’s using it for good, so let’s celebrate her for bringing MS into the mainstream media. And let’s certainly celebrate her for making an accessible clothing line because these celebrities are the only ones changing disability for the better. How do you feel about Selma’s diagnosis? Should celebrities highlight their health conditions? Comment your thoughts below and if you’ve enjoyed reading this don’t forget to click the heart to show your appreciation.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4719441373046281546/Common-treatment-for-multiple-sclerosis-may-prolong-life	"Researchers from the University of British Columbia and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute have found that a widely prescribed drug for multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with longer survival for patients. The study, published today in the journal Brain , found that people with MS who took a beta interferon drug had a 32 per cent lower mortality risk than those that did not take the drug. This was particularly evident among MS patients who took beta interferon for more than three years. The study, which followed nearly 6,000 people with MS in Canada and France over a period of more than two decades, is the first and largest of its kind to look at mortality associated with beta interferon for the treatment of MS. ""This is a significant study,"" said lead author Elaine Kingwell, a research associate and epidemiologist in the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health and the faculty of medicine at UBC, and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute. ""Although these drugs have been prescribed since the mid-1990s, it takes time before scientists can look at the effect of these treatments on a long-term outcome like survival. We found that patients who were treated with these drugs during routine clinical practice survived longer overall than patients who had not taken beta interferon."" MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, in which cells from the immune system attack and damage the nerve cells' protective sheath. The disease often results in disability and can have a significant impact on quality of life. The beta interferons were the first drugs to be approved for the treatment of relapsing-onset MS, which is the most common form of the disease. They have been used to treat MS longer than any other disease-modifying therapy. Comparing mortality rates between two countries. For the study, the researchers followed 5,989 people with relapsing-onset MS from as early as 1986 until 2013, in British Columbia and France, to determine what disease modifying drugs they took and how long they survived. The mean age of the study participants (who had not received drug treatments for MS before the start of the study) was 42 years. The mean age at death for the 742 people who did not survive to the end of the study was 61. The findings were consistent between the two geographic groups and between men and women. MS patients who took beta interferon for at least six months had a reduced mortality risk when compared to MS patients who did not take beta interferon. Taking the drug for more than three years had an even stronger association with increased survival. Moreover, increased survival was noted even for individuals who started the drug after age 40, or five or more years after disease onset. Findings are encouraging to those on beta interferon. Vancouver resident Sharon Roman, who was diagnosed with MS two decades ago, describes the results as ""encouraging."" ""The study findings could impact a lot of people, not just because of the sheer number of patients that are on beta interferon worldwide, but also because it offers comfort in terms of our longevity--and comfort is in short supply for those with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis,"" she said. ""This offers a potential incentive that could conquer a dislike or a fear of injections and might encourage people to adhere to the prescribed dosing schedule,"" she added. Quality of life needs to be considered, too. Despite the positive findings, the researchers caution that longevity isn't everything. ""Now that we know that life might be extended for people with MS who take these drugs, we do have to consider quality of life,"" said the study's senior author Helen Tremlett, professor in the division of neurology at UBC and the Canada Research Chair in neuroepidemiology and multiple sclerosis. ""Further research to look at this aspect of treatment outcomes is certainly warranted."" The researchers hope to now look at the association of survival with some of the newer MS drugs. Tremlett has received a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to undertake this work. The study was co-authored by Dr. Emmanuelle Leray at Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Santé Publique and Dr. Gilles Edan at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes in Rennes, France, and Dr. John Petkau in the department of statistics and Dr. Joel Oger and Feng Zhu in the department of medicine (neurology) at UBC. It was supported by the U.S. National Multiple Sclerosis Society and La Fondation pour l'aide à la recherche sur la sclérose en plaques."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4719094552239671128/MS-Ireland--::-Clues-to-Identify	"MS Ireland  ::. Clues to Identify. What are some clues to cognitive dysfunction? Memory problems top the list. Forgetting names, appointments, phone numbers, movie plots, what to do next, or what goes into the favourite family recipe, are examples of memory deficits. There can also be difficulty learning new information and concentrating on a task or conversational topic. Slowed information processing is also a frequent problem. Everything takes longer. It may be impossible to play games that are time sensitive. Response time is slowed. It may take longer to shave, bathe and dress. Attention and concentration suffer. Inability to focus, difficulty following a conversation or remembering details from a conversation, problems relating a story, difficulty reading, concentrating, or following a movie plot are examples of attention deficits. Being easily distracted and flitting from task to task or idea to idea are examples of difficulties with concentration. The ability to multitask or shift between tasks becomes difficult or impossible. Reasoning and problem solving difficulties, making poor decisions, and having poor judgment can be difficult to recognise and more difficult to deal with for Care Givers. Slowness to understand analogies or parables, difficulty “getting” jokes, taking things at face value, being literal or concrete, and finding it difficult to analyse complex situations, are all evidence of cognitive decline. Executive functions such as the ability to plan and carry out a task like planning a daughter’s wedding or a holiday trip can be affected in MS. Becoming overwhelmed by a pending task can result in confusion over where to begin, and may be associated with compensatory anger and withdrawal. Visual perceptual function and spatial orientation problems can include difficulty following directions or programming a VCR, confusion over right and left, and difficulty visualising how a certain piece of adaptive equipment could be useful, even driving. How can cognitive changes be managed in advanced MS? Are there medications that can help with cognitive decline? In advanced MS, cognitive decline, like physical decline, cannot be reversed. However, cognitive disorders can be treated with medication and behavioural methods. Donepezil (Aricept®), commonly used in Alzheimer’s disease, has shown a modest effect in several small trials of memory in people with MS. The use of ginko biloba in a small randomised controlled trial reported positive effects on attention and memory for people with MS. Symptom management of fatigue, depression, stress and pain can also have a positive impact on cognition. "

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702815059394732446/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	"I guess the story starts in 2002. I noticed that my right eye had started to go blurry and I went to my mother, A Nurse, to tell her. She started giving me drops to try and clear my eye, but it only got worse as weeks passed. When I told her that I couldn't see at all, we went to an eye doctor for an exam, and he had said that I was suffering form optic neuritis. After going to a few more doctors, I was put on steroids to bring the inflammation down, and it worked, but I noticed that I couldn't see as well as i could before. A few more months passed, and I has hospitalized so i could undergo testing for MS. I was looked at, poked, prodded and given a Lumbar Puncture, Which at 16 terrified me. After a week or so of waiting, the doctor called us in and told us that the tests all came back negative, but she didn't trust them. She told my mother that the LP would come back negative unless I was having an episode when they harvested the spinal fluid. the doctor told us to go to the MS center in our state and there i was given a full neurological exam. After an hour or so of walking, touching my nose and rearing charts, the specialist there, #2 in the state, diagnosed me with MS and explained, in detail, what needed to be done. When I got home, I was in such a fit of depression, that I went into my room, and stayed there for two weeks. During that time, I watched my dreams crumble before my eyes. I focused on all the things that I would no longer be able to do, and visioned the worst of what COULD happen to me. One day, my brother older brother came over and took me out. he showed me that I could still do the thing that I enjoyed, and he showed me that there are different ways to do somethings that I never would have thought about. Time went on as ""normally"" as it could, and my sight got much worse, to the point to where i am legally blind. several years later, my brother was diagnosed with MS also. Now, I cried when I heard that because I didn't want him going through the same things I had. His first year was the hardest for him. I had to help him learn how to avoid hot days and little tricks he could use to keep himself cool if he had to go out. This gave us a new way of bonding and growing closer together. Still, we try to look after each other, when we're not fighting like brothers do, and we each have someone to talk to when the depression hits us, or we just have a bad day. Now a days, I still do things i like, such as swimming, singing and various other activities. MS showed me a new way of looking at things, and is a constant reminder that the word ""can't"" doesn't really exist. It's not ""I can't do this"" It's ""How am I going to do this?"" To any and all who read this, I'm sorry I'm not a better writer, this is just what popped into my head.."

In a instant, I went from: a standing position; hitting my rear on the sidewalk; a squatting position for a second, or two; then wobbling my arms frantically in a sub-conscience attempt to stand back up straight~which I did. Immediately thereafter, I looked at my wife and daughter and we all began laughing so hard because of how fast everything occurred and what I looked like in my attempt to stand back up. Thinking the episode was nothing more than some kind of weird fluke (my knees never buckled before this in any shape, form or fashion) and after the three of us stopped laughing, we began to resume our walk; problem was though, it happened again. The first two, or so times this happened we all laughed so hard, it's amazing none of us wet ourselves. However, after this continued, my family's smiles quickly disappeared and everyone began to worry. My daughter actually became very anxious and started crying asking me in a very alarming voice, ""What's wrong Pop!?!!"" In a calm voice I told her not to worry, but to run back and get our neighbor to come pick me up. After notifying my neurologist and walking around like a duck for nearly a week (I thought I was on my way to being bedridden), my neurologist came across this (or very similar condition) in one of her MS books. She titled my knee buckling problem as a ""paroxysmal positive motor disturbance"". Her cure was to put me on Dilantin~an anti-seizure medicine. If my memory serves me correctly, I was walking normal again the same day; however, my knees continually buckled regardless of whether, or not I was just standing, or walking. But get this--my knees DO NOT buckle when I run. In regards to the Dilantin; well, once again, relying just on my memory I believe I was on it for three, or four months. Since then (the end of 2000) to present, my knees continue to buckle (whenever they feel like it... lol) I'm standing and walking; but again, THIS DOES NOT happen when I run. Further, I've never been put back on Dilantin (or any other medicine for that matter) for this condition. I came to this site to see if I could find anyone else in the MS community that had the same symptoms I have (my knees buckle spontaneously when I'm walking and standing, but NOT when I'm running). I hope you find my response helpful/informational/interesting and I'd be glad to hear/talk with anyone out there about the same topic. I'd really like to her from anyone out there that can tell me if they are experiencing they same symptoms I am. Ciao for now and Best Wishes to All; Regards...."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4717434693327038337/MS-Transparency:-How-Open-Should-I-Be?---MS-Connection	"MS Transparency: How Open Should I Be? - MS Connection. Do I walk over and explain to the dude in the garage—the one who’s been giving me the stink eye ever since I pulled into a disabled parking spot—that, while I appear to be healthy, I actually have MS? Do I tell my students what’s going on when I’m pressing my icy drink against my neck to cool me off while I’m teaching inside an overheated classroom, fretting about whether my MS heat sensitivity will flare up? I face these situations quite frequently, wondering whether I should explain my MS to people so they will understand my actions and reactions, or if I should just keep quiet. Four years into my MS odyssey, I haven’t yet found the sweet spot. I’m torn between the concept of total openness about my situation, and just wanting to live my life as best I can without making excuses or explanations for things I cannot control. It’s not as though I’ve hidden my MS from the world. I’ve had pieces published—and shared them on social media—discussing my experiences with the disease. But writing about it is not the same as telling someone in a moment when I’m experiencing something related to my disease, that this is what MS looks like for me today. Do I need to tell the clerk at the grocery store that I’m not intentionally dropping item after item onto the conveyor belt as some sort of indication that I’m impatient with her work; I’m simply having a clumsy MS hands day. Or is that too much to share with someone who’s bagging your onions, orange juice and window cleaner? I admit that my perspective on this subject may be skewed because I spend a lot of time thinking about MS when it interferes with my daily life. People who know I have MS tell me the disease doesn’t automatically come to their minds when we’re interacting because I don’t look sick most of the time. However, I worry that when I cancel plans at the last minute because of fatigue, they won’t understand it’s MS-related (and not laziness) unless I explicitly tell them. I don’t want them to misinterpret the cancelation and think I just don’t want to see them. One of my close friends thinks I should be more open about MS, particularly with my college students. She suggests it would be a great life lesson for them to realize that, as I energetically discuss the day’s news with them, I’m also living with a chronic illness that sometimes affects how I move about in the world. There was one recent day when I almost took her advice. The classroom was getting really warm and uncomfortable. I removed as much clothing as is socially acceptable and sucked down my cool drink (I always bring one to class.) Nevertheless, I started feeling lightheaded, weak, nauseous and as if the speed at which I was processing things mentally was slowing down. I considered explaining why I felt this way. But I chickened out. The students probably would have been fine with the disclosure and would have welcomed a short break. But as I played the scenario out in my head, I envisioned this MS revelation as potentially having a negative effect on teaching evaluations, as emboldening some to challenge grades based on my illness or to question whether MS was the reason it was taking me so long to review their work. In reality, I put in a lot of effort for my students and try to overcompensate for any obstacles MS puts in my way. So, would anything bad really have happened had I told them about the MS? Likely not. But you never know. The closest thing I’ve done to being transparent about my as-of-now invisible disease is to print out two pieces of paper and slide them in the front windshield of my car whenever I use my disabled parking placard. One features a colorful orange “Multiple Sclerosis Awareness” logo, the other features the black and orange logo for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, underneath which I’ve written, “I have MS.” These thin pieces of paper represent the sum total of my attempts to dissuade any would-be nasty-note-writers from tucking a menacing missive beneath my windshield wipers. I’m not sure there is one correct answer. I’m also not sure I should be worrying so much about what people are thinking when I experience an MS symptom or take measures to avoid triggering one (by taking an elevator up a single floor or utilizing disabled parking). However, I am sure of one thing: I am fortunate to have this choice because not everyone with MS does. Deciding what to do and how to react is a privilege.

Thursday March 14 2019 10:54 AM. This week we get to share in a conversation between two MS and Me bloggers, Fergal Hughes and Willeke van Eeckhoutte. Read on for their personal take on some of the issues MS brings to their lives . It's tough. Life with MS is tougher than life without MS of course. That said, I doubt that any of us MSers would say our life is tougher than someone else's...anyone else's, MS or no MS! “Walk a mile in someone else's shoes” and all that. Still, MS does have more than its fair share of negative points and it gives us more than our fair share of ‘bad days'. With our new friendship, we ( Willeke van Eeckhoutte and Fergal Hughes ) find we enjoy convincing each other that it's not all bad and that every cloud has a silver lining. WvE: Life with MS put a big exclamation mark in my life... and I wasn't having it! No more hillwalking or thinking of chasing cows in the middle of nowhere only to realise there is a bull just 150 metres ahead of me! FH: Even though some capabilities may have been taken from you, you just need to remind yourself that you can still do what you can do and, well, you'll keep doing it. The goalposts may have been moved – personally, what I now consider to be a major achievement is certainly different to what it was some years ago – but I'm pretty sure you have the confidence and strength to deal with it and adapt. FH: Me, I work as a software engineer. This is both brilliant and not so brilliant. My job requires that I sit down for 8 hours a day. This means there's minimal call for me to be physical but it also means I get minimum chance to be mobile or to work the muscles. Also, my mind has to constantly be in tip-top condition … and with MS that can be a struggle. WvE: My experience is that lately, it seems that my concentration and memory have gone to tatters. My prospective memory especially has led to awkward situations because I agree to do certain tasks, but then I can't remember that I had to remember to perform that task. The intention is there and unless I sticky-tape notes to every wall of the house, I often find myself apologising. WvE: This is no joke. It takes 100% true grit trying to stay awake for five minutes once I put my head on my pillow. Can you imagine having a relationship like this? I have to watch episodes of my favourite shows five or six times to see the whole 45-minute program! What's your secret, Fergal? FH: Combatting fatigue is no easy matter, Willeke. I've found that a regular schedule for going to bed at a particular time every evening and getting up at roughly the same time every morning helps me … as long as I stick to it! As long as I give my body and mind the best possible chance , the closer to a ‘normal life' I get. FH: I'm a worrier. It's alright saying I live in the 'here and now' but shouldn't I at least consider the worst possible future … so I'll be prepared for it if it did happen. WvE: As a great philosopher once said, ‘Don't worry, be happy'. But hey, always remember, you can't control the future. You can maybe have an effect on today and this week but let the long-term future take care of itself. A BURDEN ON OTHERS. WvE: I feel shut out when people tell me I don't need to worry about certain news, that I have enough on my mind already. I tell them again and again that they don't need to worry about what I live with, but I cannot convince them. Backup or tips needed here, Fergal! FH: No one wants to feel like a burden on family or friends. But come on, Willeke, we can't control how others feel. And anyway, we might be wrong! I KNEW I WAS DEPRESSED BUT WAS AFRAID OF REACHING OUT. FH: I waited too long to get help and felt there wasn't much support available in my community. When I eventually found a therapist, it was expensive enough for the amount of time I was given. WvE: I'm sorry to hear that Fergal. People with MS need more readily available access to mental health services. Once I opened up, I felt relief knowing I was not the only one. Therapists might have group sessions also for ‘people with chronic illnesses'."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4716933960767226982/Could-I-Have-MS?	"Hello all,. I'll try to keep this brief. A week and a half ago a shelter house in our yard blew into our neighbor's yard and I had to go take it down and move it. Our neighbor was a very stressful experience as he was swearing at me and very angry. Then later in the day I was lifting 25 pound concrete blocks and at one point carried one on a shoulder. A couple of hours later I started making dinner and my feet/legs started getting tingling/burning/muscle soreness feeling. The next day my upper back, shoulders, arms, and hands were also experiencing the same symptoms and it's continued every day since then. On Sunday I wore heels and my sciatica went crazy for about 24 hours. I've had that for over 20 years but normally it doesn't act up unless I do something to irritate it. So these symptoms come and go throughout the day, and go away completely at night. If I'm laying down and very relaxed they are almost gone as well. If I am relaxed in general they are better. I'll wake up in the morning and feel normal and then the symptoms will start again. I'm a full-time student so I sit/use my hands a lot. These sensations and aches are worse when I'm sitting, typing, writing, or driving. If I change positions or walk or move in some way then the sensations/aches will get better. Then today the front of my tongue feels tingly. So that has me worried. I am under a lot of stress. Does this sound like it could be MS or is this a combination of stress/injury from all the lifting I did?"

I'm not sure about disability benefits but I have heard the lack of write offs is supposedly offset by a higher basic deduction? I haven't gotten mine back from the accountant but I think I liked all the deductions better. Yeah; I'm not concerned about ""write-offs"". I don't itemize my deductions so they don't affect me. And, yes; there is a larger standard deduction this year. That doesn't explain why my disability benefit is taxed at a much higher rate this year. An SSDI disability benefit is income.

The doctors believed that the symptoms were not related and said to go to the optometrist. Then, the optometrist referred me to an ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologist saw something and ordered an MRI. The MRI showed signs of MS and referred me to a neurologist. At this time, I also had vertigo and motion sickness. I was diagnosed and spent three days getting an IV of steroids. After a week, I was normal again. All the symptoms were related to the MS. When I first was diagnosed, I was scared.

I have found the more I work out the better I feel. This past year my family and I participated in the Walk MS in Snohomish County.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4703875468334008136/MS-Ireland--::-Providing-Care	"MS Ireland  ::. Caring for someone with MS can be deeply satisfying. Partners, family, and friends can be drawn more closely together when they meet the challenges. But care giving can also be physically and emotionally exhausting, especially for the person who is the primary caregiver. That person is most often a partner or spouse, but can also be a child, parent, or friend. There are a wide range of care giving activities, just as there are a wide range of abilities and disabilities among people with MS. Someone who is a Care Giver to a person who has relatively few functional difficulties may be helping with injections of a disease-modifying drug and offering support in dealing with the medical team. Someone who is a Care Giver for a person with a more severe level of disability may be involved in daily activities like toileting, dressing, transferring, and feeding, as well as medical treatments. How can you improve the quality of care you provide? What changes (if any) need to be made? Here are some guidelines for evaluating your role in the ongoing care process:. Obviously, perfect balance is impossible, and probably not even desirable. But you should look for times where you can “make room for yourself,” and get some perspective. Remember to be a Care Giver for yourself, too. "	"353,358"	1		"360,366"	1

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4703875410451792690/MS-Ireland--::-Dietician	"MS Ireland  ::. A dietitian provides a high-quality therapeutic and nutritional advisory service to improve a person's health. This may be done within the hospital setting as part of a multi-professional team or within the community. A healthy diet is important for everyone and many people with MS find it a good way to manage their health. A healthy, balanced diet, combined with the right exercise, can help to:. Many different diet therapies have been advocated in the management of MS. Some people feel specialist diets make a difference to how they feel, perhaps by reducing relapse rate or improving their overall quality of life; others don’t feel this way. At the moment, there isn’t any conclusive evidence to suggest they are effective. Following one of these diets is an individual choice – but if you do decide to try a new diet, it’s important to make sure you still get enough energy and all your essential nutrients. You should speak to a dietitian before making any major changes to your diet, particularly if you have any other health conditions which might also affect your dietary needs. In some centres, dietitians work as part of a multi-disciplinary team in the care of those with MS. In this situation, one may access the dietician while attending the multi-disciplinary MS clinic. Otherwise, a dietitian will be available through referral from the hospital consultant. You can also contact a private dietitian via the website of the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute. Dietitian or nutritionist? It is important to understand the difference between a dietitian, a nutritionist and a nutritional therapist. Many people claim to be experts in nutrition yet have very limited knowledge and do not offer protection to the public. Choosing the right person from whom to seek help and advice can sometimes be a confusing task. This is not helped by an increasing number of self- proclaimed or alternative ‘nutrition practitioners’ emerging from informal courses. Such courses are not recognised by the State or by Irish Universities. Further information and advice on choosing a qualified practitioner can be found on the website of the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695087154427367612/Incomplete-transverse-myelitis---Neurology---MedHelp	"Hi - I am currently undergoing a lot of examinations as I have 2 lesions on the spinal cord (incomplete transverse myelitis). One placed cervical and one further down. No lesions on the brain. I am very concerned about the lack of progress the doctors are making finding out what is causing this. So far I have seen a neurologist and currently I am being examined for infections. It was back in September I had my MRI and lumbal puncture. As mentioned above the MRI revealed two lesions on the spine. Tests of the csf revealed oligoclonal bands. WBC in CSF was 43. Borrelia was negative in CSF and Blood. Negative tests for HSV-1 and HSV-2 in CSF. Doctors concluded that there was no infection in CSF. Thus suspecting auto-immune, demylenating disease (MS). I am told I have CIS. Blood tests revealed elevated WBC in blood. Neutrophillocytes (8.01), Monocytes (0.84), Leukocytes (11,3). Lymphocytes are normal. They have NOT made test for oligoclonal bands in the blood. Would you think this could be a postinfectious/infectious incident of Partial Transverse Myelitis? Further info: Paraneoplastic markers are all negative. My general health is good and I only have minor symptoms that have become less and less since june.. (tingling, burning sensations on/off, primarily right side, but lately a bit more symmetrical. Symptoms change position and severity - but in general very mild). I am ""positive"" it is caused by an infection as I have been struggling a lot with urinary tract infections in recent years - suspecting mycoplasma. But when being examined by a MS expert it seems they want you to fit the MS diagnose and not investigate things much further."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692591180743991592/Post-operative-risks-and-MS---Multiple-Sclerosis---MS-----MedHelp	"Dear Dr. Kantor,. My dilemma is not about whether I have MS or not but advice on another procedure I am due to have carried out. In September last year I had problems with my legs to the point of being unable to walk for a time, which ended in being referred to an orthopedic surgeon. An MRI on my knees in January this year revealed that the right knee has some reduced space, bits of bone / debris and a tear in the meniscus cartilage. This was anticipated as it has given me problems for approximately 12 years. An arthroscopy was recommended and is booked to go ahead on 1st May. However, the surgeon felt that the main problem with my legs that I had been referred for was probably neurological –and adviced me to talk to my neurologist. I had a further meeting with my neurologist last week to discuss the symptoms I had experienced in my legs. I was diagnosed with mild MS in December last year and during the diagnosis phase we had not considered my knees / legs as I had been told by my GP it was a physical injury, caused by overuse. The neuro has now ordered an MRI of the spine, a full neurological exam (it did not include my legs last time) and an LP if the first 2 tests are not conclusive. He also said 'Are you sure you have enough pain in the right knee for surgery?', as he is now sure that my leg problems were typical for MS. During my leg problems the left knee was much worse but no problems were detected on the MRI. My questions are:. Should I go ahead with an arthroscopy or delay it until my MS diagnosis process is complete? As the operation is predominately diagnostic, although he does think my knee will be more 'comfortable' afterwards, would it be an unnecessary risk having a full anesthetic for a diagnostic operation, are there extra risks with MS in this? Thank you and sorry to be so long winded but the story is a real mix up of symptoms being mistaken by both me and my GP."

More details in question details. - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp. Hi and welcome to the MS community although what your dealing with is not specifically an MS issue, people with MS can and do still experience Plantar Fasciitis and Heel Spurs just like anybody. It's possible with plantar fasciitis and heel spurs to additionally experience compensatory ankle issues basically because the ankle joint has to do a lot more work to keep the ankle stable and it can cause pain or discomfort that runs down either side of the ankle bone. One of the more common causes of plantar fasciitis and heel spurs, as well as ankle issues, is not actually a problem with the feet or ankle but from overly tight calf muscles, which is why calf stretching is typically part of the treatment plan. ""Exercise. Plantar fasciitis is aggravated by tight muscles in your feet and calves. Stretching your calves and plantar fascia is the most effective way to relieve the pain that comes with this condition. Lean forward against a wall with one knee straight and the heel on the ground. Place the other leg in front, with the knee bent. To stretch the calf muscles and the heel cord, push your hips toward the wall in a controlled fashion. Hold the position for 10 seconds and relax. Repeat this exercise 20 times for each foot. A strong pull in the calf should be felt during the stretch. Plantar fascia stretch. This stretch is performed in the seated position. Cross your affected foot over the knee of your other leg. Grasp the toes of your painful foot and slowly pull them toward you in a controlled fashion. If it is difficult to reach your foot, wrap a towel around your big toe to help pull your toes toward you. Place your other hand along the plantar fascia. The fascia should feel like a tight band along the bottom of your foot when stretched. Hold the stretch for 10 seconds. Repeat it 20 times for each foot. This exercise is best done in the morning before standing or walking."" I'd recommend you consult your dr and consider seeing a physio. Hope that helps......"																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694670005211178121/Swift-Progression-linked-to-Anxiety---Multiple-Sclerosis---MedHelp	"I had my neuro appointment last week to figure out why I had such a fast progression. I rolled in there with my wheelchair expecting to hear I had ALS or some kind of awful illness. My neuro examined me as usual and then sat me down. He ever so gently told me that although he thinks I MS, he is pretty sure that my swift progression is psychosomatic. My reaction was tears. I cried because I knew deep down that he was probably right. He wasn't saying that there is nothing going on, but he was saying that all most of my mobility issues were due to fear and anxiety. As some of you may recall, this is not the first time I had heard this. He said if it is not MS, he is still concerned with all the ""spots"" on my brain MRI. He said I could be one of those people with a rare neurological disorder that they don't normally see. I think he was just trying to make me feel like I wasn't a nut job! He's very caring. He is having me get a second opinion from the MS neuro in the practice. Upon leaving his office I proceeded to feel really sorry for myself. After that, I decided to get out of that damn wheelchair and start walking. None to my surprise I can walk. Now I am not walking like a ""normal"" person, but I can get around to living. A few days later I saw my psychiatrist, who had already spoken to my neuro, and he said I did not have conversion disorder, but I did have much anxiety. We left off agreeing that I should take daily ""walks."" Next week I will see a psychologist and finally start dealing with this anxiety. It is something I can no longer ignore. Today I saw a chiropractor who lives on my street wouldn't you know. He said that he could see why my legs were initially having difficulty. My spine is all jammed up. I am also going to get acupuncture to help deal with the anxiety issues. I see him again on Monday. Next week I see the other neuro and if he says he doesn't think I have MS, I am going to stop looking. I am not hoping I have MS as this year has been hell for my family. I do know for sure that if it is indeed MS, it is not going to kill me anytime soon and I am very capable of functioning normally most days. I want to thank all of you on the forum who have followed me this last year. It has been very enlightening. But the thing I like the most about this forum is that no one will be dis honest. There have been many times that I have been ""called out"" on my posts and it has made me be honest with myself and really discover the root of my issues. So far I have figured out I have had one AWFUL childhood. I don't think I ever had the guts to admit but there it is. Maybe I should make a stop at the mental health forum. Can't hurt! Keep looking up! "																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692591195922662710/Scintillating-Scotomas-and-MS---Multiple-Sclerosis---MedHelp	"Hi to old friends and hello to new members who have never even heard of me :-). I'm afraid I'm being really cheeky here again after disappearing from your lives for a while, I come back and ask questions of the 'real' experts when my neuro is being a twit as he so often is. By the way, twit is an English expression that replaces the expletives that should be applied to him! So my question is: has anyone around here suffered from Scintillating Scotomas SS (Visual aura with no migraine)? The reason I ask is I started getting these about a year ago. When they happen I get a clutch of them altogether in a few days, sometimes several a day, and then they stop again for a month or so. They are often accompanied by other MSy type symptoms, but I can't establish which is instigating which. As SS is a concern when it's starts at 60+ I was whisked off to the TIA clinic initially:. Consultant there said it's not vascular it's neurological go see your MS neuro. My neuro says it's not neurological it's vascular and it's migraine. Don't worry have a look at the Migraine Trust website. The website says if this occurs for the first time in over 60s the diagnosis should be guarded and looked at carefully as it's associated with stroke. I ask again of MS team and they order Carotid Doppler, EEG, blood tests, etc. nothing shows up all fine! So here's my conundrum:. I was diagnosed with tendency to epilepsy before I was diagnosed with MS. We know MS can cause epilepsy, my neuro says there is no relationship between epilepsy and MS! But SS is also associated with epilepsy. Then I was diagnosed with MS. Now I've been diagnosed with Migraine too, Migraine is associated with epilepsy and with MS but my neuro says no! Can one person really have 3 neurological problems and none of them be connected? Particularly as I know I have lesions in the visual cortex and my vision has always been an issue, hence my user name. Thanks guys, hope you don't mind me dropping by."

Yes, if you are pregnant STOP the Rebif. The problem with the interferons and pregnancy is that they have a powerful ability to cause miscarriage. All of the interferons do. Now that you are already pregnant all you can do is stop the med. In my reading the tendency to cause miscarriage is the main concern. I read repeatedly that in the pregnancies that went on to deliver, that there was no problem with malformations or any other type of birth defect. The babies are healthy. So, I would think there is no reason to even consider terminating the pregnancy on this basis. But, I am NOT an expert in this field!! Now, this is a hugely important topic. I want you to get ahold of an OB and get this question to them ASAP. While you are waiting for official answers I believe that you should stop the Rebif immediately. And I hope this is a welcome pregnancy. Pregnancy does not complicate MS at all. In fact the majority of women feel much better and have far fewer relapses while pregnant. there is even some data that suggest that pregnancy can exert a favorable influence on the lifetime disease. The main concern is the high likelihood of a relaspe in the 3 months following delivery, so this should be kept in mind when deciding on returning to work or in having extra help available. Welocme again and Congratulations!"	"511,517"	2																																																																																					
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692591198702110490/Help-reading-the-MRI-report---Multiple-Sclerosis---MedHelp	"Hi and welcome,. In the findings section of your report it provides you with specific lesion information...""These are old rounded and measure approximately 1 mm. These are nonspecific and could represent incidental gliosis. Migraine related white matter change could also cause these findings. These are not typical for demyelination."" A few 'tiny' (less than 3mm in size) round shaped white matter lesions only located in the subcortical area are very common findings and because of the shape, size and singular common location it would generally indicate these findings are highly unlikely to be demyelinating lesions, which are the specific type of lesions suggestive-consistent with MS. Your MRI report also states within the conclusions section that your MRI only showed ""Occasional subcortical white matter hyperintensities in the centrum semiovale ovale probably incidental gliosis. IF MS was one of the potential causation's you were being assessed for, what ever symptoms, neurologically abnormal clinical signs you have etc, it looks like your brain MRI evidence alone would be placing a condition like MS very low down on your potential causes list, so it's very possible what you've experienced is not related to a neurological condition like MS and one of it's mimics. I hope that helps..... sorry typo, it should read....so it's very possible what you've experienced is not related to a neurological condition like MS and it is one of MS's many mimics instead. Thanks for providing more details to this. I wanted to mention I have few symptoms such as tremors, pins and needles, spasms. Please advisde why the radiologist said these are not typical for demyelination. ""In the findings section of your report it provides you with specific lesion information...""These are old rounded and measure approximately 1 mm. IF you are asking ""why the radiologist said these are not typical for demyelination"" when you didn't actually have a brain MRI to even look for MS, and the radiologist just mentioning 'demyelination' is confusing or worrying you... Radiologists generally examine patients MRI scans and report any normal and abnormal findings they see, Radiologists typically use structured reporting or contextual reporting templates, which are basically standardised text blocks for the different types of things commonly found on an MRI that he/she can pick and choose to put into an individuals report. ""These are nonspecific and could represent incidental gliosis. These are not typical for demyelination."" is likely to be the standardised text block the radiologist uses for non specific white matter hypersensitivities (WMH). Non specific means that the WMH’s are not specific to any disorder but in order to establish clinical significance, the findings need to be correlated with a your clinical history and neurological examination. Symptoms are not the same as 'clinical' objective signs of neurological abnormality eg Clonus, Babinski sign, hyperreflexia etc. Unfortunately the types of symptoms you've mentioned could literally be caused by many different things, having the occasional tiny 1 mm sized lesion in only the subcortical area would usually be an unlikely explanation for any abnormal clinical signs, so what ever is causing you these issues is probably not being caused by a brain related abnormality. I hope that helps......"

I got these off the internet: slow word recall, abnormal pupil responses, infrequent bowel movements, short term memory loss, vision problems, problems empying my bladder, unbalanced and incontinence (at night when i get out of bed to go to the bathroom) I am on Humira. It lowers your immune system and can cause MS. The first thing I noticed was my vision seemed to have changed over night. I have wore glasses for far away objects for years but now I have trouble seeing things close up. It was so sudden. I went to an ophthamologist and he said it was from my diabetes. He said my vision would fluctuate with my sugar and i told him it was hard to to see things close up all the time. He just dismissed it. The highest my sugar has been other than the glucose tolerance test is 188. If there is such a thing as low grade diabetes then thats what i have. Before that a woman checked my pupils and she said my left pupil got bigger when she shined the light in my eyes and the right one constricted really slow. The doctor didn't even mention that. I was told to come back in 1-2 weeks so his partner could test me and fit me for contacts. The doctor also said that my old prescription was too strong for my eyes. But they have always helped me to see far off. I am only 28 and i have to hold things a way from my face to read it. I have also had to get my husband to read things for me because it was to small. I have an appointment to see a neuro-ophthamologist. I am scared to know the results. I am going to him for a second opinion. Can anyone tell me what he will do. I want to know what to expect."

My brain had a legion, but other test showed nothing. Soon I got dropped from the program I was on. For a bit I was fine, but now I am having stomach issues, weakness, muscle spasms, and many more issues. I wouldn't be so worried but I don't know what to expect. I already have done so much to try to get answers but without insurance it's hard. My husband is always worried about me. Does it sound like MS?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692591202281474061/MS-and-IBS---Multiple-Sclerosis---MedHelp	"From memory yes though its constipation thats more closely connected to MS than actual true IBS. One of the problems is that IBS is too readily dx, if you have a history of constipation or diarrhea you'll end up with a dx of IBS. By Karen S. Kaufman, MS, CCN. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal ailment that affects up to 20 percent of the population.1 IBS symptoms include cramps, abdominal pain, gas, bloating, and alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea. These symptoms range from being mildly annoying to very painful and disabling. According to one study, about 35 million people currently suffer from IBS. Women are afflicted about twice as often as men. Given the large number of people suffering from IBS, it is not surprising that a similarly high percentage of pharmaceutical advertising is devoted to popularizing over the counter medications for symptoms such as intestinal gas, bloating, diarrhea or constipation. IBS is caused by dysfunctions in bowel motility--from whatever cause. Both hyper- (excessive) or hypo- (inadequate) bowel motility may lead, respectively, to constipation or diarrhea. People with IBS are either very sensitive to or have excessive amounts of gut hormones such as Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP), Cholecystokinin (CCK), and motilin. These substances can cause motility disturbances throughout the upper GI tract and colon.2. Constipation is the more common issue for MSers but diarrhea isn't though bouts of constipation can cause leakages getting past the obstruction but its not really classed as diarrhea. Is that too much information? Sometimes the meds cause bowel issues so thats worth checking out if you havent already. I'm sure there lots on the topic in our archives if you want to go looking, sorry i'm exhausted or i'd find something for you."																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692944730651178316/Is-this-progression-of-MS?-Am-I-typical?---Multiple-Sclerosis---MS-----MedHelp	"Is this progression of MS? Am I typical? - Multiple Sclerosis - MS - - MedHelp. I was diagnosed with RRMS last February after two bouts of ON, abnormal MRI, leg that seemed like it was not there, extreme fatigue, bathroom issues, and tests that were normal. I have had a lot of sensory symptoms that include numbness but have never had a limb go completely numb. I have been on Avonex almost a year. I sleep a lot but I had to stop taking Provigil because it was shooting my bp up too high. ;( So I just sleep when I need to now. I feel more rested and feel better. My PT wants me to ask if Provigil can cause weakness and balance problems? Over the past year the new symptoms I have are progression of weakness, balance issues, and tremors. I am going to weekly PT and OT. Both have recommended I get a rollator for in the home and a scooter for outside of my home. It is confusing when one week I need my walker and the next I am fairly steady. My MS doctor is not completly happy with how I am doing. I know my question is difficult to answer but is it possible for my strength and balance to get back to normal? My balance is bad enough my PT says I should not be walking unassisted. That is why I have the rollator. My hand strength is pathetic. I can not do resistance exersices so they have me doing isometric. I am wondering how I got here. I used to be very physically strong for a girl. I could pass a foot ball as far as any guy! But now I am so weak I can not easily lift a one pound weight. How does this happen without me noticing? I knew things were going on but didn't realize how bad it was until I got into therapy. I have been over compensating in other areas long enough now I guess I just didn't realize what was happening. I have a great MS specialist taking care of me. I hope this makes sense. "																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692591199001976290/How-severe-of-MS?---Multiple-Sclerosis---MS-----MedHelp	"How severe of MS? - Multiple Sclerosis - MS - - MedHelp. As a woman with MS I have had the concerns too about having a pregnancy after diagnosis of MS. Pregnancy actually puts MS into remission while you are pregnant, but the risk of relapse after pregnancy is higher than if you had never been pregnant. I would say that comes out to about neutral, wouldn't you? Female hormones have a suppressing effect on MS and other ""autoimmune"" disorders. There was a study done on estriol, a hormone that the body makes while pregnant, and the women who were taking it had their MS go into remission. Since then some have discredited the study, and the FDA has tried to outlaw estriol. The only way to get it right now is for menopausal or perimenopausal symptoms. Some women get perimenopause in their 30's. And then it has to be made up by a compounding pharmacy, which there are some around, not too big a deal. The cost is very low. Anyhoo - from what I could find the risk of MS in your child could be as high as one in 35 or so. But if you breastfeed very well (for up to 3 years) it will lay down a very thick coat of myelin in your child's brain as well as help their immune system. Not being breastfed and especially being put on cow milk formula in infancy is a major trigger for those of us who have the MS gene (of course, we don't find out until later in life). My naturopath tells me that a pregnancy would be great for my body in suppressing the MS but I am not willing to do that until more ducks are in a row. LOL ; ). I am not sure if breastfeeding protects you from progressing in the MS but I think it may since you have all those extra female hormones. That is what I am banking on for future childbearing. I am on Avonex and you shouldn't get pregnant while on Avonex as they don't know yet if it is a tetragen (cause birth defects). I would suspect that you would not want to be on a shot while breastfeeding either. You would have to look into it further. As far as the cost of the meds, until the national healthcare stuff goes through, you have to find a better employer for yourself or spouse if the cost of the meds is too much. You can ask the National MS Society for financial help. The state is no help unless you want to ""pay down"" the difference between your income and the medicaid income eligibility level (below poverty line). Biogen Idec has a program for people who can't afford their meds that really helped a friend of mine. You could give them a call. I think they are the makers of a couple of the drug therapies but I don't know if they make the one you are considering. I chose avonex because it had the least number of injections LOL ; ) and luckily it is working well for me (Biogen Idec is the maker of Avonex). Women are the ones who get autoimmune conditions the most and I think it maybe because we are not living our natural ""cave woman"" life of constant babies and nursing. MS is a first world disease and I think that has a lot to do with it. The women in previous generations who had the MS gene, it was masked by all the female hormones in their system due to pregnancy and nursing and of course they were probably nursed themselves. So the changes in childbearing and rearing practices could be part of why we are seeing more MS and other autoimmune conditions as time goes on. Of course we also have more plastics, etc. too (never microwave in tupperware or plastic wrap! in fact, don't microwave at all. Other countries have outlawed them.)."

Mycoplasma levels are hard to control and one non lyme specific issue is my white blood cell count has been high for 3 years can anyone please tell me if this is common with ms? I am having the visual test again and mri of spine. Last opthamologist appointment I was told I had occular rosacea? and by chance had missed one of the color charts red plate. 4 months prior I had no issues. Since the birth of my son (surprise baby) I have been on a downward spiral. Pain, balance, muscle spasms, walking issues, tremors, sleep issues and fatigue. I take medication to help but not much seems to help provigil is not too helpful anymore. I have severe neck pain and back pain. I take hydrocodone Ibuprofen, clonipin (sp?) Lyrica, medication for arthritis, antibiotics, sleeping meds... you name it. I think the side effects are awful but not taking them would be worse. Lots of the meds have caused weight gain and although a small issue it bothers me. I suffer incontinence in bouts also have bowel issues. I have numbness and tingling and am very weak. I try to exercise but it leaves me suffering for days after. If the tests being peformed now are negative my neuro wants to send me to UVA to specialist. After all the docs I was reserved to go to yet another dr but at this point I know I have to and will run there if I have to. For the first time in my life I have ADD. I cannot focus have issue with word finding and just feel like a doofus sometimes. Reading and keeping on the same line is tough.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692944702712772209/Criteria-for-Starting-DMDs---Multiple-Sclerosis---MS-----MedHelp	"Hi--I'm the one new around here who has had MS 36 years and have not been treated with DMD's. BUT--I sort of slipped into not taking one because I had already had MS about 15-20 years before they became available. And thoise years were manageable with sensory symptoms alone for the most part. I do think if at all possible everyone with MS (along with their doctor) choose one that is palatable and ""get right to it"" after perhaos waiting and seeing what the first 6mos to a year brings, oif inital symptoms are very slight. It only makes sense to me to protect ourselves for the future. That said, I am one who especially hates the ""Benign"" diagnosis----there is very very little about MS which is benign! Add it all up and I doubt if it EVER is Benign. MS is a hideous disease which has the potential to affect evevy single aspect of our lives. Take away a neuro's judgment, concentration, ability to speak and walk, sex life, energy levels, composure and self-esteem and ask them is it's benign for them!!! My former neuro called my 36 year old MS Benign because I could walk (but not far and not well.) She said I didn't have enough going on to make it less than Benign. Now a few months later after a long lasting infection, I can barely stagger from room to room at times and always use a cane. My, how categories can change when you're not having fun. What's an injection when it can even potentially protect us from tragedy?

When I starting getting stronger and was getting some feeling back and then the pain kicked in. I Was asked what time of the day did my pain occur. I Couldn't answer that because it was all over the place. I don't know why, but I thought maybe the weather played a part in it. I tracked the weather for a year documenting the dew point, temperatures, air pressure,and wind along with my symptoms. I found a pattern between high and low pressure as well as temperature. When the air pressure is low I am stiff, spastic,cramped up, and have insurmountable fatigue. I Always cry when the air pressure drops and I'm not sad. When the air pressure is high, I feel weak, ache all over, I am sensitive to touch, loud sounds, and other peoples energy. When the pressure changes quickly, my ears pop. When the temperature is cold, I am stiff and spastic. When the temperature is warm, I am weak, I feel nauseous, dizzy, numb, and muscle cramps. I live in Minnesota where changes in weather can be extreme often. I have a small window that feels just right. 29.95-30.15 inches for air pressure and 70-75 degrees with a dew point in the mid-fouties..

Your questions, however, surround non medicines, so I will address these:. 1. Massage therapy -- if you call it ""neuromuscular therapy"" it is usually covered by your insurance company. This can help relieve spasticity and make you feel better. 2. Acupuncture -- this can help pain and other symptoms. 3. Reflexology -- It may make you feel better. 4. Exercise -- This is great (even weight bearing exercises), but please make sure that you stay well hydrated and cool. This can help with general wellbeing and health (remember, MS does not prtect you against heart disease etc.), spasticity, weakness, fatigue .... It is always important to weight the costs of these treatments (exercise is the cheapest) against the benefits. My general rule is that if it makes you feel good and is safe, then it is probably worth it.

Even when receiving very good skin care, research has shown that the number of skin wounds rises due to risk factors such as lack of movement and muscle spasms, taking in less food and fluid, a weak immune system, loss of the ability to feel pain, and loss of bowel and bladder control. This section provides tips and advice on caring for skin. Your role may be ‘hands-on’, i.e. checking the skin for signs of redness or irritation, applying moisturizing creams, changing dressings, turning and positioning, or applying booties, lambskin or other pressure reducing surfaces in order to prevent or treat pressure sores. Or your role could be one of “manager”, i.e., supervising home health staff, or calling nurses or other health care professionals regarding skin status in order to ensure that appropriate care is being provided. At the earliest sign of skin breakdown contact your GP or Public Health Nurse immediately. "

Providing emotional support and physical care for someone with MS can be deeply rewarding. It can also be overwhelming. The strain of balancing care with other responsibilities can lead to feelings of martyrdom, anger, depression and guilt. One of the biggest mistakes Care Givers make is thinking they can handle everything alone. The key thing to remember is that you have to take care of yourself, too. If you don't, you may find it challenging to be a successful caregiver. Caring for someone with multiple sclerosis (MS) can be as deeply satisfying as it is emotionally and physically exhausting. Most people with MS don't become so severely disabled that they require long-term care full time. But MS is unpredictable, and each person's experience with MS is different. Regardless of what kind of care a person with MS needs, it's important to remember that you — the caregiver — and the person you're caring for are in this together. Like any healthy relationship, this requires work from both of you. Dealing with your emotions considerations.

Many people with multiple sclerosis experience falls, which can have significant consequences for the individual. The MS Research Team at the University of Limerick, led by Professor Susan Coote, have developed a falls prevention programme for people with multiple sclerosis and we would like to assess how suitable and effective the programme is. What do I have to do? The 'Better Balance' programme consists of 12 weeks of twice-weekly classes run by a chartered physiotherapist. The classes will consist of 45 minutes of exercises aimed at improving balance, strength and walking and 45 minutes of education on topics such as fear of falling, task analysis, getting up from the floor, what devices can assist you – these will include group discussions and problem solving. There will also be a home exercise programme provided to each participant. The classes will take place in Limerick and Galway and will be offered in the morning and/or evening depending on the preference of the individuals attending. Beginning in January, interested individuals will be asked to attend an assessment day where a chartered physiotherapist will test your strength, balance, walking and feelings about falls. We will then give you falls diaries to complete for two months. This is like a calendar where you will write down if you had a fall. After these two months, the classes will begin. When the 12 weeks of classes are finished you will again have your strength, balance, walking and feelings about falls assessed and complete another two months of falls diaries to see if the intervention has been successful. After completing the two months of falls diaries you will attend one last assessment with the researcher to assess your strength, balance, walking and feelings about falls. Who can participate? To be eligible to take part you must have multiple sclerosis, be over the age of 18 years, have experienced a fall in the last three months, and be able to walk for 10 metres with or without a walking aid (one stick or one crutch). Get in touch. If you would be interested in taking part in this study or have any further questions about the study you can contact the researchers by calling Laura Comber on 086 0231335 or email Laura.comber@ul.ie or Prof. Susan Coote on (061) 234278 or email susan.coote@ul.ie."

Dr. Pringle was at that time a renowned General Practitioner with a great interest in Multiple Sclerosis. He was concerned about the disease but also its effects on those principally affected and indeed the other far-reaching side effects. Dr. Pringle went on to play a leading role in the formation of the International Federation of MS Societies, which today is the standard bearer for MS Societies across the world. The initial meeting, which was the consequence of a newspaper advertisement, was held in Lumsden Hall, in Dublin in February 1961. This meeting was well attended and momentum quickly gathered resulting in the first Annual General Meeting taking place on 8th June 1961. The Society moved into offices at 14, Merrion Sq. from where services would be administered for the next twenty years. The task of building the organisation into a vibrant support group was begun. The establishment of branches and the overall advocacy on behalf of persons and families affected by Multiple Sclerosis was to be the main thrust of the new Society. It is interesting to note that even back then there was mention of cutbacks, lack of sufficient services, home helps etc. At the end of 1982 the Society on celebrating 21 years of service made two momentous decisions. It decided to set up new office structures and to move to establish Community Services by introducing community workers to support the client base of the Society. The premises were purchased in Sandymount Green towards the end of 1982 with the aid of what was a substantial bequest at that time. The editor of MS News of the period wrote “Sandymount Green will give the Society room to grow, it will be a base for expansion of services and the membership will no longer feel excluded or embarrassed by stairs or steps”. Some of the strong personalities who were involved with the Society during the early years, apart from Brian Pringle were, Rory Whelan, Leo Markey, Irene Brindley RIP, Maura Lillis, Tom Breen, Vivien Lloyd Blood and Irving Stewart. Towards the end of the 80’s MS Care established a Respite Centre dedicated to persons with Multiple Sclerosis in Ireland. A premises was purchased with the aid of a Dept of Health grant in 1989 at 65, Bushy Park Road in Dublin and converted into a centre of excellence providing respite and eventually rehabilitation for persons with Multiple Sclerosis and other neurological disabilities. The progress of the centre continued into the nineties with the able assistance of the ‘Friends of MS Group’ who provided much needed financial assistance. People to the fore during this period were Tom Connors RIP, Mary Allen RIP, Carmel Stenson, James O’Driscoll RIP, Ned Burke and Mervyn Taylor. In April 1982, Brian Pringle passed on to his eternal reward leaving in his wake a legacy of service and dedication in the field of MS, which will be difficult to surpass. Into the nineties the emphasis was on constitutional change. Brendan Ingoldsby was recruited on secondment from the Dept of Health & Children. The Society hosted a major International Conference of MS Societies, still regarded today as one of the most successful ever organised and support was also given to the emergence of a platform of MS Societies in Europe. The organisation suffered a severe downturn in its structure in 1993 when some fundraising events failed and as a result a number of personnel departed. Procedures were put in place to redress this situation over the following three years and these were by and large successful. Consideration was given to securing the legal status of the Society and forming closer ties with MS Care. Heads of Agreement were drawn up in 1997. On 19th November 1998 a new limited company was formed with William Lonergan as Chairman of the Board and Michael Dineen as Chief Executive. This company took over all the assets, liabilities and undertakings of the former MS Ireland and the MS Care Foundation (which previously managed the Care Centre). During this period, the Society owes a debt of gratitude to Paul Hogan, Niall O’Carroll, Howard Cusack RIP, Brendan Kenna RIP, Eileen Barry RIP, Martin Nolan, Fr. Jimmy Doherty RIP, Peter Gatenby RIP, William Lonergan and John Paul. By 1998 the Society had agreed to sell Sandymount Green, a matter, which was finalised in September of 1999 when the National Office moved temporarily to the grounds of the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook. It was at this point decided to source a permanent base for MS Ireland, which would also cater for the growing service need of the membership. It was originally hoped that the Bushy Park site might accommodate all of the need but this was quickly discounted. The MS Resource Centre was purchased to house the Society’s administrative offices at 80 Northumberland Road, Dublin 4. The MS Care Centre was extended and upgraded. MS Ireland has 10 regional offices. We are very grateful to all our volunteers who work with the organisation for the benefit of People with MS. There are 34 volunteer branches within MS Ireland. There is continued demand for our services and we look forward to the day when we shall no longer be needed because a cure will have been found for Multiple Sclerosis."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531536528013763/MS-Ireland--::-Who-Is-A-Carer?	"MS Ireland  ::. Who Is A Carer? You Are A Care Giver If You:. When The Person You Care For Is An Adult. The person you care for has the right to make decisions about his or her life. You should respect that right unless your loved one has lost the capacity to make decisions or could put others in danger through his or her behaviour. In December 2015, the Government passed the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act. This new Act, when commenced, will have significant implications for people who are caring for someone whose capacity to make decisions may be impaired. The Act provides a statutory framework for individuals who have impaired capacity or may have impaired capacity in the future to make legally-binding agreements to be assisted and supported in making decisions about their welfare and their property and affairs. More information is available here. When a Parent is a Care Giver. The return of an adult child to the home can be stressful for both the parents and the adult child. Often, this homecoming reproduces the earlier joys or struggles that may have occurred before the child became independent. This may result in the early days of such a move being a very emotive experience for both the parent/s and the adult child. It may be prudent for the family to have good support if needed at this time to get the new situation off to a good start. Parents probably have rules that they want to have respected. But the adult child needs to be treated as an adult, and some rules may presume the wrong kind of dependence. As parents age, providing care often becomes more difficult. In time, one or both parents may become ill and require care themselves. Alternative care plans and living arrangements should be discussed with the adult child well before such a crisis occurs. Parents can also care without the adult child returning home, especially if they live nearby, but also long-distance by visiting, staying over, phoning, listening, providing respite for the main carer, etc. When a Child is a Care Giver. A young carer is under the age of 18 and provides care for a family or household member who has an illness, disability, addiction or other care need. The young carer may be the main carer in the home or else helps the main carer. A young carer may do a lot of things, including household chores, medical care, help with toileting and bathing or emotional support. The need to carry out these tasks may happen regularly or only occasionally. Therefore, no two caring situations are the same. Sometimes caring is a mostly positive experience but in other cases caring can have a negative effect on a young person’s health, development and happiness. When a member of your family is diagnosed with MS you will probably experience lots of changes. There may be lots of different professionals involved with your family and relationships between family members can change, even if only for a short while. After diagnosis, some people are glad to find out what is actually wrong with them. However, it is also usual for them, and their family, to have a whole range of feelings – such as shock, anger, sadness or fear – about MS. This may mean people are upset or are short tempered. Remember that even the people who haven’t got MS have to live with it. So if it’s your dad who has MS, your mum or dad may both be sad and scared. The Young Carers Association provides a range of information and support services for young carers, including information and advice, needs assessments of young carers and their families, group work for young carers, education and employment support, peer mentoring, respite activity breaks and online support.

Indeed, many people receive the news of their diagnosis with their partner or parents and the process of dealing with the diagnosis is a team effort. For many people, it is a relief to be able to talk about it. MS can change the dynamics of a family and affect relationships. While some changes can be challenging such as the need for more help around the house, others can be very rewarding such as new hobbies discovered with family members. For a family to live with MS in the most positive way, the first stage is telling your family. The process of telling family members can sometimes be difficult. They may have lots of questions that you don’t know that answer to. They may also become upset, especially if they don't know anything about MS. Before you discuss your diagnosis with members of your family, you need to consider how you think they will react. It may be helpful to have information pamphlets available to help talk about MS and to explain what MS is. Parents often choose not to tell their children about their MS. Naturally, they do not want to frighten their children or cause them undue concern. However, children are very good at picking up changes in moods, over-hearing conversations or responding to body language, and without the appropriate information, they imagine much worse things and become upset. For children and teenagers with MS, telling family can be especially difficult. It can be an emotional process as family members feel that life will change dramatically for the young person. Most children and teenagers will rely on their parents or guardians to help them with the telling process, so it is important that both parties are comfortable with talking about the subject.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531961693518374/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	"My MS story began in college. I started noticing fatigue - both mental and physical. Whenever I walked to class (or any place where the distance was a quarter mile or more), I would get tingly sensations in my legs that felt weird but harmless - not unlike the sensation fizzy beverages have when they hit your tongue. I must add, I was following the typical diet of a careless engineering student: cheap beer, fast food, ramen, all manner of large burrito, you get the idea. This only further exacerbated problems mostly related to evacuatory functions. After grad school, I moved out west to the San Francisco Bay Area and I worked in the tech sector. It was here that I started to notice, especially when I was in the sun for any extended period of time, that my tolerance for alcohol was reduced to almost nothing. Because of this, and also because I was in poor health, I made significant lifestyle changes: I ate healthier and started swimming, lifting weights, and finally doing yoga. God I love yoga. It's this magic exercise that contains none of the monotony of other workouts (IMO). I found friends in the yoga community and travelled with them up and down the bay area doing yoga. I was working at a renewable energy firm and I actually taught yoga to my fellow employees during lunch. In 2012, walking started to become more and more difficult and at the end of July I was formally diagnosed. Work became harder and harder and I was eventually let go. I tried to reinvent myself, rooming with close friends in San Francisco, but walking difficulties precluded most activities in that hilly city. Depression set in, and eventually I stopped trying to be active - leading to muscle atrophy. Without the support of my friends (and the words of Herman Melville) I don't know if I'd still be around. Eventually, financial circumstances forced me to move back home to Michigan last year. But things have gotten a lot better. I'm trying to eat a nutritious (and rigorous) paleo diet, I'm on tysabri, I'm building up leg strength (with yoga - obviously, amongst other things) and I'm reengaging with electrical engineering and renewable energy. I'm hoping to work full time again in the near future. My dreams are simple: I want to be an engineer (researching renewable energy), eat a healthy paleo diet (not unlike Terry Wahls' plan), float up to handstand in yoga, and read as much as I can. I eventually would like to meet someone who loves yoga, books & classical music. One last thing: My site name - Agathon, is after a greek poet who spoke at Plato's first symposium. I don't know much about him except his name is in Leonard Bernstein's violin concerto: ""Serenade."" Bernstein uses his name to symbolize all forms of love, be it romantic or platonic and it's awesome power to connect. Check out the piece, especially the movement named Agathon.

Between the time of both episodes I started experiencing numerous symptoms of ms including tingling, pain in certain parts of my body and wrestles legs. My bladder also became weak.

Although sexual difficulties can affect the population as a whole, multiple sclerosis (MS) can bring about particular problems for both men and women. Not everyone with MS will experience sexual problems and, as with other MS symptoms, it is impossible to predict who will be affected and how long symptoms may last. One of the reasons for sexual difficulties being more common among people with MS is that sexual arousal, response and orgasm require messages to be sent between the brain and sexual organs, via the spinal cord. If there is MS-related nerve damage in the parts of the brain and spinal cord that are involved, sexual function may be affected. Sexuality – that is, how we think of and express ourselves sexually – may also be affected by MS. Physical symptoms like fatigue and spasms, and psychological factors such as low self-esteem and mood, can also affect sexual activity and desire. Other things in life unrelated to MS, such as having children and getting older, may also play a role. As many factors may be involved, sexual problems vary a great deal between people with MS, and it may be hard to identify a single cause for a particular problem. However, understanding of MS-related sexual problems has improved greatly in recent years, and various treatments are now available. Getting accurate information and communicating openly with your partner and professionals can also help to minimise problems. If difficulties have already developed, there are techniques that can improve communication and understanding, and help you to adapt to new dynamics within your relationships. Many people, both with and without MS, have successful and satisfying relationships despite experiencing sexual difficulties. Useful links and resources:.

Hurtful words might be spoken during a difficult task, doors might be slammed during a disagreement, and shouting in frustration sometimes replaces conversation. Anger and frustration needs to be addressed and healthy outlets need to be developed before angry encounters become physically or emotionally abusive. Abusive Behaviour Is Never Acceptable. Tensions, though, can mount in the most loving of families. While circumstances that produce frustration and anger are often unavoidable, an emotionally damaging or physically aggressive response is not okay. If tensions are mounting, call for a time-out, and call for help. Physical abuse usually begins in the context of giving or getting personal help—the Care Giver might be too rough during dressing or grooming. The person with MS might scratch a Care Giver during a transfer. Once anger and frustration reach this level, abuse by either partner can become more frequent. The dangers of physical abuse are obvious, but emotional abuse is also unhealthy and damaging. Continued humiliation, harsh criticism, or manipulative behaviours can undermine the self-esteem of both Care Givers and care receivers. Therapists and marriage counsellors can help families when tensions get to this level. "

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531911241154671/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	"I am a former Army Ranger, now tech nerd. After leaving the army I ventured in to starting my own business in the Information Security Industry, I hold a Master's Degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology life was great.... Then I noticed numbness in my arm isolated to my ulnar nerve. I thought to myself ok this is very common in my field so suck it up and drive on, after 2 years of numbness I started to feel like my calves were packed full of jelly numbness and tingling in my legs, again suck it up and drive on solider. After two years of pain numbness tingling and fatigue out of the blue I developed Diplopia and thought to myself wow this is kind of scary! After taking it easy for a few days I threw on an eyepatch and continued to work while waiting for my Doctor's Appointment, needless to say I did not make it and ended up at Vanderbilt Hospital, then the pretty glowing spots on my MRI's told the tale, confirmed with an LP, my enemy was identified and given a name. By this time the damage was done. I have since slowed down in life seeing that yes, I was a great provider for my child, but if I am to be a single Dad with MS I needed to give my child what I have while I still have it. I am here to seek fellowship among others who share this battle with me! It has cause my life to change dramatically but not so much that I have lost sight of what I can offer my child and others. I have since closed up shop, and devoted myself to my son and doing what I can to contribute to society in a positive way. Instead of letting this BS called MS get me down I channel it and use it to fight another war, hopefully with as many other people with MS I can enlist! but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint."

It started a few months ago, I woke up one morning with double vision. After a few hours the double vision would go away and I would be dizzy, off balance, nauseous, would have head aches, and extreme fatigue. This lasted for about a month, in that month I had gotten MRIs, they found two lesions on my brain and also gotten a spinal tap and did the evoked visual potential test. My symptoms have gone away, since experiencing symptoms I have quit smoking, started taking vitamins and tried to eat healthier. My neurologist wants me to start meds ASAP and I'm in the process of deciding on one."	"22,34"	3	"patient,speaker"																																																																																				
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694670553262051987/Activity-Feed-:-MS-Connection	"MS probably began affecting my life right after high school, when I first began to lose my balance on little things. I was a little over weight, so my mind probably assumed it to that. I knew what I wanted to do, and I figured that by enlisting with the Air Force, my balance would improve while I lost weight. But a few years went by, and before I knew it, I was only a few pounds shy now for enlisting. This would be around may 2012 when I decided to get a membership to a gym as well as using the insanity workout. BIG mistake. I finished one month of insanity before I decided to just go to the gym. Another couple of weeks passed by when I had my first major fall. Everyone here knows what fall I'm talking about: the one where you're doing something, and for one reason or another, you're on the floor. Nothing hurt, so I checked out both of my ankles, as well as the muscles in my legs before I let my body rest for a few days. It didn't get better, but being a guy also brings bring prideful. I shrugged off my slowly worsening limp as being just a workout injury, telling my family, friends, and coworkers that it would heal if I just rested up. But my mother wouldn't have that. She noticed that I would walk next to the walls, park as close as I could to wherever I was going, and she even noticed when I would pause before walking over a curb. Needless to say a tour of doctors soon followed. The family doctor was first, followed by an orthopedist, then a sports doctor specializing in foot injuries, but they didn't have the right answer. I received a sports brace, which helped, but now I was dragging my foot on the floor. We finally went to see a neurologist. He tested my nerves, sent me for a spinal tap, and finally the MRI. My mom, being as she is, was looking all over the Internet for the answer. I remember what she said. ""You might have multiple scoliosis, "" and I almost laughed. I wanted to tell her that I passed that test in school, but my mind knew better. I knew she meant multiple sclerosis, and I knew she was right. We received the news December 4th, and I knew that I would not be able to join any branch. It was a hollow Christmas for me, but my mind was working out its new plan. I loved writing, and my hand rekindled its relationship with the pen. I decided that if I couldn't enlist, I would write books, and eventually, after they get published, I want to show the world that when one door closes, another one has opened; you just have to find it. Eventually, I would love to create an organization that helps people with MS achieve their dreams, no matter how big or small. I joined this community because my mind and my heart still don't agree that I have MS, and the people that I know don't really understand what it is like. I don't want sympathy/empathy/pity, I want understanding. They try, but having MS is like coming back from war; you can't understand it if you haven't experienced it."

I went to my eye doctor to see if I just needed a new prescription for my glasses. The scariest thing she said was ""you have unexplainable eye loss."" From there I went to see an optimologist who said the same thing and brought up the idea of possibly having MS. She ordered that I have a brain MRI as well as blood work done. A few days later I was diagnosed with MS. I now go to an MS specialist who has me on Gilenya. I haven't been able to finish my semester due to the Optic Neuritis which honestly sucks because everyone is on summer vacation and I am stuck trying to finish my semester.

Thanks for responding, :( I am trying so hard to relax my bf is trying to help too. i was doing great then my heel tingle is getting worse, it keeps coming and going. its not numb. and my muscles are sore in random spots. im praying its just from my chemo but the whole thing is just bothering/depressing me. trying to breath! You can and you must find your calm, keep trying!! Fight your anxiety because it's making you think the worst without a good enough reason, your headspace is spinning and bringing you down, depression and or anxiety will make any one feel a million times worse....call a therapist, call a help line, call a friend, call anyone you know who will distract you and. help you find a calmer headspace! Keep breathing..... I’ve calmed down a bit :( Finally went to my appointment - He is sending me for bloodwork for my thyroid, b12, calcium magnesium ect. He said 99 percent of the time these things are anxiety, then also tested my strength and asked about vision and balance issues ect. He didn’t have much to say about MS only that there is a lot of other things to look for first. IF my levels come back normal idk what would be next. When a mental health causation like 'anxiety' is high on your potential causes list, it's typical to get a mental health assessment so a M/H causation can be ruled out (or in) just like any other potential medical condition as part of the diagnostic process. It's in anyone's best interest to get a mental health assessment if or when a neuro is already mentioning mental health causation at the first appointment... Keep in mind that with your mental health and cancer history what your dealing with is very unlikely to do with a neurological condition like MS, general blood tests will rule out or in most obvious causes and if they're all normal, your neuro may consider running more specific neurological related tests eg brain and spinal MRI's, various nerve conductor tests etc. In general it's estimated that only around a third of neuro consults turn out to be neurological related, a third mental health related and a third are all the other medical conditions that also mimic neurological symptoms.... your neuro is likely telling you that what you have described experiencing is 99% of the time mental health related. Thank you :) Well he’s actually an internist i haven’t yet seen a nuero. I’m just finding it so hard to believe that twitching ect is anxiety but I guess the more i think about it it is believable. My bloodwork was all in range besides a slightly elevated thyroid. He doesnt seem concerned but is having me back on the 17th. I also found a new therapist so we’ll see how that goes. I’m just not sure what to do about more testing, if i should drop it, i feel like i am so worried about MS its consuming me not having answers. It may be harder for you to believe and accept anxiety can and does cause physically symptoms simply because that is exactly what happen's with the health anxiety types of mental health issues... I would highly recommend you take a proactive step back and focus on what you absolutely know to be true before you consider getting any unrelated tests done.... you have a history of struggling with health anxiety which you acknowledge started before and has continued after your cancer battle, so regardless of anything else it is definitely in your current (and future) best interest to focus your attention on understand and pursuing mental health support and treatment options because in this moment in time your health anxiety is seriously effecting your life! Focus on getting your mental health situation under control before anything else because only then will you be able to make clear and informed choices and not choices driven by your health anxiety......"

Chronic fatigue... Sore and painful or tender joints, particularly knee, hips, wrist, hands, thumbs and first two fingers on hands... Brain fog, memory loss, confusion... Muscle aches, body pain, that can come and go... Headaches, sometimes severe, sometimes daily, some that don`t respond to medication...

Polyps on colon, or colon cancer... Been told you may have fibromyalgia, MS, Lupus, or Lyme disease... but dr.s can`t quite pinpoint the cause of your symptoms or tests for these show negative... You need to consider the common and genetic disorder called Hereditary Hemochromatosis... otherwise known as Iron Overload. Iron is a toxic metal that builds to excess in the bodies of people who for genetic reasons load iron from birth instead of getting rid of excess iron. This creates iron toxicity, which in turn, does damage to multiple organs, tissues and joints. Even small amounts in excess of what our bodies needs causes damage and is not optimal for overall good health, leading to a host of other diseases, immune system compromise, free radicals that encourage cancer growth and leave you vulnerable to fighting off viruses such as Hepatitis. Early detection is key, and doctors are missing the important early warning signs, INSTEAD, looking for what they have been taught in medical training to look for, the three CLASSIC symptoms which are END STAGE... cirrhosis, diabetes related to liver cirrhosis, and bronze skin (ever tan). Latest research has shown that these three classic symptoms are by then too late, and patient has irreversible organ and tissue damage and joint degenerationby this point of diagnosis that cannot be resolved. IF, HOWEVER, the iron overload symptoms are detected early, many of the disease manifestations and subsequent problems can be avoided, with normal life expectancy. The longer left undetected, and thus untreated, the more compromised a person`s body, immune system and body functions become, leading to shorter life expectancy and death. Liver cirrhosis, diabetes, cancers, and arthritis can be PREVENTED if iron overload is detected in the early stages. Who are affected... This is usually a genetic mutation found predominantly in people of European descent, Irish and Scottish seems to be affected the most, but French, and UK and Australia have high prevelance. In Ireland, the number is 1in 3 or 4 are carriers of one or two mutations of the HFE gene, and will develop symptoms. Some with the mutation can also be healthy carriers, never becoming symptomatic, but pass it on to their children, or their sibling may develop symptoms, while others won`t. Main thing is, if someone suspects they may have iron overload, they need to get checked, it is a simple blood test, and if diagnosed then all first-degree relatives need to be tested. This can help all family members with early detection. Women are affected as much as men, however men show signs sooner, and are diagnosed sooner than women due to the fact that women menstruate and give birth, and so natural blood loss every month results in less iron accumulation than men. So men are diagnosed usually in their 40`s and 50`s and women 10-15 years later, usually after menopause. But men and women who iron load will begin to exhibit early warnings signs, sometimes in teens and early 20`s, doctors just don`t attribute it to iron overload, but often diagnose the often unspecific symptoms as something else, or in the presence of `normal`` blood panels and routine blood work they prescribe either pain killers for the symptomatic pain or anti-depressants for the symptoms they attribute to depression or other neurological issues. Parkinson`s, Alzheimers, MS, cancers, all have links to iron overload, and new studies can show the link to these common disorders and conditions. Dr. Zamboni has been a recent pioneer into the MS and iron link, curing his wife and many others of MS by restoring normal blood flow to and from brain and removing iron that was stored and blocked in the brain by vein blockages. Once the iron is cleared out of brain, and healthy levels restored, the MS and symptoms have disappeared, even the brain lesions. It is exciting and breakthrough findings like this that have given MS sufferers a ray of hope that they no longer have to have a life long sentence of suffering and progressive debilitation. Some organs that iron loads onto causing co-disease... pituitary gland, thyroid, pancreas, liver, heart, brain... Some tissues affected are intestines, soft connective tissues, muscles... Some joints affected are hips, knees, wrists, hands, and thumb and first two fingers on hand in particular. Some common cause of death related to damage from iron overload... Congestive heart failure. Colon cancer...among many more. What tests do you need... You need to ask for screening for iron overload, which includes serum ferritin, transferrin saturation %, TIBC or UIBC, and serum iron. Also it is a good idea to get your liver enzymes checked, as this will determine if there is liver damage present. Elevated liver enzymes are a red flag for physicians to check further into root causes, iron overload being one. I can help with questions, I can help direct where to research and how to consult with your doctor. I hope this forum will help someone with their unanswered questions and lead to information... with information and sharing we can get to the bottom of this common and rarely diagnosed genetic disorder. Good health wishes to all, and I am here any time to answer any questions, and what I don`t know I can suggest research, and I am not a dr. just someone who has investigated this disorder because of love for my husband who was recently diagnosed and because of his diagnosis I found my own iron overload at the early stage."

I feel bad for you, but you know, I have a couple ideas t. What if your suspicion for ms is taking you the wrong direction? I will give you 5 different possibilities, each of them consistent with many of your symptoms- to a degree- as causative factors or co-factors. 1. Ovarian-Hypothalamic-Thyroid Axis imbalance. 2. Adrenal fatigue stage 2 or stage 3. 3. Hypothyroidism (likely secondary). 4. Pathogenic Mycoplasma infection and /or co-infection. 5. Lymes disease/ Neuroborreliosis. All of the above are very difficult to diagnose and treat through conventional doctors with the exception perhaps in some simple cases of hypothyroidism and early stage lyme disease. If you want to consider doing some research for these, I wouldn't mind to. offer you some guidance, should you find that some of these possibilities. resonate with you. Sorry, things haven't improved for you, but hang in there and please keep in touch. By the way, I have lost touch with Maria, the founder of this group. Have you had any exchange with her on the forum, perhaps at the ms community? I have looked up all those you listed. None of them even come close to what my symptoms are as they have way more symptoms that I dont even have. I have been tested multiple times using different types of test for thyroid problems and have had every lyme disease test ran that you can possible think of having ran. the only one i really cant find anything on is the first one. I will say that I dont live a stressful life at all. I am easy going and roll with the flow. I get worked up here and there but that is usually only dealing with these doctors. I have not been in touch with Maria. I had given up hope for awhile with this formn as it doesnt seem like anyone posts in it anymore. My bowel problems they believe are either coming from celiacs or IBS I have an appt in may to be seen about that. You don't need to wait for your appt. Just do a gluten-free diet challenge for a few weeks. You will know if you experience improvement, but just be aware that the effects of gluten can linger around for many months, after you eliminate gluten from your diet. Many items, like shampoo, play-doe, salad dressings. sauces, soups etc. contain gluten. Just look up online the list. It's long! Many conditions may present just a few of the symptoms. with one person, while others may suffer a wider spectrum of symptoms from the same disease, as each person's constitution is different and it also depends on their genotype and phenotype. For any type of hypothyroid, whether secondary or sub-clinical, the compromised cellular energy may affect any part of a persons body, even with all the standard serum tests returning negative for hypothyroid. In adrenal fatigue, the one thing to watch out for is hidden stress, something that we may not aware of at all, as it is not necessarily. a conscious process. For mycoplasma infections and co-infections which can target any part of your body with just a few symptoms or cause severe illness where one can become bedridden, you may want to search Dr. Garth Nicolson here at medhelp. He's a regular contributor and the top expert in this field. Most doctors don't have a clue about pathogenic mycoplasma and most tests cannot detect them. The OAT axis imbalance would be a stronger possibility if you had ovarian. hormonal and gynecological issues in the past in addition to ongoing fatigue and weakness. It may be somewhat linked also to low adrenal function. To really test accurately for this, only a holistic endocrinologist can help you with that, since conventional endos don't recognize such imbalances,. until they become crisis! Best of luck and I hope you find some answer soon."

I mean I get you, I know what it's like when medical doctors give you late/wrong diagnosis for years, then you get paranoid about anything that can go wrong. It kind of shattered my psyche when all my health issues started because I realized how fragile it all is and how little we know in science in regards to neuro stuff. But lets look at the facts: You're on multiple neuroleptic meds and your symptoms are relatively minor. People can randomly develop neuro stuff alone. Ataxia, dystonia, akathisia, so on and so forth. Many of the above are also part of an umbrella of symptoms for stuff like PD and ALS or MS. But you don't showcase any of the classic signs if either. Go to the ALS message board and ask. Your tremors don't resemble PDs at all. And ALS starts with muscle weakness, like you can't pick up a pitcher of water, you drop your glass of water type muscle weakness. All the symptoms you are displaying are also symptoms that can be caused both by and from tolerance/interdose withdrawals of benzos/ADs. Further there's literally no concrete tests for diagnosis most all this stuff. So doctors will go off the symptoms most of the time, and you don't showcase them enough. Is it possible you are in the very early stages of PD where it's not advanced enough to showcase the classic signs? But there's literally 1) no way to tell until such a time and 2) nothing you can do about it regardless. So I would suggest you stop fixating and being obsessive compulsive because no answer is going to be satisfactory to you. Just take care of your health, increase your D by sun exposure or supplements. Do at least some light exercise everyday, and avoid a lot of sugar. These things are helpful for everyone, and especially so for people with things like PD, so just cover your bases. maybe try to get off your meds, and be content to know that's all you can do right now, and that's all you can know right now. I've accepted my muscle tensions at some form of dystonia/extreme RLS for now, because there's literally nothing I can do about it except takes meds which I don't want to. I've gotten my remeron usage almost gone, and after an initial stage of super anxiety and paranoia, I feel better about it. My sleep is still shit, but some nights are increasing towards tolerable. You can just take it one day at a time, but obsessing and fixating to your level isn't going to help you better, nor is knowing. Also the fact that you said some stuff come and went, makes me think even more it's the meds. I had the same thing with benzos and remeron. Coming off benzos I hate all kinds of crazy shit, neuro, stomach, sleep, etc. Remeron was different but also bad."																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715562167157523166/medical-marijuana	"National Pain Foundation. Alternative and Complementary. Marijuana and Pain Management. By: Bill McCarberg, M.D. Millions of people in the United States suffer from chronic pain, and much of that suffering cannot be relieved adequately by existing treatments. Patients are in desperate need of new pain management approaches. Cannabinoid medicines appear very promising, although the subject often is obscured by controversy, prejudice, and confusion in part because cannabinoids have some relation to the cannabis plant – also known by the slang term marijuana. What scientific reasons do doctors have to think that cannabinoids actually work? Do they provide genuine symptom improvement, or do patients become intoxicated and merely think that their symptoms are reduced? Basic research conducted over the past 20 years provides us with many answers. In the early 1990s, researchers identified the cannabinoid receptor system. This system is found in some of the most primitive animal forms on earth – it is also the most widespread receptor system in the human body. The cannabinoid receptor system has two types of receptors:. CB1 receptors are found primarily in the brain, spinal cord, and periphery. CB2 receptors are on the immune tissues. Specific molecules (called endocannabinoids) are produced by the body that interact with these CB1 and CB2 receptors, much like endorphins interact with the body's opioid receptor system. These findings initiated a new era of scientific interest and research in cannabinoids. Numerous studies have now established that cannabinoids help lessen pain and affect a wide range of symptoms and bodily functions. Such research has also demonstrated that cannabinoids may work together with opioids to enhance their effectiveness and reduce tolerance. This body of research has allowed cannabinoids to be informally classified into three types:. endocannabinoids (produced by the body). phytocannabinoids (produced by the cannabis plant). synthetic cannabinoids (produced in the laboratory). Each type is being studied aggressively, but because endocannabinoids are quickly metabolized and probably cannot be patented, they have not yet been researched in humans. What progress is being made toward developing cannabinoids as prescription pain relievers? Some cannabinoids are unstable and many are insoluble in water, which makes them difficult to research and turn into modern medicines. Patients react very differently to cannabinoids. Data from recent clinical trials are encouraging, but somewhat mixed. Looking closely at the results suggests that composition and delivery route (i.e., how a medicine is administered) are extremely important to the viability of cannabinoid medicines. The Delivery Route. When taken orally, cannabinoids are not very well absorbed and often have unpredictable effects. Patients often become sedated or have intoxication-like symptoms when tetrahydrocannabinol (THC – the primary psychoactive cannabinoid in cannabis) is metabolized by the liver. A small number of studies with Marinol (synthetic THC in sesame oil in a gelatin capsule) and Cesamet (synthetic THC analogue) have shown some effectiveness in pain relief, but optimal doses that relieve pain often cannot be achieved because of unpleasant psychologic side effects. Inhaling cannabinoids, especially THC, also may cause problems for many patients. Blood levels rise suddenly and then drop off sharply. This rapid on-off effect may produce significant intoxication, particularly in patients who are new to cannabinoids. This may pose the risk of abuse potential. Smoking cannabis produces this effect, which is the very reason that recreational users prefer the inhaled route. Patients, however, generally wish to avoid psychologic effects, and it is unclear how difficult it might be to find a dosing pattern that enables them to have pain control without side effects. A new product, called Sativex, was approved by Health Canada in June 2005 for marketing as an adjunctive medicine for central neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. Adjunctive therapy means taking two or more medications to help control pain. Sativex has a different delivery system – an oromucosal/sublingual spray absorbed by the lining of the mouth – that, according to the manufacturer, generally allows patients to gradually work up to a stable dose at which they obtain therapeutic pain relief without unwanted psychologic effects. In the United States, Sativex is being studied in large randomized trials in cancer pain that has not been adequately relieved by opioids. Three early and six pivotal controlled studies in the United Kingdom demonstrated positive results treating chronic pain of various origins including neurologic pain, various symptoms of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer pain. Initial results show improvement in pain for more than one year despite lack of effectiveness of the opioids. Common adverse effects of Savitex have included complaints of bad taste, stinging, dry mouth, dizziness, nausea or fatigue. Additional research also may uncover other ways of avoiding the problems associated with oral or inhaled delivery. Ajulemic acid, a synthetic cannabinoid, binds to both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, and has shown benefit in a small neuropathic pain trial. It may have reduced psychologic effects and is being studied for the treatment of interstitial cystitis. The Interplay of Cannabinoids. The use of herbal cannabis – usually smoked – has received considerable media attention since California and Arizona passed ""medical marijuana"" initiatives in 1996. Despite numerous anecdotal reports of effectiveness, very few controlled studies have been published in the pain area. Little is known about the number of patients who actually experience some degree of benefit or side effects. Furthermore, herbal cannabis is neither standardized nor monitored for quality. The cannabinoid content can vary a great deal, and cannabis sold at dispensaries may be contaminated with pesticides or mold. Dosing is uncertain, depending on the preparation or method of use. So-called ""vaporizers"" do not eliminate all the contaminants. Without clinical trial data and an assurance of product quality, physicians lack the information necessary to assist patients in making informed therapeutic decisions. Both the FDA and Institute of Medicine have stated that there is no future for herbal cannabis as a prescription medicine. Nevertheless, there may be some truth to the idea that there is pain relief potential in phytocannabinoids (plant-based cannabinoids) and that such potential may be affected by the interaction of THC with other botanical components, particularly with other cannabinoids. Modern strains of cannabis have been bred to maximize the THC at the expense of all other cannabinoids, most of which do not have psychologic effects. Some of those cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD), have been demonstrated to have important therapeutic value, particularly on pain and inflammation. The possibilities for cannabinoid medicines are very promising, and much exciting research is proceeding at a rapid pace. As new FDA-approved cannabinoid products become available, physicians and patients will have a solid scientific foundation from which to assess their appropriateness. Hopefully, robust scientific data will soon allow cannabinoids to take their place – along with opiates and other pain relievers – in the modern medical supply for treating chronic pain. Bill H.

I am only 35 years old married with 2 children a son of 13 and a daughter of 11. It has already started to affect their lives. the things that I should be able to do with them, I have a hard time weather it is because of fatige, depression or pain and I feel guilty because of it and dont know what to do about it. Also I am not able to be intimate with my wife most of the time because of ms I think she sometimes feels it is because of her wich it is not. I love my wife very much, and very much want to be close to her. what I would say to someone with ms, is that I understand when everybody else may not. I would do anything to create a world without MS but not sure what I could do."

I have found out some recent symptoms turned to be relapse, and symptoms that started in 09 that were over looked as equilibrium issues look to be MS, Id get pregnant just after symptoms started and was said that pregnancy put the symptoms in remission and then like clockwork 3-6months after delivering they would reappear. I ve been to the er and dr several times with vertigo med or migraine meds thrown at me that didnt help. er dr did ct that came back within normal limits but said he couldn't do much testing further but was suspicious of MS, advised me to follow up with a neurologist. No insurance so just said its nothing and went about my life. July 2014 i delivered a baby as a gestational surrogate, feeling great and them bam i was hit by a semi truck. End of Oct I would wake up and go to sleep with my world spinning around me, blinding migraines. In the beginning of Nov Weakness, tingling in my left arm hand and leg, fatigue, balance issues. slurred speech and hard getting words out slowly progressed over a week. Visiting the ER was not to much help. test came back normal, neuro said see a neuro specialized in MS get more MRIs done at a better facility suggest spinal tap and few other test since my MRIs arent showing enhanced lesions. He said hes had many patients who have MS that lesions didnt show for many years even after many years of symptoms it all depends on the type of MS etc. So here I am trying to learn how to handle my new body and mind I am living in. Trying to find a way to pay for my medical test and dr visit to see a neurologist at USF. I am normally a very happy overly active busy person. I am detailed organized and clean freak. I can hardly drive 90% of the time, Im constantly walking into walls fall, my mind is spacey out of it confused feeling, exhausted weak my hand is stiff, my legs get tingly, new muscle spasms randomly are showing up on my face and body. I feel like so fragile its not a good feeling, when Ive always been so independent and strong minded/willed, to be this fragile weak incoherent person. My husband doesnt full graps this disease, I try my hardest to not let him see how i am really feeling some days. I feel like a foreign citizen and no one around me speaks the same language as me. I can say that I have gained a new perspective and learned to let the little things that would normally send me into a full blown panic attack go, because the stress is not needed and no good for my healthy. I am learning to enjoy my children more. things can change in a flash before your eyes. Things that were simple task that i could do wiht my eyes closed or sleeping have turned to be hard to get through. I am trying to learn as much as I can about MS, finding a good support system. I am trying to find resources to help me finish my official diagnosis so that I can begin some treatment and grasp the new Me."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715573477081044860/Stuff-could-always-be-worse	"I share a guest post from Chipper at Healthline.com. This seems hopeful to me when more medications are in the pipeline for MS..... You decide for yourself..... Pharmaceutical company, Merck KGaA, has acquired exclusive worldwide rights to PI-2301, which is an experimental drug for multiple sclerosis. The drug has already completed Phase II clinical trials. The PI-2301 was previously owned by Peptimmune, a company what went bankrupt earlier this year. Merck, a German company, had another oral multiple sclerosis drug cladribine, which failed to make the jump to market earlier and was canceled. The head of global development, Susan Herbert said, “Over the years we (Merck) have continuously worked on developing innovative treatment options that meet the individual needs of people living with multiple sclerosis.” Before it was bought by Merck KGaA, PI-2301, was a second generation originally by Teva's Copaxone. It was thought to enhance the regulated response immune system. Earlier this year Merck recently acquired the PI-2301, which is due to lose all patent protection in 2014, and generic companies can start competing for business. Merck is already facing generic companies, but still managed to make $3.3 billion last year in 2010. The PI-2301is designed to improve the regulatory response of the immune system, which is one of the main causes of multiple sclerosis. Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is a disabling disorder. The autoimmune disorder affects the brain and spinal cord and mistakenly attacks and damages healthy body tissue. Multiple sclerosis affects more women than men most commonly between the ages of 20 and 40, but symptoms can be seen at any age. The myelin sheath is damaged and the nerve impulses are stopped or slowed down completely. The PI-2301 works to control the pathogenic autoimmune response which would prevent some mistakenly destroyed myelin sheath. Merck already makes a drug to treat multiple sclerosis called Rebif. Peptimmune, now bankrupt, had two additional MS drug candidates, which are ready to enter Phase I clinical trails. One drug, ARX 424, is a long acting interferon and the other drug ATX-MS-1467 is an immune-tolerizing agent. The PI-2301, has already been approved last year in Australia and Russia, but is facing issues in other European countries."

It's been a rough road, a big moment in my life was when I found out my wife was having online relations with another man, we argued, I had just begun taking one of the oral meds for my ms. Well I had many prescriptions in my medicine cabinet because of the back injury, ms, depression etc.... She began dumping my meds in the toilet, when all was said and done 7 scripts gone and I was going to jail. 5 days later went home reconciled with her, jump forward to a year ago, we sell our home in Northern California and move up to gods country Washington to be closer to her sister, one year later she takes off and she is now living with another man. I have always told her she would not be taking care of me because of health issues when we get old. A week after she leaves my back spasms and I have to literally crawl on my knees back into the house before I could stand up again. It's hard now I have two German Shepard dogs who are incredible at shedding all over, sweep it on a Monday do it again on weds. And a step son who I've raised since he was 5, he is in Jerusalem for schooling for missionary work, and an 18yo daughter who goes to Seattle in two weeks to join the navy. Wow, that's a lot the thought of being alone after 15 yrs is a bummer, but worse yet is when my back flared up I really coulda used a hand. I just can't train the dogs to do the dishes. They have only a few demands, food, play, potty. I love them though."

In July of 2011 I woke up with blurred vision in my right eye. After meeting with my Eye Dr he sent me to an eye specialist The same day to conclude I had optic neuritis and with in 24 hours I was In an MRI machine and was meeting with the MS clinic within 48 hour. I got my diagnosis with in six months. Since my first cause of optic neuritis . I have had a few more relapses. I got optic neuritis in my left eye ( both eyes have cleared up but damage to each nerve was done) I have also had a relapse where my eyes were not in sync with each other and there was a delay in my vision. My worst relapse by far was back from October 2013 to the end of December 2013. After weeks of being sick and finally the Neurologist deciding to do an MRI to conclude what was wrong they found a lesion on the base of my brain and my spinal cord that was telling my body I didnt need to eat, so for 8 weeks I didn't. I went down a large amount of wait but had little to no energy at all and was in a semi disabled state unable to do tasks for myself. I also was having other symptoms related to this relapse that included tingling in my feet, vertigo, and urine hesitancy. I did steroids for this relapse and it seemed to clear up pretty good but took a solid month or two for me to get back to my Normal self. I have relapses here and there and am currently in another one right now where both my hands are numb and it has been going on for about 4 weeks but My neurologist doesnt want to do treatment because I am not in pain So I am trying to live with it but it is defiantly a constant reminder that I have MS and its not going away. I dont know anyone who has MS so I am hoping that this site will help me find people to talk to about symptoms I am having and other peoples story's as well as struggles."

I use a cane now because I trip/fall frequently and I have tried different types of treatments.

We also welcome your suggestions for improving the site. I know MS Discovery well--I find it an excellent source of information that I use regularly! Paul M. Matthews, OBE, MD, DPhil, FRCP, FMedSci. Edmund J. and Lily Safra Professor of Translational Neuroscience and Therapeutics. Head, Division of Brain Sciences. Department of Medicine. Imperial College, London. I LOVE your site! I am a very experienced UK MS Specialist Nurse, caring for people with MS over decades, but have just discovered the wealth of updated, and shared, knowledge your site has to offer. I so wish I had had you 30 years ago. Thank you. I am inspired. Dear Editor,. I am writing to inform you that I have highlighted some content from the MS Discovery forum on a recent blog post. The post, which covers MS-related blogs and other sites that are particularly accessible to scientific laypeople (patients!) can be found here: http://treetownchem.blogspot.com/2014/03/making-sense-of-multiple-sclerosis.html. I've only discovered the MSDF in the past few days but can't wait to read more of this excellent journalism. I am an inorganic chemist by trade. Since my mother was diagnosed a few years ago I have been struggling to get the vocabulary needed to understand the MS research literature, but the MSDF looks like it distills the ideas very effectively. Thank you for creating a great community! Jimmy Brancho, Inorganic Chemistry Ph.D. Candidate, University of Michigan. MSDF Senior Science Journalist Carol Cruzan Morton covered the American Society of Neurochemistry (ASN) meeting in Long Beach, California in March 2014. Here's a message ASN meeting manager Sheillah Jewart sent to all of the society's members:. At the recent ASN meeting in Long Beach, you may have noticed Carol Morton, a Senior Science Journalist from MS Discovery, conducting interviews and attending the sessions. Here is her first article and stay tuned for other stories from the meeting. ""Rare Family Cluster of MS Reveals New Clues,"" based on talks from the LKB1 session at the recent ASN meeting in Long Beach. You can link directly to the story at http://www.msdiscovery.org/news/new_findings/10319-rare-family-cluster-ms-reveals-new-clues MS Discovery Forum is a growing dynamic scientific community of researchers and physicians. Check out MSDF news and resources and sign up (it’s free) to comment on stories and papers, to post meeting announcements and jobs, and to help us shape the site so it serves the diverse needs of the MS research community. It's all in the interests of speeding progress toward new and better treatments for -- or prevention of -- multiple sclerosis. (Your comments also help show site engagement to potential funders, which will help ensure MSDF's ongoing support and success.). Sheillah Jewart, American Society of Neurochemistry. One of the articles Carol Morton wrote from the ASN meeting resulted in a nice comment from a researcher quoted in the article:. Thanks Carol for this attractive looking and handsomely written piece!!! Everybody is commenting on how well it is written and how good the article looks. So far one potential collaborator re scientific experiments whom we already met at ASN meeting. That's good. Anne Boullerne, University of Illinois, Chicago. Thank you very much for . . . alerting me to your excellent website. I really enjoyed reading through some of the very well written and concise summaries of papers on the site. It will certainly be one of my go to sites in keeping up to date. David Paling, MB ChB, University College, London. “I am very impressed ... a really useful and interesting site.”. Dr. Alasdair Coles, Senior Lecturer, University of Cambridge. “The site looks very good... The articles are very high quality and I congratulate you and your writers.”. Tim Vollmer, MD, Professor and Director of Clinical Research, University of Colorado. “I’ve had a look at your site and must congratulate you on such a fine job ... This will be a very valuable resource for the MS community.”. Juan Carlos Lopez, Editor, Nature Medicine. “The MSDF is a lifeline for those of us who struggle to keep up with the vast array of new research findings in multiple sclerosis - particularly in areas where we don't have particular expertise. The articles' brevity, and their clear and engaging style, fit perfectly with the schedules of busy researchers. Over time, this model should increase the relevance of our work.”. Daniel S. Reich, MD, PhD, Chief, Translational Neuroradiology Unit, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. “The multiple sclerosis field is substantially more difficult at this moment to try to wrap one’s arms around. But the wonderful thing about this moment in time for MS is that there are a good number of drugs that may alter the natural history of the disease. It is probably a generation-long task to work them all into a logical, coherent therapeutic armamentarium. I think that [MSDF] will help in that process by being an honest broker … an authentically important goal.”. Dr. Richard Ransohoff as quoted by Science Translational Medicine in an article about MS Discovery Forum . “Your article [on imaging] is excellent. You’ve covered tremendous ground and spoken to many well-chosen experts to balance your reporting. This piece really covers ‘MS Imaging in 2012,’ and I’ll recommend it to students and residents who want a quick and comprehensive overview of the field.”.

Developed by Khawai . Understanding and analyzing the design of past clinical trials is a key factor in planning future trials. This visualization details the design of 88 clinical trials with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports published between 1993 and 2014. It makes it easy to see which of five key measurements were reported in each trial and when during the course of that trial those measurements were made. The measurements are:. * Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). * Gadolinium-enhancing lesion (GdEnh Lesion). * T2-hyperintense lesion volume (Volume T2). * Brain Volume. * Combined Active Lesion (CAL). The top chart combines information from all the trials in each of the four phases. The size of each circle is a function of the number of trials reporting this measurement. Switching between phases will allow you to visualize the differences in the frequency and the type of data available. The bottom chart displays information on individual trials.

Halliday AM, McDonald WI, Mushin J. 1972 May 6; 1(7758):982-5. PMID: 4112367. Suggested By Alastair Compston and alasdair coles. In their 1972 study, Ian McDonald and Martin Halliday showed that visual evoked potentials can detect past episodes of optic neuritis, and thus introduced a non-invasive test to assist in the diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis. Halliday had been measuring evoked potentials in people with multiple sclerosis for the previous decade; meanwhile, McDonald and Tom Sears had shown that demyelinating lesions impair nerve conduction. This study found delayed evoked potentials in 19 patients with unilateral optic neuritis for as long as 5 years after their vision returned to normal, suggesting that “the technique described here provides a useful objective test for previous damage to the optic nerve.” The authors went on to find abnormal evoked potentials in patients with a previous history of optic neuritis and also in patients with no history of optic neuritis. They later proposed diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis that incorporated visual evoked potentials. To date, the only clinical diagnostic test that can demonstrate that a central neurological lesion is demyelinating is the cortical evoked potential, of which the pattern-evoked visual potential is by far the most sensitive and robust."

Association for Research in Nervous and Mental Diseases (ARNMD) vol 2. New York: Herber, 1921: 8–19. Suggested By George Ebers. This was the first systematic study showing that the geography of MS had unexplained irregularity. Davenport became somewhat controversial later because of his interests and studies in eugenics (a scientific zeitgeist among his contemporaries in educated circles). He studied the occurrence of MS in U.S. World War I veterans and showed the high prevalence around the Great Lakes, something that was attributed to the Scandinavian origins of much of this population at the time. This continues to the present to a degree, c.f. the Swedes of Minnesota and the Finns around the northern lakeshores, e.g., Thunder Bay. Later, the migration of Norwegians to the U.S. Northwest, making up some 50% of the migrants in the mid-19 th century, would show up in the geography of veterans with MS. The highest U.S. rates by state continue to be in Washington state. The U.S. VA records proved grist for John Kurtzke’s mill and his industry and determination was to be most productive, but the use of the veteran’s databases began here and with Beebe (Beebe et al. , 1967) ."

Spasticity is characterised by an increase in tone in a muscle group, so that there is stiffness and resistance as the muscle is moved. In MS, it can impair mobility, produce pain, and significantly impact daily living. Spasticity can increase intermittently (cramping) or increase chronically. Complications from spasticity include pain, joint contractures, frozen joints, impaired bladder or bowel function, skin ulceration, and abnormal postures and falls. In this section we talk about how to best deal with spasticity, a painful symptom that can impact almost every activity of daily living. How is spasticity assessed & treated? Spasticity is measured by the degree of passive resistance to the stretch of muscles around joints, using the Ashworth or modified Ashworth scales. Usually carried out by a Chartered Physiotherapist. Treatment of spasticity involves both medications and physical approaches. Over-treating spasticity can impede mobility.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531460378067515/MS-Ireland--::-Fatigue	"MS Ireland  ::. Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms experienced by people with MS and, for some, it is the symptom that affects them most. Different people have different experiences of fatigue and it can impact on all aspects of life. It can come and go, or change over time and could be one of the first symptoms you experience, or something that appears years later. Fatigue is difficult to explain. In MS, it is not just an ordinary tiredness that people might experience after a hard day’s work or strenuous exercise. Many describe it as an overwhelming sense of tiredness for no apparent reason. Some people become tired after very little activity, or rarely wake up feeling refreshed in the morning. While there is still much to learn about the exact causes of fatigue in MS, many people have found ways to minimise its effects. Health and social care professionals can help with managing fatigue, but because fatigue in MS may have a variety of causes, and affects each person differently, there is no ‘one size fits all’ treatment. Some people may be prescribed drugs, though, for many, a combination of self-management strategies, physiotherapy and exercise helps reduce the impact of their fatigue. Useful links and resources:.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531546298802646/MS-Ireland--::-Symptoms	"MS Ireland  ::. The presence, severity and duration of all MS symptoms vary considerably from person to person. The unpredictable nature of the condition can sometimes make it hard to manage. However, over time, many people begin to notice patterns and triggers to their symptoms, and with appropriate treatment and intervention, many symptoms can be managed quite successfully. Some of the symptoms of MS are immediately obvious. Reduced mobility is often the most visually apparent. Other symptoms such as fatigue , changes in sensation, memory and concentration problems are often ‘hidden’ symptoms and can be difficult to explain to others. No matter what the symptoms are, it is important to alert your GP or Neurologist when a new symptom appears, or an existing symptom changes. Managing symptoms is not just about drug treatments , and many people find a healthy lifestyle also helps. A balanced diet , appropriate exercise and keeping stress at a minimum can give your body and mind the best chance to deal with symptoms. Some people with MS find complementary therapies helpful. Many of these therapies promote wellbeing holistically; the focus being on the person and not just the symptoms. Remember to speak to your doctor first before starting any form of alternative therapy . Managing symptoms is part of the overall management of the effects of MS. Symptoms not only affect the functioning of the body physically, emotionally and cognitively, they can also affect your work, social life and family. It is important that you look at your everyday life and look at any changes you can which will help you manage your MS as successfully as possible.

They are a great source of information and advice. They may also act as a link between hospital, community services and social services. If you have not already been offered an appointment with an MS nurse, you can ask your GP or neurologist for a referral. Occasionally, MS nurses take self-referrals, which means you can ring them directly and ask for an appointment. Ideally, you should be referred to an MS nurse as soon as you are diagnosed. They often become the first point of contact for any concerns about your MS (though a GP should be the person to contact about general health queries). Some of the issues you might contact your MS Nurse about are if you:. Not every hospital in Ireland has an MS nurse.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531548507245983/MS-Ireland--::-Pharmacist	"MS Ireland  ::. Pharmacists provide pharmaceutical care to patients both while they are in hospital and at home. This means the pharmacist can help people with MS get the maximum benefit from the medicines that have been prescribed for them. Pharmacists can also help doctors choose the best medicines and the best way of administering them. The pharmacist will also ensure that people have a continuous supply of their medicines. It is important that people with MS have the right information about their medicines so they can feel confident about taking them, with the minimum number of unwanted side effects and the maximum benefit. During their stay in hospital, people with MS may be visited by the hospital pharmacist and given advice about their medications and how best to take them. When it is time for the person to go home, the hospital pharmacist can help draw-up a plan to ensure that the person with MS, their carers and community pharmacist have all the information they need to ensure the smooth running of any continuing treatment. The community pharmacist will provide ongoing advice and information about the medications, and will liaise with the GP and other community health care providers. A pharmacist can inform and interpret drug or treatment information, so they can help people with MS and their carers by giving an informed opinion about their medicines, including how they may act or interact together and reported or expected side effects. A pharmacist can help to answer any queries that a person with MS may have about their treatment options. While in hospital, the person with MS may see their hospital pharmacist every weekday. Alternatively he/she can ask a nurse to contact the hospital pharmacist and arrange a meeting with them if required. While at home, the person with MS should contact their community pharmacist if they have any problems or queries about their medications. People with MS are automatically entitled to a Long-Term Illness Card. This means that all their medication related to their MS is free. A straightforward application form must be completed to avail of this. More information on how to apply to the Long Term Illness Scheme. Resources and information. The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has produced a Patient Charter that lays out what you should be able to expect from your pharmacist.

As part of the multi-professional team, medical social workers provide skilled psychosocial support to people with MS through counselling and practical assistance. They have expertise in understanding the psychological impact of illness on individuals and can use this information to advise hospital policies which relate to the needs of people with MS. Research has shown that serious illness has a direct impact on the psychological, social, emotional, physical and economic wellbeing of individuals and their families/carers. The medical social worker can identify with the person, their personality traits, coping skills and ways of dealing with the world prior to the onset of the illness. Input from the social worker is invaluable to the neurology team. It enables the team to adapt their style to meet the individual needs of that person. The people themselves can benefit from developing an awareness of their own style of coping and can articulate what is important about the illness and its treatment, come to terms with an often complicated hospital system, and get to know those involved in their care. This is in addition to dealing with strong emotional reactions such as denial, fear, anger, and helplessness. MS can also create many practical and financial problems. Medical social workers intervene with families by addressing both the emotional issues and the practical concerns simultaneously. The Medical Social Work Service provides privacy and confidentiality to people with MS and their families. Medical social workers access a wide-range of services in both the voluntary and statutory sectors. They have an advocacy role in determining the needs of a person with MS and their family’s needs are highlighted and met. They create links and liaise with members of local communities as well as health and social services. Medical social work plays an important role for neurology teams, ensuring that the person with MS is viewed not as an individual entity, but as a person in the context of their overall family and community environment. A person with MS or a family member can access a medical social worker by contacting the Social Worker Department directly in any hospital. Alternatively, they can ask their hospital consultant or a member of the neurology team to make a referral on their behalf.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693250087712843462/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	"I began noticing numbness in my fingertips but I was only seeing a chiropractor for lower back pain. He could not help me. Then a new chiropractor could not give me a decent reason why I could not walk so good after another year. I would get tired after a few blocks. I mentioned it to my primary care doctor and she had me take tests and see many doctors for additional symptoms, but the neurologist could explain my concerns. By this time, I assumed the fatigue had to do with menopause although my walking was stilted and hard. Another year after trying different chiropractors, the one who cured my frozen shoulders tested me and guessed, but could not diagnose. He instead had my doctor send me to another neurologist who gave me a head MRI and spent time explaining my new diagnosis. I've done a great deal of reading, talking to others with MS and worrying about continued employment with increasing problems. I've had to take an early retirement from teaching. I now juice almost daily for energy, use a vibration machine for exercise, started a gluten-free diet which has shown an increase in energy and cognition; I somehow just found this site even though I read the newsletter and magazine the same day I receive it. I keep up with MS sufferers on DailyStrength.com but still feel alienated. This is my first adult year not working and it is weird. I can not get around well but I read mostly bios and other nonfiction, complete crossword puzzles and work-out on Lumosity.com. I generally sleep at least ten hours.

I used to take photos, bike, salsa dance, hike and take long walks, all of which I can no longer do.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531969418564674/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	"I was diagnosed with RRMS when I was 17 years old. My whole left side of my face was numb and I had sever balance problems causing me to fall to my left side. I spent 3 days in the hospital with no idea what was happening to me. I received a spinal tap, and numerous other amounts of testing. I was assigned a neurologist who was a complete joke. He gave me massive amounts of steroids, never actually told me if I had ms or not and eventually he stopped taking my calls. I went from 210 (at 6'2 i was in fairly good shape) all the way to 305 because of the high amounts of steroids. My grandma's friend whose daughter also has ms got me in to see her neurologist. I went to edward's neuroscience institute in Warrenville, Illinois to meet with Dr. Henry Echeverri. He immediately looked at my MRI and said I had active lesions and that he was mos certain I had multiple sclerosis. He had me continue high doses of steroids until I was able to start copaxone. I began copaxone and I absolutely hated the daily injections. The bumps and all the problems associated with the injections made my skin crawl, no pun intended. I was very depressed from the diagnoses and the weight gain and the shots were the icing on the cake. I spent a whole year isolating myself from my family and friends and drank heavily, even knowing how bad it was for my condition. I was still having a fair amount of relapses from the copaxone, partially in my opinion because I would miss doses. My doctor called me and said he wanted me to come in and speak with him. This terrified me, but I went in and met with him. He told me that the lesions were active and had gotten a little bit bigger. He suggested tysabri, which was the best decision I have made. I began tysabri and immediately looked up the medication and researched it from front to back. The side effects as well as the possible brain infection of PML made me hesitant but I accepted the risks. I started tysabri in 2014. I had such a good experience with tysabri. I went 3 and a half years without any relapses and the lesions I had actually began to shrink. This drug was a miracle to me. In January 2016 I had a calcaneal osteotomy on my right foot, because my feet are very flat and caused me agonizing pain when standing. Sure enough 5 months later I had a microdiscectomy (back surgery) on my l4-15. I was ready to commit suicide because the pain was the worst thing I have ever dealt with. I could not get the surgery until May due to me being on crutches from my foot surgery. After having the surgery I was given an unexpected reprieve. I had a whole new outlook on life. It made me realize that things can always be way worse and that my ms was always manageable. I began to work out when my surgeon gave me the okay and I was suggested a low carb diet by my uncle who lost 100 lbs in a year. I had tried many different diets and nothing worked so I figured I had nothing to lose. I lost 22 lbs in the first 2 weeks, and eventually maintained 3 lbs a week. exactly 1 year later i lose 87 lbs and went from 305 to 220. I was ecstatic by my progress and that my ms was in remission for so long. In august of 2017 I began dating my girlfriend who became such a big part of my life. She became a big support system of mine. She even motivated me to continue with my studies and get my degree since I can not work physical jobs anymore. Now in 2018 due to insurance change I had to see a new neurologist and lost my tysabri. It has been 3 months without it and I am starting to feel the effects of it. I will be switching over to gilenya. My current neurologist is a good doctor but getting a hold of him or his assistant is nearly impossible which makes things very complicated. The last 3 months have been a nightmare but I remain optimistic and have a great new job and I am exceeding in my studies."

Went to the ER got an MRI it came back normal, got a referral to see a neurologist. At the appointment with the neurologist he quickly decided (based off the MRI) that my headaches were caused by Occipital Neuralgia. (a condition which the nerves run up to the top of the spinal cord through the scalp called occipital nerves are inflamed). He gave me a nerve block shot and got sent on my way. Flash forward to 4 weeks later. I lost complete vision in my right eye along with numbness in my face. Went to the ER again, did another MRI. This time it came back with 5 lesions. I was rushed up to tge ICU and quickly hooked up to some steroids. I was told they wanted to keep me overnight and in the morning I would be meeting with a doctor. The next morning I met with the same neurologist that diagnosed me with occipital neuralgia. He explained to me that I had the symptoms of MS and they were going to do a spinal tap. A few hours later I had my spinal tap done and found out I wouldn't have my results for a while. My vision wasn't back to normal yet so I was stuck in the hospital for another 2 days. Two weeks (and two days before my daughter's first birthday) I was fully diagnosed with MS."

Bear with me while I tell you a story of addiction first. I am a Respiratory Therapist and I worked nights for a long time. I started suffering from fatigue about 5 years ago. I assumed it was because of working the night shift. A co-worker gave me an Adderall and my life changed for good. I never felt so good. It was the most amazing feeling ever. I had so much energy. I no longer spent all my time in bed. I was on 20mg per day at that point. Then the fatigue started coming back so I went back to the doctor and she upped me to 25mg. That helped for a little while. I went back to my doctor for more. I was increased to 30mg. I was doing well for a few months. But the fatigue came back. So I went back to my doctor and was upped to 30mg twice a day. I was flying high! I got so much done. I was the go to guy at work! My patients loved me and the nurses were so impressed with my work ethic. But then the 60mg wasn't enough anymore. A co-worker of mine was also on Adderall and she would give me some of hers at times. Then instead of asking, I would take her keys, go out to her car and take more Adderall without her knowing. Obviously, this is a bad sign. But I went back to my doctor and asked for 90mg per day. She said no and that I needed to see a psychiatrist first. That was the beginning of the end. The psychiatrist showed me that I was addicted to Adderall. I already knew this but I was in denial. At that point, I was no longer on Adderall. It was a very tough 4 months without it. My wife helped me a great deal through the detox. After about 6 months, I was extremely frustrated with my fatigue. I changed to day shift and took lots of vitamins but nothing helped. I went back to my doctor and I was put on Concerta, which is Ritalin. It helped take the edge off. So a few months ago I started having extreme pain in my right ear. Like someone was sticking an ice pick through it. Two doctors saw no structural problems with my ear. I was referred to a neurologist. She ordered an MRI. I had a bunch of white spots indicating dead cells. I then had a lumbar puncture which confirmed the diagnoses. I had MS! I was happy to finally have a reason for the myriad of problems I'd been having for 5 years. Then I got depressed thinking about my future. As a Respiratory Therapist, I take care of a lot of MS patients. All I could think of was being in a wheel chair and unable to take care of myself. My wife, Toni, told me to snap out of it. And I've been trying to do just that. I've been reading as much as I can and formulating a plan. I just started Copaxone a couple of days ago. It hurts and really makes me itch at the injection site. But hopefully it'll work for me. My initial problem list was fatigue, erectile dysfunction, constipation, spasticity in my arms, depression and the pain in my ear. I believe now that it is all caused by MS. So that's a good thing in a way. I now know what direction to go. Thank you for reading my long story."

Graduate school was stressful enough and my boyfriend and I had just gotten back from a tense holiday break where his family had fought a lot. I was diagnosed quickly, so quickly that I don't think I really got a chance to process what was going on very much at the time. I had a tingling sensation on my skin in the midsection and got diagnosed with a pinched nerve. The sensation quickly spread to my whole body (hands, feet, etc.) and because this happened on the weekend I got myself to the ER. That doctor suggested I see a neurologist because the spreading sensation had a chance of being MS. Our school doctor's office was able to get me an appointment with a neurologist right away, which I am very grateful for. He did tell me he ""really didn't think it was MS"" but we did the MRI anyways. Well, he was wrong! So much of the ""you look fine"" has been part of my experience from the very beginning. When I moved back home to MD I got a copy of my medical records and I could see that the doctor noted that my symptoms were likely caused by anxiety, so I've kind of felt unvalidated in a way from the start. Finishing school was pretty tough with this big rain cloud over me but I did it. I still wonder if I could have done better with my school projects and had a better portfolio if I didn't have MS. I am just now, 4 years later, processing at lot of this hurt, regret and emotions from my diagnosis period. I haven't had an MS attack since my initial diagnosis but have a hard time telling if symptoms I experience are from MS or from something else. I also have had thyroid problems and recently had my thyroid removed to diagnosis nodules that were growing on my thyroid (luckily it wasn't cancer but now, no more thyroid!) I feel like I get pretty tired and down easily and have a hard time picking myself back up. I worry about when things are going to take a turn for the worse and how I will deal with it."

He is truly my best friend and more than I could have ever imagined. We married in May. That December I woke up my arms and legs were completely dead / numb I thought this was strange and thought I may have slept funny, I did some exercises as I got ready for work, to try and get some movement back. The movement didn't come back and I remained numb for roughly a week. Cold was making it worse and I was beginning to lose my balance. I made an appointment with my GP who wasn't much help at first just said to go home and monitor it and if the numbness didn't subside to go back. Worried about the Christmas break approaching I booked back in. I was more firm this time as symptoms had got worse, numbness was making me lose my grip and my balance and coordination was really bad. He then wrote to the neurologist at the hospital and I was told to wait for an appointment to have some further tests. Months past and I still hadn't heard from the hospital, the numbness was coming and going at the stage and my knee was becoming inflamed and felt unsteady to walk on this was made me avoid wearing heels and going out in general. I also started to develop feelings of creepy crawlies under my skin mainly in my back also have shooting / electrical shocks randomly all over my body. I had no idea what this was but after spending a lot of time on Google I diagnosed myself I was 99% sure I had Multiple Scoliosis. The pain is unbearable at times. When my letter finally arrived it was March 2013 they tested my reflexes and my strength etc and said they were sending me for an MRI scan, the reality was starting to sink in and reading up was beginning to scare and upset me. My MRI scan was end of May 2013 the doctor was reluctant in confirming it was MS without doing a Lumbar Puncture. But he showed myself and my husband the scan of my brain and we saw lesions on my brain, which made my heart sink and my eyes welled up. The reality was sinking in I began to shake and wanted more answers the doctor was being very vague. My husband pushed him for answers. And he said in his professional experience it was Multiple Scoliosis but couldn't give us any further information as he want a specialist . And then we had to wait for a lumbar puncture. November 2013 came and I was called to go for the lumbar Puncture. The results look an age and again they confirmed I had RRMS. Finally after a full year I had the answer I already knew. I just don’t know why it took a whole year to get a diagnosis. March 2014 I started using Copaxone. I never ever thought I would be able to inject myself but I was dpoing it. I couldn't cope with the injections or the pain after or the damage it was causing to my body. But I forced myself to continue. In the end I just couldn't continue. The pain was too bad and I managed continue with Copaxone until I could started tecfidera BG12 in February 2015. So now I am 4 weeks in and will keep you all posted :) My biggest hopes and dreams regarding MS is that the firstly find a cure, in this day and age no one should be living with this illness. My Second hope is that everyone with this condition continues to fight it and keep the communication going because talking and educating yourself is so important. On this site we can all help each other. Spreading the word and sharing ideas and making new friends :) I plan to take part in MS walks and continue to spread awareness of this condition all over social media. I believe the lack of knowledge for conditions such as MS is frightening and I wish to educate people. (although I fear may bore people) lol."

With some pretty severe symptoms, I ended up in the hospital for 7 days. With some medication and rehab I was able to return home to pretty good physical function. But I new that there was underlying anxiety. I always knew that knowledge is power. I realized that I needed to get some much needed information about Multiple Sclerosis. I didn't know what this chronic condition was. I joined a peer support group and attended several MS seminars. I've use the internet as a tool, but I always watched which site that I've used to make sure that the site is a legitimate site. I've always tried to eat healthy and exercise. I prefer yoga and walking. Spending time outdoors with my dog is very important to me. I also think that meditation and relaxation techniques are very important for anxiety and stress reduction. I try and get a massage every month. This is something that I put into my budget. I feet that it's important for my health. I work part time and volunteer in my spare time.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693707254751941972/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	"So here's my story! Back in March 2018, I was hospitalized due to an episode of Optic Neuritis. I had been slowly losing my vision in my left eye which by the 12th day led me to the ER. I had no idea why this was happening and after doing an MRI of my brain with/without contrast, there were some lesions that were found on my brain. They ran some blood work and I had very low Vitamin D (amongst other things). This led them to do the lumbar puncture (Spinal Tap). The results from that came back positive for CSF glands (which is from what I understand damage to my Myelin sheath) with all of the contributing factors and what information the Neruo's had in the hospital, they said that there wasn't enough to diagnose me with MS, but to follow up with the reffered Neuro from the hospital and discuss further plans. Waiting 2 1/2 weeks to follow up with the NP was torture. I was laid up at home still not feeling my best while having the lingering thoughts of this being a disease that I may inevitably get diagnosed with and everyone just reminding me to stay positive. The appointment comes and I have all of my questions as well as a log of everything i've physically felt since being discharged from the hospital. The NP explains to me that based on the MRI, Positive LP, Low vitamin D and optic Neuritis that this will more than likely progress to an MS DX and that we should start on preventative medication. She went over the different types and the potential side effects and sent me off to get blood work to check my levels and said she will review ""my case"" with the director or Neurology and she will determine if she thinks Medication at this time was a good call but that she was 99% sure that thats what the Director will say. Then, I get a call from the NP a day after my appointment stating that she wants me to go get another MRI of my Thorastic Spine to check if there were lesions because this wasn't done in the hospital. I go and get the MRI of my spine and then have another follow up appointment scheduled for the following week. Now, in my mind- this woman has already led me to believe that this is a pretty sure thing and that we are going to set up a plan for treatment. She then calls me up and says that the MRI came back and there are no lesions- so you have a lesser chance of this progressing to MS and we are going to diagnose this as ""clinically isolated syndrome"". See you in 6 months for another MRI. So, naturally, i'm confused. How do you go from saying you're 99% sure we're going to treat this to see you in 6 months? In the next several months, I continue to communicate with this NP through their online portal and explain to her that i'm still feeling pretty bad such as fatigue, body weakness, body twitches and overall brain fog. She dismisses me time and time again. In June, 2018 I reach out again and insinst on getting another MRI. She agrees and also says she wants me to get more blood work done so I receive the authorization from my insruance but still hear nothing about scheduling the MRI. I follow up again and she said that the blood work ""isn't commercially available"" I said I don't know what that means and let another couple of weeks go by. Then, my eye starts to irritate me again and I reach out AGAIN following up on MRI/bloodwork and her response is ""go see your opthamologist."" This is when I said to myself- Enough is enough! Time for a second opinion. So, after a facebook referral post - I was referred to a Neuro in my area. I reached out and had an appointment the following week. I met with the PA and explained my entire history as well as how I was feeling currently. He agreed that an MRI would be most beneficial. So, within 3 days I had the MRI. Results are in and my appointment is the following week. Well, what do you know, NEW LESIONS are present on my brain. I called and spoke to the PA and he conferenced in the Neuro who reassured me that everything was going to be okay and that we would go over everything in our upcoming appointment and rescheduled me so that I could meet with him and his assistant to make me feel more at ease. Fast forward to present day and we are now moving in right direction towards Medication and physcial therapy and monitoring me every 6 weeks and actual SUPPORT from the doctor. Trust yourself and your body and don't settle when people dismiss you or make you feel invalidated. This may have resulted in an unfortunate diagnoses, but now I can try to get back in charge of my life."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531846600323894/Telling-Your-Kids-You-Have-Multiple-Sclerosis	"by Lorna J. Moorhead. Recently a mother asked me how I told my young son about my Multiple Sclerosis. "" How do you explain that some days you are always in bed or sick?"" She was very frustrated and upset. After being sick for a week now, her five-year-old son was really getting agitated and stressed. She needed help, but was not getting the answers she wished form her doctors. ""They all tell me that he is on a need to know basis, only tell him what he needs to know. I can't even begin to think of how to explain the complex workings of MS and the brain. I'm not sure he even knows what a brain is!"" when this email came flashing across my screen I sat back and smiled. I am not a doctor or a psychologist. I do not profess to know what will happen to my son's psyche because of the way I explained my disease to him. If someday I am called to rescue my son from a local hospital where they have him strapped up in a room yelling, ""KILL ALL WHITE CELLS!"" then I will admit defeat and shut my mouth. Until that happens, I will continue to give advice to mothers who after finding my website for moms with MS (MS Moms), send me frantic emails asking for some sliver of help. I recall how much help I received from my pediatrician when my son was a baby, ""Yep. That's a boy all right!"" And how much help I received from my friends, ""Put down the Brazelton and step away from the Dr. Spock! Good, now go to the neighborhood park, sit back and learn."" (Swimming pools, parks, grocery stores, these are the places to learn child rearing.). Therefore, after telling her to check up on my version of how I told my son on the web site, my next suggestion was as follows:. Ways to explain MS to your younger children:. The Brain:. First, draw Mr. Stick Figure. Make a big circle for the head. Draw a kidney bean or a peanut inside the head. That's the Mr. Stick's brain. Circle the brain showing that it is inside the head. Next, draw lines from the brain to different parts of the body, i.e., the hands, feet, legs. Now try to explain that the brain in Mr. Stick's head sends messages (orders) through those lines in the body. (At this point, my drawing looked like poor Mr. Stick had a run in with a jellyfish.). How do the nerves work? For explaining how the nerves transmit those messages, I used the idea of the phone. He didn't get it. Next, we moved on to his remote control car. I had him hold the controller and told him it was the brain. Then we attached some strings from his remote to the car itself to act as nerves. When my son moved the joystick one way or another, we talked about those messages (orders) went down the string to the car to tell it what to do. The strings were the nerves and the remote the brain. When the message doesn't go through. Next, we began to fray and cut some of the strings attached to the car. (While my son was in the bathroom, I took out one of the batteries to better explain my idea.) When he came back, he tried to get the ""brain"" to tell the body what to do. The car did not move. I explained that this is what happens when those nerves from the brain to the body get damaged. Another way to explain how the messages do not get through, is to take a long wrapping paper tube and talk through it to your son, then if you begin to cut the tube or break it, The sound changes and the message is not as clear. If he is interested in walkie-talkies, try changing the frequencies and noticing on which channel the message gets through the best, then switching channels and showing how the sound breaks up. (You can do this with TV channels as well.). Finally, when those messages don't get through, it causes your body to do funny things and makes you sick. Though it is a bit farfetched, you can tell your child that the ""be happy"" message is not getting through today. The same with the ""be awake"" message. How do the nerves get damaged? A basic way to explain what happens to the nerves and the myelin and to explain what each are, is by getting out an Oreo cookie. The myelin is the cookie outside and the nerves are the mushy white inside. If you chip at the cookie cover, the white (nerve) becomes exposed. Take the top off and drop the cookie on the ground, dirt gets all over the white filling and that shows how the nerve is not protected. Talk about how a dirty nerve might be bad at sending correct messages. Another way to do this is with a hotdog and hotdog bun. You can poke at the hotdog bun with a fork, and the hotdog is still okay, but if you remove the bun and the hotdog gets hurt. These ideas explain how the myelin protects the nerves. What is attacking the Myelin? Think of a TV show or movie that he loves, one that has definite bad guys and good guys (Try Ash, Misty and Broc against Team Rocket and Meowth from Pokemon). Try to explain MS by pitting the good guys (your medicine) against the bad guys (the raging white cells.) The bad guys want to destroy the nerve coatings and the good guys must stop them. Since explaining the white cells as misguided might prove too confusing for a younger child, just be blunt and make them bad guys. It's a simple concept that children can grasp and process quickly. In my case I never had to explain cells to my son at all, I just told him there was a battle going on in my body and he accepted it. (I wish adults were this easy to that easy to get along with.). If you do not take medicine for your MS, just explain that there are good guys and bad guys. Always assure your child that the bad guys are not winning. Remind your child that like in most of their favorite movies, bad guys never win. (Unless they're running for office.). If you do take some form of medicine for your MS, explain that the medicine is the good guys. When my son accidentally burst in while I was giving myself my nightly shot, I just calmly told him ""This is the way I shoot the good guys into my body so they can go attack the bad guys."" Being a typical boy, now he wants to watch every night as I take my shot so he can cheer on the good guys! (Mommy is having a hard time deciding whether it is appropriate for him or not. Then again what could be more frightening then the Teletubbies?). (Now for young children the bad guys don't have to be killed or attacked, just put in time outs, for eternity.). Remember the Basics:. 1. There is a battle going on in your body. (On the other hand, some cells are just being brats are not doing what they have been told to do.). 2. Nerves tell your body what to do and are protected by coats. (When he goes out during winter with a jacket on, he is protected from the cold the same way the myelin protects the nerves from damage.). 3. When the coat is damaged or removed, the nerve is exposed and the messages don't get through correctly. (When he takes off his jacket in cold winter weather, he can get too cold, or even sick, just as the nerves get hurt or irreparably damaged.). 4. You are not going to die. Your son may need to hear this a bunch! 5. The medicine you take (or if you don't take any explain you have good cells that are battling the confused cells), controls the bad guys what to do. Alternatively, it gets rid of the bad guys who are trying to take off the nerve coats. 6. There will be days when the bad guys seem to be winning. On those days Mommy or Daddy will not be feeling good. The best thing for your child to do is help you rest.

Looking back, I really wonder when MS started in me. 2012 was the first time I believe I was affected by MS because I was closer to the affected age group. I went into work with double vision and ended up going to the E.R. because I thought something was seriously wrong, but they sent me home to sleep it off which took my stress away. In 2013 I had definite symptoms, although at the time I did not know it was MS. My step changed, I lost the ability to step smoothly, my feet just slapped to the floor, but I thought it was as a result of walking 19 miles a night for work. At the end of 2015, after a year and a half of driving a semi nationally and having numerous symptoms, I was struck with double vision which forced me to go to the doctor where they discovered lesions in my brain and I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis."																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693250086504335362/Activity-Feed-:-MS-Connection	"My first instance with MS was just as I was starting 8th grade. Getting out of bed on the first day of school I noticed a little gray dot in my field of vision. Thinking maybe I had gotten something stuck in my eye. I went to ask my parents If there was indeed something in my eye. They didn't find anything so I went to school thinking maybe they were right . The next day when i got out of bed the little gray spot had doubled in size. I was frightened I told my parents that it had doubled. My mom called the optometrist. She said she wanted to see me ASAP. As all this happened the spot was doubling every day. I was entirely blind in my left eye by the next Monday. The optometrist sent me to The Moran Eye Center for an examination. They found that I had lost vision because of Optic Neuritis. The doctors there put me on a treatment for that. After about a month I lost equilibrium. At the same time I lost the ability to hear on my right side very suddenly. I was admitted to PCMC for more testing. By this time I had been tested for Lyme Disease, Lupus,and Mononucleosis as well as many others. After a Lumbar Puncture they found the culprit Multiple Sclerosis. Being only 14 it didn't make sense. I didn't really let it even start to sink in until my discharge when they told me I couldn't leave until I gave myself the first Avonex dose. It took me 30 minutes to give myself that first shot. It has been 15 years since then I have done a great many things never letting my MS get in the way."

It came on suddenly around 6pm. It was to late to do anything so i just left it alone figuring maybe i got clourine it it or something since I had been swimming that day. I woke up the next morning and my eye was blurry. It felt like I had a smudge on my glasses or a scratch on my eye. It was saturday so i sort of shrugged it off. By monday I figured i should het it checked out because it wasnt getting better. I went to the optometrist and they couldnt help me. Then I went to an optimologist who then thought maybe it was optic neuritis. They sent me to a specialty outpatient eye hospital in miami to get steroids. Got the steroids and on my way home I went. The next day my neurologist wanted to admit me to the hospital to do some tests. She had suspected ms but nothing proved it. When i got to the hospital i was admitted for a spinal tap. During the spinal tap I hear the nurse saying I was going to the icu. At this point im panicking thinking they paralized me with the needle in my back. Apparently my lactic acid levels were stupid high from all the steroids they gave me the day before at the eye hospital. After 4 days in icu, a negative spinal tap, nothing pointing to a positive diagnosis of ms. I go home. My vision eventually comes back and i move on with my life. Fast forward until September. Same eye. I wake up and im literally blind. Its not blurry this time. Im blind. I go to the hospital. More tests, another mri, this one shows lesions. I get a positive diagnosis of MS. Im given steroids and here i am today.

Fatigue that I could not explain away to people that thought I was just lazy, forgetting things. I was always a little bit... But I thought that I was relatively normal, until around twenty years old. When I was twenty, my symptoms progressed quickly. I fell a lot, blacked out a lot, amd had gaps in my memory. I am told that I fell down a flight of stairs at church one day, herniating a disk in my back, but I have no memory of this. I desperately looked for a diagnosis, a reason why I couldn't do things, but with no answers. Until I finally found a neurologist, who ordered an MRI. Who, after seeing the images, said that there were so many lesions that I should have been unnable to get out of bed, and told my mom that she needed to take me to a hospital, where they could run more tests, and where I was finally diagnosed with MS.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531988174089272/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	"I started frequently experiencing terrible migraines in late 2012. I dealt with them for a few months and finally went to my primary care doctor. After a few visits with her I asked if I could see a neurologist. She gave me a referral and then I had to play the waiting game before I could get an appointment. My neurologist did some tests and didn't seem too concerned, but asked if I wanted to have an MRI to rule out tumors. Finally had an MRI and the results came back with several lesions on my brain. I was shocked. My neurologist asked me if I had ever had trauma to the head or any bad infections in my life. I said no and he decided to have me get a lumbar puncture. When I had my lumbar puncture, it was very uncomfortable. Laying there on my stomach while I knew a huge needle was going into my back was very scary. I did not like that experience! The next day I felt pretty good. Did some walking around and later that evening started feeling sick and had a bad headache. Could not be out of bed very long. Went to sleep and the next morning was horrible. Had to go to the ER. Had a spinal headache and had to have a blood patch done. Felt a little better and they decided to let me go. As I sat up and was getting dressed and shoes on, I threw up. I knew something wasn't right and told them but they let me go. The rest of the night at home was terrible, I was getting sick and could not get out of bed. The next morning I went right back to the ER again and was given a second blood patch. This time it worked great and I was so much better. That was a scary time. The results took forever to make their way to my doctor. After a long wait my neurologist called me and told me that the lab that was testing my spinal fluid did not test the third vial of fluid by the day they were supposed to and that the fluid had gone bad. They were supposed to test three vials of fluid but only did two. My neurologist and his staff were not happy at all. So this made me very frustrated and scared, because I was told that normally if two of the tests came back abnormal, there's a good chance it's MS. With the results we did have, which included the presence of Oligoclonal bands in my spinal fluid, my neurologist referred me to an MS specialist. When I first saw the MS doctor, he was not concerned that the third spinal fluid test wasn't done. He decided to have me go and have my blood drawn for about 9 or so things to rule them out. One of those was lyme disease. That was the main thing my doctor thought it could be other than MS. Since that came back negative, as well as everything else (except a slight vitamin D deficiency), he has diagnosed me with MS. He wanted to start me on a medication but I don't seem to react well to new medications so I am scared. He told me we can wait until March 2014 and I can do another MRI to see if there are new lesions. Then discuss medications to start then. The main thing that is hard for me are the migraines. I usually get them several times a week, but sometimes go 2 or even 3 weeks occasionally without having one. I have two young children and want another. I never thought I'd have to question whether or not I really should have another child (or do many other things I want to) because of MS. But even though I am still newly diagnosed and still need to learn more about MS, I am trying to not let it scare me away from things I would do if I was not diagnosed."

Possibly the earliest known descriptions of a case of Multiple Sclerosis referred to the woman depicted in this woodcut, St. Lidwina of Schiedam. Lidwina lived in 14th century Holland and historical texts reveal that she was afflicted with a debilitating disease, sharing many characteristics with MS. St Lidwina’s disease began soon after a fall while skating, at the age of 16. From that time onwards, she developed walking difficulties, headaches and violent pains in her teeth. By the age of 19, both her legs were paralysed and her vision was disturbed. Over the next 34 years, Lidwina's condition slowly deteriorated, although with apparent periods of remission, until eventually she died at the age of 53. St Lidwina's symptoms were consistent with those of MS, as were the age of onset, duration and course of disease. Together these factors suggest that a posthumous diagnosis of MS may be plausible, therefore dating MS back to the 14th century. ==> Sir Augustus d'Esté (1794-1848)."

By the middle of this century, a great deal was known about the pathological changes that occur in MS, and the clinical effects of those changes, but the underlying mechanisms leading to tissue pathology were poorly understood, although an immunological role had been confirmed. During the 1970s and 1980s, John. Prineas of New Jersey, USA used specialised light and electron microscopy techniques to examine the detailed histology of MS lesions, providing clues about their pathogenesis ( 16 ). The slide shows one of Prineas's electron microscopy images showing a microglial cell (arrow) and macrophage in the vicinity of demyelinating axons ( 16 ). It had already been shown that MS lesions contain lymphocytes and plasma cells, suggesting the existence of a local immune response to an unknown antigen, but Prineas's observations led him to conclude that both macrophages and microglial cells are required for the digestion of myelin. Prineas's studies also suggest that within chronic lesions there is a continued expression and processing of antigen in the absence of fresh lesion formation ( 16 ). ==> Ian R Young (1932-present)."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531963498624748/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	"In 2007, I was an unsuspecting thirteen-year-old girl moving from homeschool to public high school. Little did I know my life was going to be more complicated than I ever imagined. During my years in high school, I was a varsity swimmer on a small team. I loved every minute of it. But I failed to realize the toll MS was taking on my life. After a two-hour practice, I would arrive home and attempt to do homework - to no avail. I would fall asleep writing, eating, and even talking. My parents would come over to me and wake me up so I could finish my assignments. This was a common occurrence throughout my four years at McNair Academic High School. Weekends during swimming seasons were spent in hibernation. Friday nights I would sleep up to 14 hours straight, trying to recover from the irreconcilable fatigue. I still had no inclination of my impending diagnosis. During high school, I was diagnosed with mono at least twice; so severely that I could not swim. My spleen was so swollen diving posed a threat to its integrity. Even still, there was no hint of MS. Outside of this, high school was a parade of sick days, with yearly installments of bronchitis, sinusitis, cases of stomach flu, and mono. I was just one of those kids that was always sick. 2011 brought graduation and college. I got a job as an assistant physical therapist, which I kept for about 2 years and few odd months. During that time, I was able to learn much about muscles, neurology, and how to rehab based on what the ailment was. As those two years passed, red flags came and went, with no diagnosis. My left hip had ghost pain for a few weeks, I needed glasses and suddenly didn't need them anymore. In 2012, I got into a car accident. Both parties walked away with no severe injuries. The day of the accident, I continued to work after filing a police report. The accident was only a financial burden until that afternoon. At work, I was picking up exercise equipment from the floor when I lost my balance and fell. I noticed that when I grabbing for things, my depth perception was altered. My boss at the time told me of the Epley maneuver, which he offered to do when the office closed. I agreed as I believed it would solve all of my symptoms from the accident. 8 pm rolled around, and my boss performed the Epley maneuver while I was on a treatment table. I sat up and began violently throwing up and shaking. I was freezing but my body was soaked in sweat. My boss said adverse reactions weren't that common. I could not function enough to walk, let alone drive, so my parents came and picked me and my car up. The ride home was torturous, and I barely made it up the porch stairs before vomiting again. The night continued on and I faced irreconcilable vertigo and nausea. I woke up screaming ""I'm falling!"" with clenched fists and hammering lungs. Vertigo would come and go in waves until I resorted to sleeping sitting up. In the two weeks that followed, I would have severe ""falling attacks"" where I was hit with overwhelming vertigo that rendered me unable to move. I finally made an appointment with my family doctor. An MRI was scheduled, and the doctor prescribed numerous vertigo medications, including Antivert, Ativan, Lorazepam, and others. After about two months, my symptoms faded, and I never thought much of it. I never got results from the MRI but as a college student, I didn't care as long as I was feeling okay. The new year came and left, and I was ready to finish out my second year of college. Late in March 2013, I had severe numbness in my right arm. My ""highfives"" would hit my friends' faces, my arm would casually hit people next to me as I walked by them, and my ability to grip a pencil disappeared. Working for a PT & chiro, I firmly believed it was a pinched nerve. I went to an orthopedic who pricked me with pinchy and prickly tools, and tickled the right side of my body including my face, neck, back, arm, and leg. I found it funny and awkward at the same time. When he sent me for a preliminary MRI I thought no big deal of it. When the results came back, he sent me for 4 more MRIs and I knew something wasn't right. Frantic diagnoses were being made, and test after test was run. Bloodwork, Western blot test, spinal tap, EP, and so on. My spinal test was a bizarre experience. During this process, my MRI from 2012 surfaced. It turned out my family doctor had called my mother with the results, and noted that the presence of MS was possible, but since I was not presenting symptoms, they chose not to pursue the diagnosis. In hindsight, the vertigo was clearly related to MS, triggered by the car accident. That MRI did not change the present situation. The spinal tap was horrific. The treating doctor did the procedure bedside, and unguided, while I screamed in agony. He was unable to reach the spinal column the first try, and his second and third attempts were as unsuccessful. When his fourth attempt made minimal contact, he extracted barely enough spinal fluid for the test, and blamed it on scoliosis which I do not have. He left the hospital room saying rest for several hours and drink a can of Coke - the caffeine would help alleviate any symptoms from the spinal tap. The truth of the matter is that his bedside ""experiment"" left me with a puncture in my spinal column, preventing my body from pressurizing the spinal column, leaving me with severe nausea and vomiting, dizziness, headaches, and inability to leave the bed. During the week, I was rushed to the ER for severe pain and vomiting. I was released the next day. After these symptoms continued for a week, the treating doctor who performed the spinal tap agreed to see me again. It was quickly discovered that I need a blood patch to clot the puncture in my spinal column. The blood patch cured my issues, and I left that doctor's office and never returned. The next three years have been filled with emotional rollercoasters, but I am always a step further on my journey, a little closer to living the fullest life possible. I started out using Copaxone but retired when I discovered the effects on fertility. I became vegan for a year, as much evidence supports a plant-based diet is an effective treatment of MS. Now I live day to day, thankful each morning that I'm not paralyzed. I recently started working out and have chosen to live a natural life and take the episodes as they come. Much Love."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715562377112502979/Signs-on-early-onset-Parkinsons?	"Hello, I hope this message finds you and that you are doing well as i realize this post was several years old! I came across your story on these forums and could not believe how close ours match, down to the month it started and age. I was hoping you would be kind enough to share if you have found anything out by now? I would appreciate any tips for recovery. Here is a quick background on my story. I am a 31 year old male, who recently had my first born son in June of this year. One night in mid October, my middle finger on my right hand started twitching out of nowhere for several hours. I began to feel light headed as well and googled the symptoms (huge mistake). I came across ALS, Parkinson's and MS. I watched my grandpa die of Parkinson's and my 15 year old cousin was just diagnosed with MS. The amount of anxiety and stress that came over me was like nothing i have ever experienced before as all i could think about is the burden i would be on my wife and newborn son and how i might not live to see him grow up. A week later my forearm became extremely tight as if i had worked it out. My fingers became physically hard to move. Over the following week it worked it's way up to my bicep, tricep, elbow, and shoulder. I had these burning pains in all these muscle groups purely on my right side, but they never all hurt at the same time. It continued to jump around and eventually spread into my back, armpit, and across my chest. My anxiety was so bad the PCP had to put me on xanax as i for sure thought i was done. It got so bad one night I had to go to the ER, they did a CT scan and it all came back normal. Over the following weeks my legs became extremely tight, and I have noticed my right hand seems to be colder than the left. The middle finger finally stopped after 3 weeks, but i now have twitching all over my body. Shoulder blades, biceps, legs, no place is safe. My left arm has started to tighten up a bit as well, but not to the extent of my right arm which still remains in a lot of pain at my elbow and shoulder. My middle finger still feels very tingly. I have had to stop going to the gym and running completely. Since then, i have had an MRI of my brain, cervical spine, and lungs (looking for a tumor), 18 blood test with nothing showing, a spectrum of heart test that all came back ok, and 2 EMG's, 2 NCV's by separate neurologist because I can't shake the thought of als. The only abnormalities I have are 4 bulging disc in my neck, which my neurologist says wouldn't cause this, and one NCV showing mild carpal tunnel in both arms and mild cubital tunnel in the right arm. The neurologist and orthopedic doctor both said they aren't causing this either. My neurologist's excuse is that i am 31 and too young for these diseases, which only makes it worse being told that as i know i physically feel something wrong. I started physical therapy 4 weeks ago, but am barely seeing any improvement. A steroid pack didn't do anything either. I would be unbelievably grateful if you could let me know if you ended up finding anything. Part of me believes mine could be entirely stress and anxiety as I have been in a constant state of worry since October with the fears ALS and Parkinson's. That along with being constantly light headed has rendered me unable to drive for the past 3 months and put a horrible strain on my marriage not being able to help with my son. My next appointments aren't till March and I feel that I will mentally break by then. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you for your time,."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4714502381913201298/It's-not-the-amount-of-lesions...	"Wow!! This thread occurred during the month I took off and I missed it completely! This is a very, VERY important topic. It is the topic that will be taking center stage as soon as the techniques for quantifying brain volume become available to the general practitioner. Yes, absolutely axonal degeneration is probably more responsible for our accumulating disability than our T2 inflammatory demyelinating lesions are. 99% of discussion about MS is centered around the visible lesions on the MRI, and around our symptoms and relapses. The appearance of enhancing lesions on the T2 images do correlate with appearance of new symptoms. That is the inflammatory part of MS. And most of the therapies are aimed at reducing this inflammatory process. Our doctors gage disease activity by how many new lesions we get and how many disappear. Some neurologists actually presume to tell us that the MRI picture is 1000% of the truth about our disease. No lesions=no MS. No new lesions=no progression of disease or no disease activity. Some even deny that our symptoms=disease activity if the MRI doesn't show it. We need to RUN from these doctors. It does appear that the inflammatory demyelinating plaque is most directly related to our relapses and remissions. But, we have always talked about the progressive disability we begin to accrue at some point in our disease. For some this accrual is early. These are the people that complain that some of their symptoms have appeared and steadily worsened since the beginning. This is true for me. For others, they may have little direct axonal loss early in the disease and most of their relapses seem to heal almost completely. Only after many years do they begin to collect disability. Nothing could be farther from the truth. While there is a lot of research going on with the inflammatory demyelination process, the real bulk of scientific research is focused on the topic above. We KNOW that even before any lesions form, there is some sort of direct attack on the nerve fibers themselves, causing them to die and ""drop out."" This is called ""direct axonal degeneration."" They do not demyelinate first. This is happening in the part of the white matter that looks ""normal"" on the MRIs. What causes this or triggers this is not known, but they are searching for the answers. Along with this, it is also known that severe, inflammatory demyelinating lesions can also result in death of the neuron and axonal death. But, this is not the cause of most of the loss of central nervous system tissue which results in the appearance called atrophy. People with MS have an ongoing brain and spinal cord ""atrophy"" (shrinkage) that is much faster than that which occurs normally as we age. The majority of this is from direct axonal degeneration and death and NOT from inflammatory demyelination. Yet all we hear about is inflammatory T2 lesions. Researchers are developing elegant ways of measuring brain atrophy on the MRIs. It is done by counting the digital pixels of the amount of CSF in the images. When brain tissue drops out, the new space must be filled with CSF. So as the CSF spaces enlarge, they take up more pixels on the MRI and can be calculated. But, these calculations do not seem to be available to our doctors. I can only think that if our doctors (the ones who are willing to think) had this available, they could look at someone who has classic MS relapses and makes the first Criterion of the McDonald Critieria. (That is, two clinical attacks and two separate clinical lesions) If the MRI showed no inflammatory lesions, then they could look for atrophy. In the presence of atrophy, that could be a new ""Positive MRI finding"" and the diagnosis could be made without waiting for lesions to show up. T-Lynn (where is she !!) would have been diagnosed earlier. I think many people, especially those with Primary Progressive Disease, would be able to be diagnosed earlier. PPMS is characterized by much more destruction by direct axonal degeneration than by inflammatory lesions, though some have large amounts of both. Many times people with PPMS have many smaller brain lesions and show early spinal cord atrophy. Because they often do not have the strong inflammatory T2 lesions, they are more likely to have negative LP results. In fact only 60% to 70% of PPMS patients have oligoclonal banding. But, they have early and marked brain and spinal cord atrophy. Some of the latest studies I have read have discussed that spinal cord atrophy is the most accurate predictor of real disability. I'm watching all of this with great interest. Well, this was just a jumble of the thoughts I have been wanting to write on this topic and to make into a Health Page. The lesson to take away from this is that there is a whole HUGE amount of disease occurring in our brains that our neurologists can't see as T2 lesions. And only after a huge amount of the axons have died and dropped out will they be able to see the atrophy. Does this explain some of those people with classic MS symptoms (in whom the mimics have been ruled out) who have ""normal"" MRIs? I think it does. I like the quote that ess found: ""The results suggest that the damage to normal-appearing brain tissue plays a larger role in the progression of atrophy and clinical disability than do the visible lesions,"" Dr. Vrenken said. We know it's happening. We just have to find our way to neurologists who think and see this process and forget counting MRI lesions. Comments? I recommend that everyone read this entire thread. These are important concepts and they will be new to many people. I applaud Heather's neuro for being so enlightened.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4714491891358336505/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	"When it came to illness or injury, I grew up in a very mind over matter kind of household. I was taught to suck it up, push through, and not complain. Basically, if you don't think you're sick, then you aren't. I carried this into my adult life. When I started experiencing the beginning symptoms of MSin 2003, I did what I always did: I ignored them. Ok, so I'm clumsy and started forgetting things, who cares right? I mentioned them to my doctor in passing; I mainly just saw her to get allergy and GERD medication. To my surprise she took interest in these seemingly small issues. Whenever I would see her every 6 months for my refill appointments she would ask about my symptoms, any differences, did they get better or worse, anything new and unusual? Still, I wasn't concerned. In 2006, my memory and cognitive problems started getting worse, it started to concern me because I worked in emergency services. A mistake I made could literally be life or death for someone. Stress and worry only started a vicious cycle and made my memory issues worse. By late 2008, I was at a point where I would go to work, then come home and cry everyday to release all the anxiety I had to hold in while on the job. It was too much. After months of misery and discussions with my husband, we decided that I should leave the career I had loved. I resigned in April 2009. After taking a few months off to be a stay at home mom, I decided to join the workforce again and was hired in a clerical position in October 2009. Fighting my failing brain power, clumsiness, and dizziness, I worked happily in my non-stressful and simple (compared to my previous work) job. It was fun and gave me something to do and make a little money. July 2010 I was delivered a one-two punch. First, I was rushed to the ER barely conscious with a high fever and ended up being hospitalized. Apparently mind over matter doesn't work on pneumonia. Weeks later, I had to have my gallbladder removed. Nothing seemed the same after that. I had vertigo and balance issues. My normally upbeat, energetic self was exhausted all the time. I couldn't seem to focus or get my mind together. My doctor finally mentioned MS for the first time. I didn't even know what it was, ""The disease Jerry Lewis does the telethon for?"" No, that's muscular dystrophy. She did some in office tests, made some referrals, nothing conclusive. November 2010 I passed out at work, and ended up not being able to return or work another job again. Still no official diagnosis or answers as to what was going on. To make matters worse, my doctor had received a once in a lifetime employment offer in another country and left. I had to find a new doctor. I am particular about who I let handle my health so I went through several, had to explain everything repeatedly, get puzzled looks. I started to think maybe I had become some crazy hypochondriac along the way. I was FINALLY diagnosed in March 2012. By then I had progressed to the point that I was sensitive to motion and could no longer drive. I started experiencing what I refer to as dead leg, and could not walk unassisted. I was first put on interferons and steroids, but I still progressed. I am now on Gilenya. I cannot sit upright too long without my back spasming. I cannot comprehend most conversation without being face to face so my mind can not only process the words, but body language and mannerisms as well. My limbs constantly have an achy, restless feeling to them. I will instantly forget where I am, what I'm doing, and sometimes even what month or time of year it is. I can't help but wonder, if I had never ignored my symptoms or took them more seriously, would I be where I am today? Could I have prevented becoming disabled? Could I still have a career and hobbies? If there is one thing I could share with the world, I would say: Don't ignore your body. You know best what is right and wrong. Don't be afraid or ashamed to tell your doctor. If you don't feel your doctor is helping, don't be afraid to get a new doctor. Don't stop until you have answers and a treatment plan that is working. You have so much you can lose if you don't love and take care of yourself. I am still fighting. It is a lot harder for me where I am at now, but I know it could get so much worse if I give up. Never give up on yourself."	"234,244"	2	"speaker,patient"	"1412,1415"	1	"speaker,patient"

You are going through a difficult time right now so it is important to know that you are entitled to have a melt down before picking yourself back up and going forward. You are already taking great steps by reaching out and I know that you will find support and answers here that will help you when you need it most. I have received great support here so I speak from experience. My children were 2 & 5 when I first got sick and I thought I wouldn't be around to help them grow up. They are now 20 & 23 so have faith. As others have said, it could be worse (your dx). It does s*ck but you can now become involved and informed and be stronger for the battle. You will have great times in the future, not every day will feel scary. My biggest recommendation is that you get a neurologist that you like and respect. If you already have that fantastic! If not, once you have a chance to calm down and settle in it would be good to find one that you feel comfortable and confident with. It will make your treatment 10x better. Keep us posted on your progress & don't hesitate to reach out for help. Erin :)."

Years later, I had another episode of optic neuritis in my early 20s. I was referred to a neuro-opthamologist who suggested I may have MS. I underwent further investigations and was referred to an MS clinic and was followed by a neurologist for many years. In my mid 20s, I had a relapse where I had reduced sensation in my lower half of my body. My motor function was unaffected. A spine MRI confirmed lesions in my spinal cord, the brain MRI confirmed activity in the lesions. Mind you, there were changes in my brain MRI every year. I was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and was started on immunomodulator with anti-inflammatory properties, Aubagio. I suffered hair loss three months after I started on the medication. I am now married, and plan to start a family. I stopped taking aubagio and am currently on copaxone injections."

A new study has shown that drinking hot chocolate daily could help to reduce fatigue and tiredness among people suffering from MS (multiple sclerosis). The results of this new study were published in the latest issue of the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry . The team of researchers from Oxford Brookes University and the Univesity of Palermo, explain that cocoa contains flavonoids and these flavonoids are compounds that are well known antioxidants. These flavonoids reportedly help relieve tiredness and pain. Flavonoids are present in raw cacao and several other plant based foods. These also help in reducing inflammation. Image Credit: Shutterstock. MS is a severely debilitating and progressive disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. It leads to symptoms of vision problems, movement problems and alteration of sensation and balance. This new study was supported by the MS Society and in this 40 people with MS were included. The study was of six week duration. These patients all had the relapsing remitting form of the disease. They were divided into two groups. The first group was given a cup of cocoa which is rich in flavonoids while the other group received a different version of the drink with less amount of flavonoids. Results showed that those patients who were given the cocoa drink with higher amount of flavonoids felt less fatigued compared to the other group. Mood, cognitive performance as well as certain physical movements were improved with the flavonoid rich drink. There was a 45 percent improvement in the alertness of the participants and a 80 percent improvement in speed of walking the team reported. While the former was reported by the patients themselves, the latter was individually measured. Dr Shelly Coe, senior lecturer in nutrition at Oxford Brookes University in her statement said that the next step would to “to know exactly how effective flavonoid-rich hot chocolate is and whether it can benefit all people with MS before it's recommended.” Dr Susan Kohlhaas, director of research at the MS Society added, “We know fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of MS and it can have a huge impact on quality of life, so finding more comprehensive treatments that help is one of our top research priorities.”. Doctor Paolo Ragonese, of the University of Palermo in Italy summed up, “Our study establishes that the use of dietary interventions is feasible and may offer possible long-term benefits to support fatigue management, by improving fatigue and walking endurance. The use of dietary approaches to reduce fatigue and associated factors in people with MS may be an easy, safe, and cost-effective way to have an impact on quality of life and independence, allowing people to feel more in control of their condition. A full evaluation, including wider geography, longer follow up and cost effectiveness is now indicated.”."

A new study has shown that drinking a cup of flavonoid-enriched cocoa each day could help to reduce fatigue in people suffering from multiple sclerosis. Kirill Z |. Daily consumption of the drink could be a convenient and safe way to alleviate the tiredness that affects 90% of people with multiple sclerosis, say the researchers. Multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative condition that affects more than 100,000 people in the UK alone and fatigue is one of the most challenging symptoms of the condition. Flavonoids , which are the antioxidants also found in fruit, vegetables and red wine, have previously been shown to have anti-inflammatory and free radical scavenging properties. Research has also linked flavonoid intake to health benefits such as improved heart and gut health and increased longevity. Furthermore, studies involving chronic fatigue sufferers have suggested that eating dark chocolate may boost energy levels. For the current study, Paolo Ragonese (University of Palermo in Italy) and team recruited 40 patients recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and gave them a cup of flavonoid-rich cocoa or a low-flavonoid version to drink every day for six weeks. As reported in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry , those who drank the high-flavonoid drink reported a 45% improvement in alertness levels and an 80% boost in walking speed, compared with the participants who were given the low-flavonoid drink. The researchers also found that those drinking the flavonoid-rich drink reported a reduction in pain symptoms. Ragonese says the study demonstrates that dietary interventions may offer possible long-term benefits to support fatigue management, by improving fatigue and walking endurance:.

Just a quick question, has anyone out there been on both Tysabri and Ocrevus? Which one worked better for you? I'm hesitant to try Tysabri due to the risk of PML, but it seems to have fewer side effects and has been out for a while now. On the flip side, Ocrevus seems to have more side effects but less serious ones and hasn't really been out long enough to see long term effects.

I went to my primary doctor a couple of years ago because I was having issues with my balance (if I lose my balance I have no chance of correcting myself so I fall), intermittent double vision, dizziness, horrible muscle cramps (where it feels like my bones are breaking) and memory/word finding issues. She did a bunch of tests and found that my B12 level was at a critical low so I was put on replacement. My B12 levels are now much higher so well within therapeutic levels. She had me see a neurologist who ordered a bunch more tests including MRI, auditory/vertigo and neuropsych testing. He also found that I have neuropathy in my hands and feet. I have tremors in my left hand from time to time where it's tough to hold onto anything because it's shaking so bad. Fast forward to a month or so ago I was at work and the left side of my face, hand/arm and trunk went numb and tingly so much so that I thought for sure I had a left sided facial droop but nope. I couldn't feel what was in my left hand but yet I was. I went to the ER after this happened intermittently for a couple of weeks, each episode lasting anywhere from a few moments to an hour and a half. CT and MRI were clean, no lesions again. I had a follow-up with the neurologist and she tried to say it was ""brain irritation"" and wanted to give me a medication to treat my migraines (I don't have migraines anymore, no aura, no visual change, no headache, nothing). I contacted the patient advocate and got someone to finally listen to me because after reviewing my records they were incomplete and/or incorrect. She asked if I'd been to the MS clinic yet, I told her no because they keep saying that it's not MS. Just had SSEP and VEP testing this past Thursday with follow up on the 11th. The technician told me that they were getting ""informative results"" during the leg portions of the SSEP testing, it was giving me full body jerks which started on the side the stimulator was on and the whole time I was hearing her click click click during it. I feel like I'm going nuts waiting on the next appointment and hopefully this time the doctor will actually listen to me and not write me off like I'm losing my mind. Has anyone else had similar reaction to the SSEP testing? Mar 04, 2019 9:37 AM. Hello grebelmn,. I hope that your doctors are closer to finding out what is causing your symptoms with this additional testing.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4713499287570072203/A-New-Study-Looks-at-Why-the-Immune-System-Attacks-Myelin	"The holy grail of curing multiple sclerosis (MS) seems best described as finding the cause of MS, which will enable scientists to identify the appropriate treatment and even, possibly, the way to prevent it from occurring in the first place. So far, the cause of MS is unknown. To quote from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society’s statement on what causes multiple sclerosis :. “The cause of MS is not known. Scientists believe MS is triggered by a combination of factors. To identify the cause, research is ongoing in areas of immunology (the study of the body’s immune system), epidemiology (the study of disease patterns in large groups of people) and genetics (understanding the genes that may not be functioning correctly in people who develop MS). Scientists are also studying infectious agents that may play a role."" But now, scientists report they may be getting closer to understanding what sets off MS . Molecular Mimicry May Be Behind the Immune System Attack. The new research builds on an earlier study. In a paper published in June 2013 in Science Translational Medicine , researchers from Germany, Switzerland, and the United States described how they desensitized the immune system to myelin to keep it from attacking that fatty neuron sheath. Last month, news broke about the results of further studies by a group of those researchers. The study — reported in a 58-page scientific paper — suggests that there are myelin-like pieces of protein (actually peptides, which are protein building blocks made of amino acids) on or in viruses and bacteria. This has become known as molecular mimicry, and it may be the reason the body’s immune system attacks myelin. Put simply, a virus or bacteria that has invaded the body may have a part of it that is similar to a part of a protein found in myelin. When the immune system attacks to clear the foreign invader from the body, it also attacks the myelin. The immune system is a smart weapon, but it may be being fooled by similarities in uniform between enemy and good guy. Genetic Variances May Make Myelin More or Less Susceptible. At this early juncture, it looks like there are more than one or two bits of myelin that have quite a few protein pieces that are similar to a good number of viruses and bacteria. It’s possible that genetics play a part in this process, as each person’s myelin is slightly different, based on genes. One person’s slight genetic variance may leave their myelin more susceptible to mimicry, thus more susceptible to autoimmune attack leading to MS. If this avenue of “cause” turns out to be correct, it may be possible for researchers to create a tolerance for these peptides though a procedure called immunotolerance therapy. It’s something of a reverse vaccine. Rather than building up immunity to something by weaponizing the immune system against it, immunotolerance therapy is sort of like introducing allergens in small, controlled amounts to reduce allergic reactions. Immunotolerance Therapy for MS? Time Will Tell! There’s a long way to go before we can expect to see immunotolerance therapy in the clinical setting. That researchers got from research point A to point B in this line of thinking in just five years is, however, promising. Who knows, perhaps those being diagnosed with MS today will have their own myelin peptides turned into a kinder, gentler way to modulate the immune system and keep it from attacking. Fingers crossed! Wishing you and your family the best of health. My book, Chef Interrupted , is available on .

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4711719250838794668/Decline-in-Brain-Volume-Driven-by-Gray-Matter-Atrophy-in-MS-Patients-Despite-Tysabri-Treatment	"BY JONATHAN GRINSTEIN. This finding points to new markers for MS disease progression, and the need to monitor the effectiveness of treatment using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The research article, Gray matter atrophy in multiple sclerosis despite clinical and lesion stability during natalizumab treatment ,” was published in the journal PLOS ONE . Brain volume loss is an important marker for assessing atrophy and disability in MS patients. However, the contribution of gray and white matter to whole brain volume loss in MS warrants further examination. Additionally, there is a need to identify markers to assess the effectiveness of known disease-modifying treatments so that MS patients can receive optimal care. Brain atrophy measurements, both global and regional (whole and partial), assess net tissue damage, reflecting the sum of demyelination — damage to the protective coat (called myelin) that surrounds nerve fibers — and injury and loss of brain cells. Global brain atrophy has predictive importance for MS disease progression, while regional brain atrophy is a more sensitive and reliable indicator of disease status. # Tysabri , marketed by # Biogen , is a monoclonal antibody that has potent anti-inflammatory effects, and is able to reduce relapses and disability progression in patients with relapsing-remitting #MS ( RRMS ). :::::::.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4710671149015396478/Love-Conquers-All:-An-MS-Story---Blog---MS-Society-of-Canada	"At some point in their lives, nearly half of Canadians aged 15 and older have provided care to a family member or friend with a long-term health condition, disability, or aging need. Libby and Grant Sanderson have been married for 36 years and are no exception. When Libby was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1990, their world turned upside down. Grant is now Libby’s caregiver and helps her with everyday activities as well as runs a support group at the MS Society of Canada. Today, Libby and Grant are stronger than ever and have agreed to share with us their story and how they have persevered through it all. What was your initial reaction when you found out about your MS diagnosis? Libby: I had been experiencing numbness for a while, so when I first received my diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), I can’t say I was surprised. The worst part had always been not knowing what was wrong with me, so it was a relief when I was finally diagnosed. At least they had a name for this thing going on with me. Photos by Kristen McLean and Christian Henriquez from Northern Alberta Institute of Technology Photography. When I told my friends and family, they were understanding and supportive. I experienced the same thing with my mother when she was diagnosed with lupus. Nobody sat me down to explain what my mom’s medical situation was and I wish they had, so I wanted to handle the situation differently. Grant: When I first found out that my wife was diagnosed with MS, I broke out into tears. I remembered all the horror stories I heard in the past, and it terrified me. Although I was afraid, I knew it was better to know what we were facing. It’s easier knowing what it is so we can deal with it and hope to conquer it. For the first four or five years, Libby didn’t have many symptoms. She would get flare-ups, which would have major impacts on her lifestyle. She couldn’t walk or talk at times. How did your family take the news? G: We have two children. Our son Dana is 31 and our daughter Kerrie is 29. I think our daughter took the diagnosis very hard. Growing up, teenage girls fight with their mothers about the smallest things. This was more amplified with Libby’s MS because she couldn’t do everything on her own. She couldn’t walk or talk at times, and sometimes, I would have to remind her that she can’t do everything by herself. I think Kerrie resented that her mom has MS. This was tough for a young girl, but now her thoughts are changed. I think we are all learning to let go of our expectations. What have been some of the largest obstacles you have faced as a result of your MS? L: MS has cut down on our ability to travel anywhere we want, even in the city. Not everywhere is wheelchair accessible. G: The past eight years have been the most challenging. Libby has experienced a decline in cognition, as well as physical capabilities, which increased her dependence on others. Her short-term memory has significantly faded and her ability to follow cooking recipes has declined. Libby used to have excellent cooking skills, but MS has taken that away. Additionally, some of the people she used to socialize with have stopped communicating with her. Due to a decrease in her cognitive abilities, she does not use a computer or a smart phone, and her lack of access to social media makes socializing more challenging. How did you first come to be involved with the MS Society? L: We initially became involved with the MS Society through participating in support groups. G: The meetings provide a social outing for people impacted by MS. Libby developed friends through this group. We have now been doing the MS Walk for 25 years! I recently began leading one of the local volunteer support groups as a facilitator. I think it is important you get involved with what your family is doing. If it helps support Libby and others, it is an added bonus. I know first-hand what it is like to live with someone living with MS. It can be hard to explain the idiosyncrasies that the illness goes through, so I feel that I can help others experiencing the same thing. These support groups are also continuing to provide a social outing for people impacted by MS. For Libby, this was her group of friends she developed. How has MS affected you as a caregiver? G: MS affects more than just the person living with MS. As a caregiver you also take on a level of responsibility. People often ask, “How is your wife doing?” but rarely ask, “How are you doing?” It can be hard and depressing and people don’t always think about asking the caregiver. If you could tell other supportive spouses one thing, what would you say? G: Learn about MS. If Libby starts doing something or loses ability to do something you realize it is the MS doing it. It’s not her being silly; it is the MS that impacts her. Sometimes Libby will ask the same question repeatedly – you have to find the patience. She’s not doing it to annoy me, but because she doesn’t remember. You have to answer it as though it is the first time and not the thirty-first time. Patience is a big thing! Find someone to lean on and speak with to discuss the challenges you are facing. We hope that Grant and Libby’s story has provided some comfort to others who may be facing similar experiences. The bond between a person with a chronic disease such as MS and the person, who provides care, can be very strong and positive. At the same time, caregiving can also be physically and emotionally demanding and exhausting. If you’re looking for additional information and support, the 1:1 Caregiver Peer Support Program offers support and comfort for caregivers of those living with MS. Contact the 1:1 Peer Support Program at peersupportprogram@mssociety.ca or call and leave a voicemail at 1-800-268-7582 x3149 to request more information."

Can a spinal tap show me where a brain mri didn’t? Feb 14, 2019 2:47 PM. Hello thefoxyroxy,. I am sorry that you have not been able to find answers from your doctor about what is definitively causing your symptoms yet. I included some information from our website about not having a brain lesion on your MRI that I think will be helpful:. You can read more about MRIs by clicking on this link. Below are other links that may be useful regarding the diagnostic criteria for MS and lumbar punctures:. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF).

However, I learned from my neuro. yesterday that MRIs of the spine are typically only done when you are having issues with your gait, balance, and/or bladder and bowel dysfunction. So if you are, I would request a. spine MRI as well. Crazy cuz yes I’m having crazy h. ir balance and leg issues. So frustrating he didn’t order t. e full mri!

Monday June 26 2017 10:45 AM. Cladribine Tablets receives positive CHMP opinion for treatment of relapsing forms of MS. Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued a positive opinion for approval of Cladribine Tablets (proposed tradename MAVENCLADTM) for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in patients with high disease activity. “The positive opinion from the CHMP is an extraordinary development for Merck, affirming our belief in Cladribine Tablets as a potential important treatment option for patients living with multiple sclerosis,” said Belén Garijo, member of the Executive Board of Merck and CEO Healthcare. “We now eagerly await the European Commission decision, and the opportunity to make a difference in the MS treatment paradigm. Our sincerest thanks to the entire MS community for their unwavering support throughout the Cladribine Tablets journey.”. “We strongly believe in the therapeutic value of Cladribine Tablets and the significant impact this investigational therapy may have on the future of MS care,” said Luciano Rossetti, Global Head of R&D for the biopharma business of Merck. “There are still significant unmet needs for patients with MS, particularly those with high disease activity. We look forward to our continued partnership with the EMA, which has been an invaluable scientific advisor in helping us advance the development of Cladribine Tablets.”. The CHMP positive opinion is based on more than 10,000 patient years of data with over 2,700 patients included in the clinical trial program, and more than 10 years of observation in some patients. The clinical development program included data from three Phase III trials, CLARITY, CLARITY EXTENSION and ORACLE MS, the Phase II ONWARD study and long-term follow-up data from the 8-year prospective registry, PREMIERE. The efficacy and safety results of these studies allowed a full characterization of the benefit-to-risk profile of Cladribine Tablets. In patients with high disease activity, post hoc analyses of the two-year Phase III CLARITY trial demonstrated that Cladribine Tablets reduced the annualised relapse rate by 67% and the risk of 6-month confirmed EDSS progression by 82% versus placebo. As demonstrated in the Phase III CLARITY EXTENSION study no further Cladribine treatment was required in Years 3 and 4. The comprehensive dataset has informed the posology and monitoring requirements. The most important side effects are lymphopenia, which can be severe and long-lasting, and infections, including herpes zoster. The CHMP’s recommendation will be referred to the European Commission which is expected to make a final decision on the marketing authorisation application for Cladribine Tablets within 67 days from the CHMP opinion. MAVENCLAD™ is the proprietary name submitted to EMA for the investigational medicine Cladribine Tablets. MS Ireland welcomes the news that cladribine has been approved by the CHMP. Ava Battles, Chief Executive, says, “The development of new medications such as cladribine is of crucial importance in the fight against relapsing remitting MS, and offers hope to those living with the condition. We hope that this new medication will be made available as a treatment option to people with relapsing remitting MS in Ireland as soon as possible.”. MS Ireland will closely follow developments regarding the availability of cladribine in Ireland and will keep our members informed of any updates. More information on the process for making new medications available in Ireland can be found in our Briefing Document."																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705231728716775701/Breaking-Down-the-Canadian-Proactive-Cohort-for-People-Living-with-MS---CanProCo-----Blog---MS-Society-of-Canada	"Part I: Heidi’s journey with MS. Having had multiple sclerosis (MS) for over 18 years, I feel like I’ve experienced every documented and undocumented MS symptom. I’ve struggled with this disease through nearly every major life event so far – elementary school, high school, university and I have even had to change my career plans. MS has had a huge impact on my life. From age 12 to my early 20s, it was very hard to find solace in the MS Society of Canada and my local MS clinic because I was quite young compared to everyone around me. I also grew up in a rural setting, which didn’t have many support options. My medications made me quite ill, but I felt I had to endure the pain and side effects because if I didn’t, I’d get worse. Despite my best efforts, I still lost my vision numerous times, had vertigo, no balance, partial paralysis, the list goes on. To put it plainly, I got worse. People – even fellow MS’ers – may look at me now and think I am fine and that I don’t understand what they’re going through. But trust me, I really do. I’ve had optic neuritis numerous times and so many flare-ups, I’ve lost count. I have also had to change my medication at least three times. I had lost hope in the clinic and the Society until one day I just started taking better care of myself and treating my body better – inside and out. But what I didn’t realize was that while I was changing, so was the MS Society. They started to listen to patients more, which reflected in their programs, services, and even the research they supported. They started looking not just at the biomedical research, which is important, but also investing more in research around more holistic approaches, with things like the Wellness Research Innovation Grant. How is it possible that with a progressive disease like MS, I feel better and stronger 18 years after my diagnosis? There are many things that influence how a person feels. I am on medication now that has fewer side effects, but I am also eating better, staying active, meditating and playing with my animals. This left me wondering: what really influences the progression of MS? Despite the prevalence of MS in Canada, we have yet to understand the mechanisms behind progression. The Canadian Proactive Cohort for People Living with MS (CanProCo) is aimed at doing just that. But what makes this study truly unique is its collaborative efforts, not just with other researchers, but also with people living with MS. It is my hope that this study will allow for a better understanding and more accurate depiction of what life with MS is really all about. People with MS are often placed into two categories – either they have progressive or relapsing-remitting MS. For a lot of people living with MS, a snapshot is taken at the moment of data collection (usually at your yearly appointment) and that is all until your next check-up in a year. That’s one of the things that makes the CanProCo unique. This research project has the potential to be a game changer because a lot of information is being collected over a duration of time. What’s even more fascinating, is that not all the information is purely biomedical. The study looks to examine you from both the inside and the outside so factors like environment, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and others will be considered as well. Not only has the study itself been carefully crafted to examining all of these aspects, but the researchers are willing and open to inviting the many perspectives of people who are affected by MS. Instead of a one-time appointment, participants will be followed for at least five years and the patient’s voice will be heard in a genuine and safe manner. The CanProCo has the potential to reach many Canadians living with MS – some of whom may not feel they’ve had a chance to share their story or that their MS community doesn’t understand them. This study has the opportunity to be very powerful and make an impact in influencing further change in people’s lives. Everyone has an MS story that is uniquely their own. Now researchers want to be part of yours too."

But not new to being sick. I had colorectal cancer fought for 5 years and my fair share of health issues. However recently all my issues are pointing towards MS-. Major spasms in rib cage like a Charlie horse even waking up at night with them. Feet legs ankles hands arms fingers ache and feel swollen and stuck super stiff they also get pins and needles and feel very hot. Sleepiness for 5 days straight. Tripping and stairs are terribly hard. Every joint hurts. my questions are this-. 1- I recently had an mri without contrast of my lower back. Nothing was mentioned of lesions. Would they only be able to see them with contrast? 2- I had a brain mri scan one year ago with contrast and nothing was mentioned with lesions. Could lesions grown in a year? 3- I just had a full body PET/CT scan with contrast to check and see if my cancer has spread. This also mentioned nothing about lesions. would these tests have shown ms? Or no? I Feel like a total freak asking for more testing but I’m not sure if the proper testing was done for MS.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4704994678659467090/M.I.A.-but-now-here's-an-update	"For those who have been conversing with me over the years (a few that come to mind: mamabug, marti, koko, julesa, seasha, and more ... I might have spelled some of those wrong), here's an update. You probably know me well enough by now to know that I disappear for a while, so I'm sorry if I missed anything that you've said to me!! Mamabug - your exercise check in comes to mind! I just got so overwhelmed last fall. Last september I DID go to the appointment with the resident neuro that was overseen by the head neuro that was/is an MS specialist, and that was the first MS specialist I've been able to see [I live 3 hours or more away from any MS specialist]. I left there SO DISCOURAGED by how I was treated [they were both very nice, but that's not the issue]. It just seemed like the resident neuro was really excited about getting to the bottom of my issues, but then the head guy came in and shot everything down. Instead of getting updated MRI scans like the resident neuro suggested, he said I needed some small fiber nerve test (the name escapes me). He also did some blood work for things like sjogren's and a few more autoimmune diseases that can show up in bloodwork. I looked everything up when I got back to the van (my friend drove me) and I literally fit NONE of them ... maybe I had one symptom from each, but it just proved to me that he did not listen to a word I said. To add insult to injury, he set the next appointment for 4 months. In my mind I'm thinking, ""4 months! That's 1/3 of a year away!"" Geesh. I already have anxiety about going ... and 4 months makes it easy to talk myself out of going. I was so stressed out, frustrated, anxious, discouraged, etc. All the tests came back negative (no surprise there), and I opted out of the follow up appointment. I just couldn't do it; it didn't ""feel right"" to me. In the meantime, I was finally approved for medicaid for disabled people. My GP gave me a referral to an MS center in St. Louis - Dr Green [MS Specialist]. My appointment with Dr Green was last week. This time instead of crying for frustration and discouragement, I cried for thankfulness. I have NEVER so far in this journey had a doctor that understood everything I was saying and going through, and in fact she could explain it better than me. She was shocked at how no one has gotten to the bottom of my problems. I reminded her that it's partially my fault for getting frustrated over and over again and giving up for years at a time before trying again. She felt like my frustration was justified because of all the feet-dragging and brick walls. She was also shocked that I have only had one scan of my neck and spine, and it was over 6 years ago. She said most of my symptoms would show activity in my spine, not my brain, so why has no one ordered an updated scan?!?!?! She actually seemed upset about it. I could understand her, she was thorough, and I liked her personality. I felt at ease with her, which really helped my issues with confusion and anxiety around doctors. Of course my friend was with me too - I always bring him so he can remember what was said and help add to the conversation. He liked her just as much as I did. She said she was going to get to the bottom of this once and for all. If it's MS, let's get it diagnosed. If it's not MS, let's figure it out and get that diagnosed. She told me to set up the neck and spine MRI for 2 weeks, and then set up an appointment with her right afterward. So, on the 14th I go in for the scans and then see her right after the scans at 11:30. That appointment with her will include the general neuro exam since all we did was talk during the first appointment. Could this be the end of it all?!?!? I sure hope so. Well, there it is. My walking continues to get worse, but with smart planning I can still [usually] get through my day ok. Lots of breaks and rest. Sometimes though I do have to rest pretty much all day. I try to get up and do something every hour or two, but sometimes that is too much. My son is fixing up a house for me that should be ready in a few months. Everything in it will pretty much be new, and will be set up just for me. I'm excited! We're all hoping it will make my life more peaceful. Though I am in my own place right now, it is still what we call ""grand central station"" - a hub of activity from my family that live on the same property. People come in on a whim, which usually interrupts the flow of my day and confuses me. I'll be moving to a whole new property where my youngest will be living, but our houses will be a good distance apart (I won't even be able to see his house from my house). My house will no longer be the center of activity, and my day will be much quieter. We all think a season of quiet will be really good for me. I used to be so social and love to host meals. I miss that, but oh well. That's just how life goes ... go with the flow, right?! That's all for now I guess. Thanks for your encouragement over the years! Hopefully soon I'll be out of limbo. Not officially diagnosed due to non-MS-specific spots on MRIs, but the neurologists all agree it's MS. January 2019: finally saw an MS specialist worth seeing. Maybe we'll get to the bottom of this. EDSS of 5.5, sometimes 6.0."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4704623429281237325/Study:-Medicare-rules-increase-out-of-pocket-costs-of-MS-drugs	"Medicare patients with multiple sclerosis face skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs for therapies due to complicated insurance rules that force them to pick up an increasing share of the cost, according to new research. Despite recent efforts to constrain escalating costs, researchers with OHSU and the OHSU/Oregon State University College of Pharmacy in Portland, Oregon, found trends in insurance coverage that restrict access and saddle patients with increasing patient costs. Medicare beneficiaries without low-income subsidies can expect to spend $6,894 a year out of pocket for treatment of MS, concludes a study published in the February issue of the journal Health Affairs . ""It's a dysfunctional market that lacks the typical incentives for most other consumer products,"" said lead author Daniel Hartung, Pharm.D., M.P.H., associate professor in the OHSU/OSU College of Pharmacy. ""Aside from the public optics, there are few incentives for companies not to raise prices. Most intermediaries in the drug distribution channel, including drug companies, benefit from higher prices."" High prices negatively affect patients, even with insurance, because patient out-of-pocket costs are often directly tied to undiscounted drug list prices. Additionally, rising prices for MS therapies also seemed to correlate to increased use of restrictive policies by Medicare pharmacy plans. In one telling example, researchers documented how patients who are prescribed the only generic drug in one class - glatiramer acetate - will pay more out of pocket than patients using any of the other brand-name drugs in the same class. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 modified Medicare rules to reduce out-of-pocket costs for individuals through increased discounts provided by brand-name drug manufacturers. However, this change left individuals who use generic drugs with higher out-of-pocket costs for certain generic products. ""This is a pernicious effect of the release of a generic and an unfortunate effect of Medicare rules,"" said co-author Dennis Bourdette, M.D., professor and chair of neurology in the OHSU School of Medicine. The authors noted that a proposal by the Trump administration would reduce this incentive disparity between brand-name and generic drugs. Depending on drug utilization patterns, the authors expect the administration's suggested changes would reduce total out-of-pocket spending for beneficiaries. The study follows on previous research into the high cost of MS drugs led by Hartung and Bourdette. ""MS is emblematic of many chronic conditions whose treatment increasingly involves the use of high-cost specialty drugs that are often rigidly managed,"" the authors write. Researchers also examined changes in requirements for prior authorization, a common insurance company strategy intended to manage or limit access to certain drugs. The study noted that rates of pre-authorization have increased from 61 percent in 2007 to as high as 90 percent in 2016. Yet narrowing options doesn't necessarily work for MS patients, the authors write, noting American Academy of Neurology guidelines stress patients and providers should have access to all therapies because the effect varies from patient to patient. And, despite an increase in the number of therapies available to treat MS, the out-of-pocket cost to patients has continued to escalate. ""Despite increases in the number and diversity of disease-modifying therapies for MS, prices have risen rapidly over the past two decades,"" the authors write. ""The rise in high coinsurance cost-sharing models, coupled with escalating drug prices, means that patients will increasingly face prohibitive out-of-pocket spending."" Funding for this research was supported by OHSU's Clinical and Translational Science Award Program, Grant No. UL1TR002369. Hartung, Bourdette and co-author Kirbee Johnston, M.P.H., are supported by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society."

Researchers from Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin have discovered how the body initiates repair mechanisms to limit the extent of any damage to this sheath. Their findings, which provide a basis for the development of new drugs to treat multiple sclerosis, have been published in Nature Communications . Multiple sclerosis is the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Estimates suggest that more than 200,000 people are affected by the disease in Germany alone. People with multiple sclerosis experience vision and sensory problems, as well as impaired coordination or even paralysis. These symptoms are caused by the disruption of nerve impulses in either the brain or the spinal cord. This disruption occurs when the body's immune system attacks the myelin sheath, which is wrapped around the body's nerve fibers and provides electrical insulation. When the myelin sheath is no longer intact, communication between nerve cells is impaired. Researchers across the globe are searching for new ways to repair the myelin sheath and, in doing so, are looking to reduce neurological symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis. Researchers from Charité have now moved a decisive step closer to this goal. Charité's research team decided to take a closer look at the body's innate ability to heal itself, knowing that, under certain conditions, the central nervous system is capable of repairing damage to the myelin sheath . Specific molecular signals enable stem cells to differentiate into myelin repair cells (oligodendrocytes), which reside in a small stem-cell niche in the brain. Once they leave this niche, these repair cells migrate to where myelin damage has occurred in order to restore the affected nerve cells' electrical insulation. Until now, very little had been known about the molecular signals responsible for initiating this myelin regeneration mechanism. ""We have found that the Chi3l3 protein plays a central role in the body's capacity to produce new myelin-forming oligodendrocytes,"" says the study's first author, Dr. Sarah-Christin Staroßom of Charité's Institute for Medical Immunology. A researcher at the NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence and the Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Dr. Staroßom explains the protein's role as follows: ""The Chi3l3 protein initiates the differentiation of neural stem cells into myelin repair cells, which restore the electrical insulation around damaged nerve cells ."" Using a mouse model , the research team were able to show that a reduction in Chi3l3 levels in the brain significantly impairs the body's capacity for oligodendrocyte production, while a Chi3l3 infusion leads to an increase in the production of myelin repair cells. The same reaction was observed during an in vitro experiment using human cells . ""We hope to use this knowledge to develop a new generation of drugs that can be used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis,"" explains Dr. Staroßom. ""As a next step, we will study in greater detail whether Chi3l3 or related proteins can be used to reduce the neurological symptoms of patients with multiple sclerosis. :::::::."

Hey there, I’m currently on copaxone as I like the safety profile. My ms is mild with only sensory symptoms when I’ve had relapses. As I’m a single parent, I want to remain healthy for a as long as possible. I’ve been thinking of changing to one of the newer and supposedly more effective drugs but I’m very concerned about the cancer and PML risks.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702813046349079078/New-and-Concerned	"Good Evening Everyone,. My name is Jason and I am a band director at a large high school in Florida. I am 32 years old. I have had some very strange symptoms for about a year. However, looking back at least four years, MS can explain a lot of things that have happened in my life. I am not sure what I should do. I am looking for guidance on what to do. Who should I see, would they even take me seriously? I have the following symptoms:. 1. Random patches of numbness that come and go. The most likely places are on my hands and feet (Peripheral Neuropathy) This is always like a half numbness. It is very annoying. It has gotten to the point where my hands and feet are almost always half numb. It seems when I touch things or hold things whatever is being touched turns numb as well. I have had these random patches of numbness just about everywhere on my body at some point. I also have an altered state of touch. Very strange sensations. 2. I have always been highly intelligent. However, I have noticed in the last year that I often have brain fog. My recall of information has become poor. Especially words. I know exactly what I want to say, I can see it in my mind but it never comes out. Oddly enough it comes out as something completely different. For example, last night I went to a restaurant and I asked my fiance where she found the forks. What came out was ""Where did you find the straws?"" I say it with such conviction because I am so sure of what I wanted to say but it is wrong. This sort of thing has been happening with increased frequency and it appears to be getting worse as time goes on. Furthermore, I will be in class teaching and writing on the whiteboard simultaneously but what I am saying and what I am writing are two completely different things. 3. Vision issues. I had 20/15 vision for most of my life until about five years ago or so I started losing my distance vision. In the last year I feel like my vision has depreciated at an alarming rate. It is no longer just distance vision but all vision. My right eye is especially bad. In the right eye it almost seems as if colors are washed out and greyish. Furthermore, I feel like I have lost some peripheral vision. 4. Fine motor skills. I feel like I am slowly losing my fine motor skills. Little things like texting on a phone and typing this message seem much more difficult than they used to. I have slowed down significantly and make a plethora of mistakes. Things I have done so much just feel strange. 5. Movement. I have noticed a significant decrease in my walking speed and my gait seems to have changed. I am well aware of it but it is nothing I am consciously doing. This is not significant but noticeable. I feel much stiffer than I used to. 6. Involuntary twitching. My newest symptom is involuntary twitching. It started in my right eyelid about three weeks ago and sometimes spreads down my cheeks. This is intermittent and does not happen all the time but definitely a neurological issue. 7. Dizziness and vertigo. This one comes and goes but sometimes it can be pretty severe. Sometimes it happens while I am driving and I fear for my life. This is one of those symptoms that I had four years ago that could have been my first episode. I had about three months of debilitating dizziness and vertigo. I had to sit down at work while teaching. It was just awful. Doctors could not explain it but they certainly didn't do anything outside of a blood test. 8. Other cognitive deficiencies. I have noticed it is much more difficult to focus and have developed some ADD tendencies. I used to be able to multitask and get stuff done better than most people I know. It is getting harder. Remembering names is becoming an issue sometimes as well. Names of people I see and communicate with every day like my students. 9. Pain. I have had numerous injuries in my life that can explain pain but most of them are really old injuries. I have more pain than someone my age should ever have to endure. I do not know if this is related or not. Bowel problems. I am almost always constipated and I drink a lot of water and eat fairly well. I currently have a recurrent cholesteatoma in my left ear that needs to be surgically removed soon but it does not explain any of these symptoms as it is not in brain. What do you all think and what should I do from here? Any advice would be really appreciated. I have seen my primary physician and they basically turned me away. Thank you for your time!"

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4712370275396497605/Heres-how-not-to-be-an-idiot---like-me-----Page-2	"Hello Mable,. Why did Giavononni wait to tell a patient that brain loss volume leads to disability? I have no idea; I can only speculate. But I congratulate him for talking about it now. His website has a monthly Q & A section where that question can be asked. Brain atrophy as a clinical endpoint in DMT trials has only been introduced in the last few years. Before recently not much attention was given brain loss volume. Unlikely that many neuros have discussed it with their patients, unfortunately. However, going forward I believe brain atrophy will be discussed in the context of which DMT to choose; it is just now beginning to be recognized as a vitally important factor relative to disability. Gilenya is better at reducing brain loss volume (BLV) than most DMTs although I personally would not choose Gilenya if I had MS. But the particular patient mentioned was NEDA on it, Mable, so for her it was/is effective. All the other DMTs for MS are worse than Gilenya in reducing BLV except those Giavononni listed … HSCT and Lemtrada 0.2-0.25%, Tysabri 0.25-0.3%, Ocrevus 0.35%, Gilenya at 0.4%. So, what should this patient on Gilenya be taking instead of Gilenya? That is a tough question because she is NEDA on it and her response to the others cannot be precisely predicted. With DMTs there are patients who develop neutralizing antibodies which render a DMT useless or even counterproductive. HSCT is not widely available even though, IMO it is clearly the most successful DMT. Next on my list is Tysabri; not Lemtrada even though some do very, very well on Lemtrada. With Lemtrada most people (but not all) will battle significant secondary immunity problems. That is why Lemtrada gives me pause. With those thoughts in mind, Tysabri would be my choice whether I was JCV positive, or negative. Before going on dose extension with Tysabri (btw, convincing the neuro literally nearly took fist-fighting; our arguments were that intense, he finally caved, learned, or something and agreed that dose extension de-risks for PML. The lesson here is that sometimes you actually have to fight or change doctors for what you are convinced of, as Linda explained in her post) and before switching to Ocrevus my spouse had received more infusions of Tysabri than anyone in the world according to her neurologist. Ocrevus is a very, very good DMT but not quite as effective as Tysabri in reducing fatigue and BLV. The PML aspect often scares patients away from Tysabri when MS progression should be leading MSers toward Tysabri, IMO. IMO, HSCT is the best option. But if HSCT is not available, Tysabri is the next best, IMO. Please keep in mind not every DMT works well for every patient. My opinion is based on experience in my household and results found in DMT trial and real-world data. Isn’t it fun choosing a DMT? It would challenge Solomon. Choices can be narrowed down by prioritizing what is most important to an individual but it still can seem like a crap shoot. Good luck and certainly, you have my best wishes! Oh, one last point… we all lose brain volume as we age. In one scientific study the BLV per year was “0.20% at the age of 35 years increasing to 0.52% at 70 years” in healthy subjects. Often, BLV in MS is listed at 0.7% and higher. So, the best DMTs get that rate at very near normal. Recall even Gilenya was at 0.4%. In the near future, BLV will be used as a marker for how well a DMT is doing for a particular patient, I’m certain."																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4700689093432693714/Special-Threads-For-VIP-Members	"Originally Posted by IntoDust .... I see your point, but I look at it a little differently. If we knew someone who needed to use a wheelchair, yet kept refusing to admit the need for one, eventually we would stop trying to pick them up off the floor - especially if they were adamant that they didn't need help. How many times would people be willing to break their backs for someone who not only doesn't appreciate it, but refuses to acknowledge it? I have reached out to people on this board that rebuffed my offer of help and /or ignored,or even refused to acknowledge what I was trying to say. As I have a strict budget on my use of 'spoons' I felt that it was on them at that point. And so I bowed out of their concerns. If they figure it out then great, if not then I feel that I have invested all that I am willing to invest. At that point I find somewhere else to invest my interest - or even start a thread about something that interest me. Originally Posted by IntoDust. The difference, I think, is that while you can ignore numb patches or tingling, it is another thing to try to ignore symptoms that affect how you function - whether this is physical or mental, motor or cognitive. Some symptoms have a real impact on quality of life even if they are invisible. The VIP that you are talking about actually has, IMHO, managed to find a way to survive. A little denial? But she is living a productive full life to the best of her ability, and is even 'happy' at times now. After 25 years MS dx, most people wouldn't guess that I have MS - or any other chronic disease (I have 3). Do I ignore these conditions? Yeah, I suppose that I do most of the time. I take my meds, eat correctly and make an effort to move every day. And I too live a full productive life. I am not in denial. I will speak about MS, diabetes or thyroid problems to anybody that has a desire to listen, but it is not my focus in life. I have too much else going on that is, at this point in my life, more important to me. It took me about a year to learn to function after my MS dx (but a year just happens to be the AVERAGE amount of time) and there are still times when I find myself starting the 'grief cycle' all over again. At least now I know what to expect and so these dark periods don't last as long as they have in the past. That lesson comes from experience and acceptance. Unfortunately those are traits that each person has to acquire on their own - in their own time. I am sorry that you do not feel safe to post, and that you have felt slighted by other members on the board. I apologize that I haven't responded to more of your posts, but honestly, if I feel that I have nothing to contribute then I simply read. I would rather not give out misinformation, or even worse incorrect info . I mainly post about my personal experiences or offer moral support. I try to keep in mind the principle behind this board rather than the personalities involved. MSWorld was created by people with MS to help people with MS. Think about it like going to an office party. You go for whatever reason, but will most likely NOT interact with everybody there. There may even be some things going on that you chose not to participate in, but that does not mean that you can't still have a good time. That is too simplistic and not really dead on, but maybe you can understand what I am trying to convey. Hope to see you around and looking forward to more posts by you IntoDust ."																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4700638695122931468/MS-Ireland--::-Helping-Everyone-Affected-by-Multiple-Sclerosis	"MS Ireland  ::. Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Why I “Look So Good"" Thursday January 24 2019 10:00 AM. This week Trevis Gleason deals with familiar, often unwelcome, phrases people with MS hear very often. Nearly everyone who has MS has heard “You don’t look sick” or “But you look so good….” Well, I’ll tell you why. It’s well into the third week of January and I’m still hearing a lot of “Happy New Year” greetings. It’s not because people are stuck in a rut or have forgotten that they’ve seen me about town. It’s the first time I’ve been seen by many in our close-knit community. I’ve had a tough go of it since just after Christmas. MS and MS-related setbacks have kept me mostly at home for the past several weeks. What I’ve been hearing alongside those New Year greetings has been the acknowledgement that I have been missing from the everyday life of the town. Many suppose that I’ve been away on holidays or traveling for work. I’ve come to realise that this is the flipside of the “You look so good” coin. We ‘look so good’, not because we are ‘good’ all the time; rather because we only get out when we are on the good side of the MS spectrum. Firstly, the broader public doesn’t see our invisible symptoms. They also don’t see the effort – oft Herculean – to get ourselves out the door and into the community. The people we meet also don’t realise that our interaction with them may be the only one we have for the whole day. It’s not a full trip to the shops we’re making, we’re simply out to get milk before we must return for an anesthesia-like recovery nap. Then, as I’ve experienced this week, people just don’t realise that we’re not out all of the time. People who see us at work mightn’t know that the seven or eight hours we are with them are the only hours in the day when we aren’t wrecked beyond recognition. That the anti-fatigue meds mask to the world the truth of what we felt like before the meds kicked in. Those loan-shark meds will be demanding heavy interest when they wear off in the evening. Finally, the world only sees us as looking good because that’s what they want to see. They’re not looking very hard if they don’t see than I’m not ‘okay’. I know this doesn’t fit for everyone out there. The truth, however, is that our world needs to see that everything is okay. Those who know us moderately well may have known us ‘before’ and it’s important that we’re fine because if something like MS happens to them, they need to feel like they’ll be fine too. Our disease makes people face their own frailties. It’s the same reason cancer was whispered about, if it were ever talked about, in decades past. People don’t want to know that it could happen to them… as a species, we get spooked very easily. Part of the reason people see us as they do is because of the face we put on for the world . There as many reasons we put on the “I’m fine” mask as there are people living with MS. We do it because we need to stay employed, because we don’t want our children/spouses/family/friends to worry, because we don’t want to admit to ourselves that it’s got as bad as it has. That list could go on for pages…. I can’t (or at least don’t) give my list to people who mention that I look good or ask if I’ve been away. I’d be a very off-putting bore were I to spout off all of the above information to the casual acquaintance! It’s one of the reasons the MS & Me blog and other places where we can be ourselves with others who simply get it are so important. We’re not always fine, well, okay, or even good … but that doesn’t stop us from trying to be those things. I just wish we’d all do that a little more for ourselves than only for those in our lives who need them from us. Wishing you and your family the best of health.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4699981416487783503/Discussions---MS-Connection	"Jan 21, 2019 10:09 PM. That Hug *. Can u describe it? For me, I dont know if its the hug. I dont know if its THE ms hug. Ill describe it. My muscles through out kinda contract. Its not painful, just uncomfortable. It comes in waves. They contract for a few se onds, relax for a few seconds. If I take baclofen, it takes 20+ minutes to stop. If I dont, it continues for hours. Then when it stops on its own, I am sore for a few days. I would imagine its from the constant contracting and relaxing. Mind you, I didnt get a prescription for baclofen until a year ago. The stuff has been great for me. I dont even have an official diagnosis yet either, I went to the neuro today, and he wants an mri. That has been scheduled for May. My bladder has been getting a tad worse. It takes a bit longer to start. My legs still like to give on me. My balance has gotten better. My muscle spasms and cramps have lessened since getting the baclofen. Its not 100%. It still wakes me here and there. I still get numbness and tingling. That seems to have stayed the same. But I am really curious how the ms hug feels for others. I am not even sure what I feel is an ms hug. Jan 26, 2019 7:45 PM. Hi DR2018,. I have yet to be diagnosed, however I have the exact same spasms... I think it is the hug, but I’m not sure. It is strange though. I have a clear MRI, the ‘hug’ happens often. Went to Emergency once DURING the spasms, they continued for 90-minutes. Every nurse saw it, they were all concerned. Dr finally came in, 2-hours later and he said the video i showed him was common and he is not worried. He also told me that the spasms are not an emergency, i should see my Neurologist. Neurologist knows ALL my other symptoms, but because of clear MRI, she has said she can confidently say she RULED OUT MS, and that all my symptoms are due to stress. I am so angry! Am I also having an MS hug? Feb 11, 2019 7:43 PM. I am 'hopeful' ha ha you all get in the habit of laughing. Finding the humor has taken me a lifetime, couldnt think of anything better to do! I am also glad you appreciate the fun of it all. Think funny."

Her positive attitude and bright smile filled the room as she told me about her job as a grade school teacher and the new apartment she just moved into with her boyfriend of seven years. “We are a great team,” she said. “Little did he know that his law school wouldn't be the biggest challenge we'd face as a couple.”. Stephanie was diagnosed about a year ago with multiple sclerosis (MS), and behind her beautiful eyes and strong spirit, I could sense her pain at the discovery of the most recent spinal cord lesions after she complained to her doctors of new nerve pain in her feet. She will be starting steroid infusions in a few weeks, and together we hope to design a nutrition and lifestyle plan that will support her health and healing, and preserve her quality of life. Nerve pain is hard to grasp and relentless in its unpredictability. The nerve damage associated with MS has been linked to causative factors including dysbiosis of the gut microbe, autoimmune responses, and increased inflammation, all leading to an attack on the nervous system by the body's own immune cells. -------.

Pride and self-reliance dissipate remarkably quickly when you find yourself splayed on the floor and you no longer have the capacity to get up. In extremis, I then ask for help. But if I’d asked earlier, the whole farrago probably could have been avoided. This lesson took a while to sink in; indeed, I’m not sure I’ve made it out of kindergarten yet! Yes, this disease does infantilize. I can no longer put on my shoes. Each new strategy to do so worked for a while, but eventually, they all failed. I suppose that if I started the day before, I’d have a chance. I’d forget why I was putting them on, but by then the challenge would be enough. I still find it weird as a 61-year-old bloke to watch my 22-year-old son slapping them on in seconds. Hey, I used to beat him at tennis. He was only 8, and I didn’t have MS yet. Give me a break; it was still becoming increasingly difficult! So, yes, I’ve become more receptive of asking for help and not feeling guilty.

Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant is better than disease-modifying therapies (DMT) at reducing the risk of disease progression in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ), results from the MIST clinical trial show. The study “ Effect of Nonmyeloablative Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation vs Continued Disease-Modifying Therapy on Disease Progression in Patients With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis – A Randomized Clinical Trial ” was published in the journal JAMA . While RRMS patients may respond to immune suppressive therapies, in order to be effective these need to be applied early in the disease course, i.e., while MS is mainly an immune-mediated and inflammatory disease. :::::::.

Thursday January 17 2019 11:02 AM. This New Year, the MS and Me team will bring you more of the things you love as well as a few things you didn’t know you wanted. As we close the third week of 2019, it’s probably time to sweep “Happy New Year” away for another 11½ months. That said, we’d like to take this opportunity to let you know what you might expect from your MS blog this year. First, we wave a grateful goodbye to one of our original blog team, Helen . We wish her all the best as she continues on a career path she was able to take-up again in 2018. Her thoughtful posts, such as the very popular MS & the 2019 Budget , will be missed as much as her positive yet realistic outlook on living with multiple sclerosis. Good luck, Helen! The rest of the MS & Me blog team will look the same for the coming year with some additional guests. The blog itself (as well as the MS Ireland webpage), however, may look different by the end of the year. We are undertaking a long-awaited rework of the website and will take advantage of the opportunity to make the MS & Me blog easier to find, navigate, read and reply. We can’t say exactly when it will happen but, suffice it to say from the prototypes we’ve seen, when it does change, you’ll know! This year we’ve decided to expand on a popular feature we ran a couple of years back. Most months, beginning in February, we will have two bloggers – one man and one woman – co-write a piece on a topic which may have different takes depending on the person with MS’s sex. We’re calling the series “He said – She said”. Topics are set to include such hot buttons as dating, romance, having children after diagnosis, finances and more. We hope you enjoy and engage with our bloggers on these interesting topics viewed from different perspectives. We’re also going to delve into some of the “tough stuff” this year. We all grieve losses in this life. With MS we seem to have to go through some form of the grieving process every time we lose something else to the disease. We’ll have a series of blogs on the stages of grief for you this year as well. We’ll highlight some of the major MS events happening in Ireland and around the world as well as sharing our tips and thoughts of living your best life with this damnable disease along for the ride. The editorial team of MS & Me hope that you’ll enjoy the topics we’ve set out for the year. The cadre of bloggers you’ve come to read hope that you’ll continue to comment, share, and discuss the subjects with your family and friends. Knowledge is, after all, power. And the more of our allies who have the knowledge, the more power we as an MS community will have. Wishing you and your family the best of health.

When a 1 kilogram object (we’ll call it a squeeze bottle of mayonnaise in this case) is knocked from a cupboard shelf (which is, let’s say, about 2 meters high), it falls. The rate of descent reaches 6.26 meters per second, or 22.54 kilometers per hour (just over 14 miles per hour) — that’s 19.6 joules or 14.46 feet per pound — before hitting the floor … or one blogger’s big toe. By the way, that takes all of 0.64 seconds to happen. Without the math, I’m trying to say that 2.2 pounds feels a lot heavier when it strikes your foot from head high … and it hurts like all the expletives ! The Many Varieties of MS-Related Pain. After several days, it still hurts, but there is a bit of comfort in the feeling of pain. Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) can relate to this bit of wonderment with “real” pain, since we experience so many versions of phantom pain (pain for no reason at all) or other sensory disruptions that manifest in what can only be described as pain. There was a time not that long ago when pain was not recognized by clinicians as a symptom of MS. Thankfully, it’s pretty rare to run across a doctor who will not accept this today. If you do run across one of those doctors, run away . We know that there are many types of MS pain , and none of them are pleasant. From sizzling nerve pain to the electric shock of Lhermitte’s sign , from the feeling of icy-cold water droplets falling on you to molten lead dripping, from pins and needles to tens of thousands of beestings … we know pain. RELATED: Treating Chronic Pain in Multiple Sclerosis. The Mysterious Origins of MS Pain. The thing about those feelings of great discomfort compared with the continued throbbing of my hallux (I had no idea that’s what the big toe was called either) is that we cannot say exactly what causes them. Not in ordinary terms, anyway. Nerve pain, phantom pain, pins and needles — there isn’t an injury we can point to and say, “That’s why it hurts.” When a tub of mayo strikes a foot, however, that’s pain with an obvious explanation, and I’ve found some appreciation in it. I am in pain so often because of my MS. Sometimes it’s an annoyance, but more often it alters the course of my day. Without an abrasion or contusion, it’s hard for me to even get my head around it. I know it hurts. I know the theory and science of why I experience the sensation of pain, but it’s sort of like understanding the concept of gravitational waves and space-time yet doing great disservice to physics by trying to explain them. RELATED: When Multiple Sclerosis Causes Skin Symptoms. It’s Nice to Feel Normal, Even When It Hurts. This pain doesn’t need a complex explanation. A heavy thing fell on my foot, and it hurt. It hurt a lot, and it still hurts. There’s some comfort in feeling a real feeling, the way everyone else in the world does. It’s an odd experience, this wonderment at feeling pain, odd but somehow normal. And it’s nice to feel normal once in a while. Wishing you and your family the best of health.

Here's an article that explains this - https://www.mstrust.org.uk/a-z/ms-hug.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4697507930823458993/Discussions---MS-Connection	"Jan 13, 2019 4:55 PM. Questions about numbness/tingling and muscle tightness. Hey everyone,. I've already talked with my neurologist about most of these things, so this is more of a ""can anyone relate?"" kind of post. Sometimes I wonder if I overthink things too much ever since my diagnosis of CIS (Clinically Isolated Syndrome) in 2018. But then again, it would make sense of a lot of things. I've been on Copaxone since last November. I do get numbness and tingling. It doesn't last more than a few minutes at a stretch usually, but it will go and come back repeatedly throughout the day. It's usually in my feet or hands, but occasionall other places like legs, back, face, etc. I read an article about paroxymal symptoms which was really interesting and relatable. I also sometimes get pinprick type of sensations in the same areas. I've noticed that it sometimes seems triggered by that body part being cold (especially my feet). Another trigger seems to be things taht would make one's hand/feet ""fall asleep"" but that seems to happen very easily/frequently for me (holding a book, sitting a certain way, etc). I'm wondering how much of this might be the lesions and how much might just be ""normal"" but I experience it daily. I've also been dealing with RLS for quite some time. I finally talked with my doctor about it and she had me try iron since it was slightly low. That hasn't relly helped unfortunately. Sometimes it's just an intense urge to move my legs, sometimes the feel really achy and/or weird. It's often worse around my cycle. I've also noticed recently that I'm tensing up my legs (especially lower legs) unconsiously. When I realise it, I relax them, but it seems as soon as I'm not thinking about it they're tense again. Anyone have similar experiences? Anything, especially non-medicinal, you found helpful for RLS? Jan 13, 2019 8:42 PM. RLS-please SERIOUSLY try to drink more water. Sounds so anti-medical or something you would read on Facebook (believe or not- I’m not on FB). i only give suggestions from experience and/or others experience. this RLS is so simple- it will pass😊✌🏼."																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4696443312209461371/Great-results-so-far-on-Tysabri	"I was diagnosed Summer of 2017 with RRMS at age 42. I'm a surgeon and stopped operating for a few weeks with arm weakness and other crazy symptoms of my first relapse. Started Plegridy and was feeling better until Spring of 2018. I looked normal and was full time surgeon, but I did back off my normal surgery schedule some. I still struggled some with my self confidence that I needed to see patients and I worried if my MS would stay quiet and allow me to continue to operate. Spring of 2018, I started feeling the fatigue again, then intermittent spasticity on my right side, and then left eye optic neuritis started. It reached a peak on a Monday morning clinic. I was seeing a patient when the spasticity affected my neck muscles and I couldn't talk. The emotions flooded me and I was stuck in spasticity in my office chair. The MRI that week showed progression of brain lesions and 2 new lesions in cervical spine. My neurologist felt with the progression that we should move to new medicine. I'm JCV- and he recommended Tysabri. I missed about a month of work before symptoms improved that I could safely operate again. I've been on Tysabri since August 2018. I have zero side effects. Since October I've felt the best I have since my diagnosis. I now get my infusion on a Friday morning. I leave the infusion office, take off my IV bandaid, and am operating 30 minutes later. Did a follow-up MRI this week. No active and no new lesions on brain. Best news is both cervical lesions are absolutely gone.

Thursday January 10 2019 12:45 PM. At the start of New Year 2019, Declan Groeger shares with us his plans for the year ahead. Read on for a plan of action we can all adapt to our own resolutions. 2019 is a new year; a year full of hopes and fears, a year full of aspirations and dreams and a year full of good intentions. But it is also a year that, without proper planning, will be filled with disappointments. John Heywood, an English playwright better known for phrases that are embedded in our psyche, is credited with the saying “Rome wasn’t built in a day” . This was modernised to the phrase “softly-softly-catchy-monkey” by Queen Victoria. Loosely translated, both these phrases mean that patience is important. The essential ingredients for success are realism, focus, planning and patience; each ingredient being of equal importance. Another trite adage alerts us to the importance of planning “By failing to prepare you are preparing to fail”, Benjamin Franklin. Realism is important for everyone but even more so for people living with Multiple Sclerosis; we must acknowledge our limitations and plan accordingly. To my way of thinking there is no point in targeting a climb to the summit of Mount Everest without setting a schedule of lesser achievements and waypoints on the journey. Focus is equally important. I find that maintaining focus for a long-term project can be difficult and to that end, I recommend the ‘buddy system’. Confide in someone; share your resolution and accept help and encouragement from your confidante. Write it down; having a goal in writing somehow makes it more real. Planning is essential and this ingredient incorporates patience. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry once said, ""A goal without a plan is just a wish"". Some goals seem much more difficult without intermediate targets and for me the inclusion of these waypoints make the challenge seem less onerous and more achievable; softly softly catchy monkey! A word of warning- planning should not be used as an excuse to procrastinate. Planning is essential but procrastination is the death knell for many good intentions. I’m only making one New Year resolution this year. In past years I would make a list and start off the New Year with the best of intentions and ultimately most, if not all, fell by the wayside. Time has passed and now more than 30 years after my diagnosis I have learned to be more realistic. I make one resolution and try to do it well. Attempting to do too much is foolish and this is true in any walk of life. Do less but do it well. My New Year resolution is to be kinder to myself. Why that one you might ask? The answer is simple; I haven’t been very kind to me and I need to be. What New Year Resolution have you adopted for 2019?"																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695027733542609969/The-Difficulty-and-Honor-of-Hearing-From-Those-Newly-Diagnosed-With-MS	"I received far, far too many messages in 2018 from my family, friends, friends of friends, and even people I’ve never met. The senders are always concerned, often bewildered, and sometimes quite worried. They ask for guidance; they seek advice; they long for credible resources. What they hope for more than anything is honesty … but they also hope for answers I cannot provide. These, of course, are people who get in touch because someone they know has recently been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) . I am honored that people reach out to me when looking for answers. It means — to me at least — that I am somehow meeting my goals of making the experiences and the information I share relatable and understandable to the broader MS audience. But I’m saddened at the number of newly diagnosed members who continue to be added to our club's roster. RELATED: New CDC Registry to Monitor MS Prevalence and Disease Trends. So Many People Are Unaware of the Resources Available to Them. I am overwhelmed by the number of people who want to help in any way they can but who are unaware of the resources available to them as people who care about someone with MS. These organizations, like so many others, aren’t just for people living with MS. They can help those who want to help those with the disease, too. Here’s but a partial list:. RELATED: MS Resources. An MS Diagnosis Affects You and Those Around You. When I’m approached about a particular MS symptom or coping strategy, I’m almost always able to offer up an article or two on the subject. This year, I will enter my 14th year of writing about living with multiple sclerosis. In that time, I've amassed quite a library of MS-related topics (just google “Trevis Gleason” and your MS topic of interest). But people are looking for more than a simple blog post or article. As many people with MS know, those first months after diagnosis are harrowing. What we may not know is that there are people who surround us — family, friends, coworkers, neighbors, teachers — who are having a difficult time with it in their own way. They need to know and understand some of the same things that the person with MS does. Namely that things will be all right. They won’t be the same; they’ll be different even if they don’t feel different. RELATED: The Wide-Ranging Impact of Multiple Sclerosis on My Social Circle. How to Help When Each Person’s MS Experience Is Different. Also, it’s important to know, particularly for those of us who get those calls and emails, that everyone’s journey with MS is different — just as each person is different. How I have found my way might not be the path for everyone. How one person with MS has done, taken, or experienced any one thing to make their life with multiple sclerosis a little bit better isn’t all that relevant. What’s better, I think, is for the lot of us to drop bread crumbs along our journey and leave a general direction that others may choose to follow. No one person’s path can be trod by another. The more crumbs on any particular topic, however, and a person new to our community can see generalities that have worked for many. RELATED: 10 Tips for People Newly Diagnosed With Multiple Sclerosis. I will continue to get those messages in 2019. Many readers of this column will as well. It’s important that we each offer what support we can at that moment. What is equally important is to steer those with MS or those who are concerned for someone with MS to communities who have helped us find our way as well. None of us got here alone, and no one should have to go it alone — in giving advice as well as living with a new diagnosis. Wishing you and your family the best of health.

Hi Maria, I haven’t been given any solution for my eyes from doctors. Glasses don’t help. the issue. It’s quite frusfrating. For my MS overall, I’ve begun eating healthier and am on Copaxone. I do struggle with tons of stress at my new job.. I know this can’t be good for my symptoms. Jan 06, 2019 5:04 PM. How we handle stress and frustration makes a significant difference in the progress of ms. Making the best of a bad situation is relevant. Making muscles tense all the time puts a burden on the body. It is up to you to find way that keep your body comfortable and your mind quiet. I stopped all disease modifying drugs and related ms prescriptions about three years ago. After being on betaseron for more than twenty five years I am at the stage where it does not help anymore and I have moved on to spms. So what, big deal, at almost 72 things are getting old, parts are slowing and life is moving in one direction, again so what, keeping myself with soft muscles, no matter what, and a quiet mind has the doctors impressed with my eyes, almost not noticing the neuritis, I can still walk, though like every part of ms, sometimes everything gives me trouble. I am having problems using my hands and arms and hemp oil and hemp cream have made dramatic relief as well as Vitamins and suppliments, even my strength has improved. Try googling the problem you have and see what homeopathic solutions are available. Ayurvedic medicine is a healthy choice for improving everything. Also know that most issues with ms are fleeting and do go away given time. Staying in the moment aids in seeing right now and not all the way down the road. New solutions appear all the time and wisdom is earned with age so being kind to yourself is a good rule, do everything you can to take really good care of yourself, be selfish about your well being and do your best to avoid regret, make your choices based upon whether or not you will regret it tomorrow, because regret is the best enemy of a better life with ms alongside stress and anxiety. Jan 06, 2019 8:41 PM. I appreciate your advice so much, Maria! I’m so glad you mentioned alternative ways to take care of your body. If you don’t mind me asking, did the doctors ever give you solutions for your neuritis, or did you just find the alternatives that worked without their help? I’m curious to know how doctors have dealt with other patients suffering from optic neuritis. I’ve seriously considered finding alternatives but all I’ve been told is that MS prescription drugs (namely, Copaxone) is the best way to go. Part of me believes there’s more I can and should do. I will definitely make a more conscious effort to relax and reduce my stress. I will especially be kinder to myself! I feel we need more of that period :). Jan 06, 2019 9:42 PM. I have always been put on steroids as pills or infusions, but at the same times I have been sooooo ill it was necessary to try to control the exacerbations. It took many years for my eyes to clear up. But I credit talking to my brain for part of it. I am a strong believer that the brain takes orders and does what we tell it to do. Both silently and out loud I ask my brain to 'fix it' and trust that it will, even though it may take some time. Brain fix my eyes. Of course some ailments leave so much damage it will take longer or may be impossible to repair. My brain doesnt listen or is unable when I ask it to lose weight, giggle. There are many posts about supplements people take.B1 zinc omega 3s are helpful for eyes. Jan 07, 2019 12:40 AM. Steroids definitely tore my body apart! I was placed on an IV with steroids for 2 hours each day during the first week after being diagnosed. Worst week by far! Couldn’t eat anything and broke out all over my body. I threw up pure liquid during the last days because my stomach was empty. I will definitely look into more information about supplements! I’ve been in a state of denial for the last 3 years but am finally ready to start helping myself. We’ll see how talking to my brain works. I’ll still give it a shot and sneak in the “lose weight” command because i definitely need to try after all this holiday food Hahahaha. you have been aich an amazing help,. I wish I would have been open to this sooner.. but it’s never too late to start making positive changes! Jan 07, 2019 12:55 AM. Thank you for sharing! I hadn’t heard of nystagmus before.. it must have been frightening to experience those symptoms for the first time! I also stopped driving because of my symptoms, but this was a personal choice. Although the last ophthalmologist told me they’d need to report that I’m not able to drive because of how poorly I performed on the vision exams. How was the transition for you when you stopped driving? Has it been difficult for you to explain your reason for not driving to others? Having to give up driving and sell my car has been one of the most difficult parts of my journey. Thankfully my husband is able and willing to drive me to and from work every day so I’m still very blessed :) Lyft/Uber can get expensive lol. Jan 07, 2019 8:12 AM. You may want to search for an MS specialist or a neuroopthamologist if you are not already seeing one. You can also read more about vision issues in our online brochure: Vision Problems. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call and speak to an MS Navigator at 1-800-344-4867, Monday through Friday. Warm Regards,. Jan 07, 2019 2:14 PM. Omg yes! Intravenous steroids messed me up too. It also made me nauseous and I couldn’t eat or stand the smell food. Are the steroids the only treatment you’ve received for your eye? Have the doctors given you an official diagnosis for the loss of vision (like optic neuritis in my case)? I hope it all goes well with your ophthalmologist appointment! Jan 08, 2019 5:42 AM. Are any of you also struggling with vision problems? When I was 27 I was blind as a bat for about a week. After that I had ON that would put puffy white-ish ""clouds"" into my field of vision if I was too hot. Unless I cooled down I would temporarily lose vision again. Fortunately, those issues disappeared after a couple of years. But with that said, in an attack/flare-up recently (decades later) I've had some more ON issues but not the white clouds (more of loss of stereo focus and blurriness). However, those seem to be declining in frequency and hopefully going away. Having read about you, two thoughts come to mind (more advice -- just what you need, right?!:). A few years ago I followed Terri Wahls' diet for over a year, a diet that calls for eating a profuse amounts of greens and veggies. At that time my vision was declining a bit, but pretty much like it does for lots of people in their late-40s/early-50s. But while on that diet my distance vision improved to better than 20/20. Today I'm a firm believer in eating greens and veggies. The other part is stress. There are lots of people that make links between MS issues and stress. Since your livelihood depends on it it's a tough issue, but if your job is a source of stress you might want to think about how you can reduce and deal with that issue. Jan 09, 2019 10:12 PM. Golgotha—yes, I’m soaking in alllll the advice i can get! It definitely feels much better to receive advice from people like you, who understand the personal struggle with MS! I’ve received more than enough advice from people who claim to “get it” when they don’t even struggle with the disability -_-. you know what, I think I will give more veggies a try! I’m personally horrible at it, but I can’t make excuses anymore. I truly appreciate your input! It’s very motivating to read the experiences of others and take in suggestions because I’ve been so lost and confused throughout this process Thank you!"

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694724168634464434/Can-Biotin-help-treat-MS?	"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system, including the brain and the spinal cord. Some studies suggest that a vital B-vitamin, biotin, might help reduce the impact of the disease. By Danielle Dresden - December 2018. Reviewed by Zara Risoldi Cochrane, PharmD, MS, FASCP. Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) use diet to help manage their symptoms. Many foods contain biotin , including brewer's yeast, nuts, egg yolks, Swiss chard, liver, and many others. One important group of vitamins are the B-vitamins, which help the body turn food into energy, support the nervous system, and maintain the skin, hair, eyes, and liver. They are vital during pregnancy. People sometimes refer to biotin as vitamin B-7 or vitamin H. It is one of the B-complex vitamins and is essential for human health. The United States Food and Nutrition Board has not set a recommended daily allowance (RDA) for biotin, but the board has established an adequate intake (AI) level of 30 micrograms (mcg) per day for adults. In this article, we look at the possible benefits of biotin in the treatment of MS. Amongst other foods, biotin can be found in nuts. Biotin is thought to help manage presentations of progressive MS due to supporting nerve cell metabolism. MS develops when the immune system targets and damages myelin, a substance that covers and protects the nerve cells. Biotin activates key enzymes, helping the body to produce more myelin. Enzymes are proteins that carry out crucial functions in the body. Healthy levels of myelin allow nerve cells to communicate with each other more efficiently. This communication between the nerve cells may reduce the level of disability in people with MS. Producing more myelin may also slow the progression of the disease. :::::::."																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295932945738032/MS-Views-and-News:	"December 27, 2018. The presence of certain levels of a molecule called acrolein in the human body could be an early warning sign for the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS), researchers say. Photo: iStock. New Delhi: The presence of certain levels of a molecule called acrolein in the human body could be an early warning sign for the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS), the incurable and often debilitating disease, researchers say. Researchers at Purdue University and the Indiana University School of Medicine in the US found that the molecule, previously suspected as a metabolic waste product that accumulates in people with certain neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease, could possibly be used to help diagnose MS. Acrolein is a byproduct of fat metabolism. A potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord, MS usually is diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, and affects twice as many women as men. Although there is no cure for MS, recent years have seen a flurry of activity around possible bio-markers and treatments. “We are in the process of trying to correlate acrolein levels with MS disease activity, which potentially would help us monitor disease activity with a blood test,” David Mattson, professor of neurology, and the director of the Indiana University Multiple Sclerosis Centre, said. “If this is validated, it would help us decide how aggressive to be with immunotherapy, or whether a therapy is working or there is a need to switch to a different therapy.”. Riyi Shi, a professor of neuroscience and biomedical engineering in Purdue University’s Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, has found that an accumulation of the molecule is present in animal models of neurological diseases such as MS, Parkinson’s disease, or even spinal cord and brain injuries. Acrolein is thought to damage cells by disrupting the lipids, or fats that protect nerve tissue, in a process called lipid peroxidation. Shi said that both blood and urine tests and assays have been able to measure acrolein levels in humans and in animal models. “The levels of this compound in urine and blood are correlated—the MS patients that had the highest level of acrolein in the blood also had the highest level in the urine,” he said. According to Shi, it is, therefore, possible that high level of acrolein is indicative of more active MS, although low levels do not rule out the possibility of someone having MS. Further research is needed to validate these initial observations. The research has suggested that acrolein is not just a potential bio-marker of MS, but could also be a target for therapies. “There are drugs already in the market that are known to be acrolein scavengers, and it is possible that one of these drugs could be re-purposed as a possible therapy for MS,” Shi said. “But these drugs also have strong effects on other targets, so more study would need to be done to see if they have a therapeutic effect to eliminate acrolein at a safe level.” According to the atlas of multiple sclerosis, there are about 2.3 million people in the world who suffer from the disease. It is estimated that the total burden in India is close to 180,000. :::::::."	"894,911"	2	patient

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295932945738032/MS-Views-and-News:	"Personal Takes. Compared with life with relapsing-remitting MS, SPMS feels like an entirely different environment. By Mona Sen. Accepting the changes that come with secondary-progressive MS is necessary to live well in this new place. The year was 2012 when I transitioned from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). At the time, however, I didn’t really know that I had entered a new phase of multiple sclerosis (MS) . In retrospect, yes, things were changing and had changed. But my MS moves like a slow train, and so the situation seemed manageable, though really it was not. I needed to realize that this new place was an entirely different environment from what I was used to. Sure, disability existed, and me within it, but now the disability and I were almost one and the same. Denial Is Not Always a Bad Thing. The way I see it, RRMS technically lasted from my diagnosis in 1986 until 2012. So the 26 formative years in between consisted of living life with the hope that things might never get bad. But they did: I followed the textbook on MS, meeting the milestones the experts said I would. Denial, as most of us know, is not always a negative thing, since I did live successfully during that time, trying to forget the entity within me. I just remember noticing odd symptoms and using a single cane to identify myself as a person with a disability. But that was then, and it was as though I was playing a part in a movie. I don’t recall feeling too much fear; it was just that I felt “different” and not quite myself. I talk about this in my memoir , because all I could do was write down my innermost feelings. Now, the next step is here, and I couldn’t really prepare for it. At Last: A Focus on People With Secondary-Progressive MS. Yesterday I realized why my neurologist likes seeing me twice a year. I’m sure he cares about how I’m managing, but since he is a clinician, one of his main aims is to watch for drastic changes in my symptoms or functioning, such as changes in my walking ability or use of adaptive equipment. Seeing my neurologist is almost a formality more than anything. He exists to cater to my changing needs since he cannot make bad symptoms go away. :::::::."

Wednesday January 02 2019 12:48 PM. Neurology Patients would welcome more information when they are diagnosed. A newly published report by the Neurological Alliance reveals that over half of patients surveyed reported they did not receive sufficient information at the time of diagnosis, including details of relevant patient support organisations. The findings come from the first ever patient experience survey of neurology services carried out by the Neurological Alliance. The survey examined a range of aspects of patient experience at their most recent appointment including waiting times, privacy, opportunity to ask questions and provision of information about medications, reasons for any treatment etc. Respondents were also asked about their diagnosis and how this was communicated at the time as well as their overall experience of neurology services. While a majority of service users were broadly satisfied with many aspects of their patient experience, there is a clear need to address information provision, especially at the time of diagnosis. Mags Rogers, Executive Director with the Neurological Alliance said "" If patients are telling us that they want more information we need to listen to this. While the small sample size and other limitations make it difficult to generalise from this research, it is an indication that further investigation is needed in order to understand and improve the experience of neurology patients at this most critical time in their lives"".

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4699981254098551968/Discussions---MS-Connection	"Dec 25, 2018 10:35 PM. An Open Letter of Thankfulness *. Hi Everyone- I’m Paula Brown and I’m new to this sight. In November, I released an Open Letter of Thankfulness revealing my diagnosis:. I am Judge Paula Brown and I serve you as an Appeals Court Judge on the Louisiana Court of. Appeal, Fourth Circuit. Many of you who know me, know that I am a breast cancer survivor—I was diagnosed in 2008 during my first run for judge of Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (I did not win that election). In 2009, during my second run for district court judge, I was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia (TN). TN, also known as “suicide disease,” is a chronic pain disorder affecting the trigeminal nerve that produces episodes of severe, sudden, sharp, shock-like excruciating pain on one side of the face. There is, arguably, no worse pain than the pain of TN. In early 2010, I won my election for and was seated as a district court judge of Civil District Court; I lost my mother not long afterwards; and later that year, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). Some may ask why am I writing this open letter—quite frankly, I was compelled to write it! I write to bring awareness to TN and MS, diseases of which many may suffer from in silence, like I did; and I write in hopes that my testimony might be a blessing and serve as encouragement to someone else suffering from these diseases. Because I truly believe, “For unto whomever much is given, of him shall be much required.” (Luke 12:48 KJV). Despite my diagnoses, I am filled with a tremendous amount of faith, gratitude and thankfulness.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531972474508957/Discussions---MS-Connection	"Dec 25, 2018 10:12 PM. Symptom or no??*. Hey everyone,. I have some issues and was wondering if they were related to the disease or not. I can't find information for this anywhere. Since the onset of my struggle with MS, I have seen a drastic decline in my sexual desire whenever I have a relapse. I know that this is a symptom of MS. But for me it goes further than that. I don't want to be touched at all. I don't want to be kissed. Nor do I want to give hugs or kisses or even have my back rubbed by my husband. This is causing a lot of strain on my marriage. Is this related to the disease or is this something else entirely? My husband doesn't think the two are related and keeps asking me if I want a divorce. I'm getting so frustrated because I don't want tto be touched ever and he will kiss me or try to hug me or ask me to cuddle with him and it makes me insane with anger. Am I just completely crazy or is this normal for others with MS? I'm new to all of this and I don't know a single soul who has it. He feels like I don't love him anymore and I feel like he's disrespecting me by constantly asking me to do anything with him, even kiss him. I love my husband. I'm very much attracted to him. But just the thought of even being kissed or touched by anybody makes me sick. The thought of anything sexual makes me cringe to no end. Please help!! Dec 25, 2018 11:38 PM. hello crystal, first might i suggest you sit and write you husband a love letter, letting him know how much you care for him and how awful your body feels, tell the truth and it will shine through the page. Talk with him about sex. Communication is the only thing that works. Let him know how your body feels. And what you have to do for you is scan your body from head to toe, notice any tightness in the muscles, spasms are things that numb the nerves, the muscles become so tight they have deadened the nerves to the tightness. When we have an exacerbation or whatever you choose to call it, it is an episode that effects the entire body, every nerve is fired up to do something and it does anything and everything. We walk into walls, drop things, fall, slur speech, forget, get confused, get disoriented all of the above all at once, all the wiring in our bodies gets tied up in knots, and the more episodes we have closer together the tighter the knots get and the more twisted the wiring, and we look fine, and we look at ourselves in the mirror and see nothing abby normal! So we think we are fine even though we feel lousy. Spend some time using your fingertips touching your arms, legs, face etc, describe to yourself what it feels like, hot cold, stiff soft, pain. If it is pain, figuring out the why is important, spasm? You can also ask your husband to put his hand on your arm, very gently, softly and tell him what it feels like, and you do the same for him, put your hand on him and tell him what you feel. If you want your marriage to flourish talk, talk and talk some more. This is a journey you are sharing and the more he understands the more you both will grow - together. He has no idea what you are going through and unless you share with him, he will imagine whatever his imagination can come up with. Painful sex is a bummer feeling unloved is worse. Dec 26, 2018 11:31 AM. Hi crystalstill,. Thank you so much for posting this- some of these symptoms are the most difficult to contend with, and so rarely discussed openly.

It’s really bugging me though about my future still even tho 14-15 months after dx I am relapse free and stable with minimal sx from dx flare. MS has wiped out my livelihood, broke up with a 6 year relationship and single now and have no one by my side any longer. I have a large credit debt to manage and struggling to find a job (I’m trying) my part time gig barely keeps the wolves at the door... thankfully I’m living with my parents but they are aging... dads an alcoholic and mom has cancer and is declining.

The retrospective study, “ Multiple sclerosis risk factors contribute to onset heterogeneity ,” was published in the journal Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders . MS, a neurodegenerative and autoimmune disease, is associated with both genetic and environmental risk factors. Although both have been thoroughly investigated, the “processes contributing to heterogeneity in the clinical manifestation of the disease remain unclear,” the researchers wrote. Multiple studies show that each patient’s characteristics at disease onset — such as age, number of impaired functional domains (NIFDs; functions ranging from walking and balance, to problems with vision, fatigue, or limb numbness or pain), time to second relapse (TT2R), and early relapse activity (ERA) — can help to predict MS activity and progression. But factors are also likely to play a role in early disease presentation. To pinpoint the mechanisms involved in disease variability and progression, researchers at Case Western Reserve University investigated the influence of those factors with known links to early disease presentation. Their study analyzed data on 1,515 people in the Accelerated Cure Project Repository , an open-access resource containing clinical records from a U.S. population of MS patients. Machine learning and mathematical models were used to assess the relevance of each measure for each disease outcome. :::::::."

Treatment with Ampyra ( dalfampridine ) for 24 weeks leads to sustained and clinically meaningful improvements in walking ability as reported by multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with gait difficulties, according to a study analyzing results from a Phase 3 trial. The study, “ Assessment of Clinically Meaningful Improvements in Self-Reported Walking Ability in Participants with Multiple Sclerosis: Results from the Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III ENHANCE Trial of Prolonged-Release Fampridine ” was published in the journal CNS Drugs . More than 90 percent of MS patients have difficulty walking, which reduces their independence and negatively affects their quality of life and productivity. Ampyra (prolonged-release dalfampridine tablets) is an approved MS medication marketed by Acorda Therapeutics in the U.S. It is the first therapy specifically approved to help improve walking in adults with MS. A generic version of #Ampyra was made available this year in the U.S. by Mylan . In Europe, the medicine is approved under the brand name Fampyra , being marketed by Biogen . An international group of researchers involved in the clinical trial ENHANCE — a large study evaluating Ampyra’s efficacy — conducted the present study to see whether the therapy could improve, in a clinically meaningful way, the walking ability of MS patients based on data from the trial. :::::::."																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4690172414479884077/What-prevents-remyelination?-New-stem-cell-research-reveals-a-critical-culprit	"What prevents remyelination? New stem cell research reveals a critical culprit. December 18, 2018,. Credit: CC0 Public Domain. New research on remyelination, the spontaneous regeneration of the brain's fatty insulator that keeps neurons communicating, could lead to a novel approach to developing treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) and other inflammatory diseases. The pre-clinical findings published today in Cell Reports by a University at Buffalo team reveal that activation of a specific transcription factor induces in adult stem cells a phenomenon called pathological quiescence. This is when adult stem cells are rendered incapable of responding to injury by producing myelin -forming oligodendrocytes. The failure to remyelinate is the key feature of MS. The paper defines the role of the previously undescribed transcription factor known as PRRX1 in human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, the cells that generate myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. Current MS research focuses largely on drugs that induce the differentiation of human oligodendrocyte progenitors. In contrast, the UB research presents a novel concept for the development of new drugs based on blocking the pathological quiescence of progenitors. ""The idea that pathological quiescence of progenitors could prevent regeneration in MS is distinct from the current pre-clinical strategies making their way into trial,"" explained Fraser Sim, Ph.D., senior author and associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB. ""We found that switching this gene on could cause problems in myelin repair by blocking the proliferation of the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell, the stem cell-like precursor that is responsible for all myelin regeneration in the adult brain,"" he said. The research demonstrated that PRRX1 expression results in the cell cycle arrest and quiescence of oligodendrocyte progenitors, which disabled the production of myelin. In an animal model of leukodystrophy, the group of genetic disorders in which myelin fails to form or is destroyed in children, Sim said that pathological quiescence induced by PRRX1 prevented cell colonization of white matter and effective myelin regeneration by transplanted human oligodendrocyte progenitors. They also found that blocking expression of this transcription factor prevented the negative effects of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-γ, which regulates its expression. ""We found that blockade of PRRX1 expression prevents the negative effects of interferon-γ, suggesting that PRRX1 expression might be a viable target in inflammatory diseases , such as multiple sclerosis, where interferon-γ may prevent successful myelin regeneration,"" said Sim. :::::::."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692885899639746753/Discussions---MS-Connection	"Dec 14, 2018 5:09 PM. Worried I may be experiencing early stage symptoms*. Hello all,. I am a 23 year old male who has a family history of MS. My dad was diagnosed with RRMS before I was born and my aunt (dad's half sister) was diagnosed with RRMS as well. My dad passed away in 2014 at the age of 59 due to COPD/MS complications because he never quit smoking. Tje las tcouple of years I have been experiencing body wide muscle twitching and more frequently now, painless muscle spasms. I've also felt a buzzing feeling in my right calf my chiro says might be due to poor posture and finger twitching in my thumbs and index fingers. Because of my family history it's become a daily fear that I'm going to be dx'd with MS. My PCP didnt seem too concerned as there arent any ""visible"" signs but referred me to a neuro for peace of mind. My app is on the 27th. If anyone could give me further info on if my symptoms sound like anything they experienced before being diagnosed/or if im just workng myself up for no reason I'd appreciate it. Also, what questions should i ask my neuro and what steps should be taken to properly investigate the cause of my symptoms? Dec 15, 2018 1:08 PM. ""Invisible symptoms"" can be the worst because so many people subscribe to the house of thought that ""You don't LOOK sick."" That being said, you have a valid reason to be concerned :there is a family history so these spasms can't necessarily be explained away with bad posture or stress. You are the one experiencing these symptoms, not anyone else, so if you know what your body usually feels like and these symptoms are so NOT NORMAL, stand your ground and get your answers. Ask the neuro anything you want, but remember to tell him, or her, the story that led you to their office in the first place. As to symptoms leading up to a diagnosis, for me I had symptoms off and on for a decade (even though I didn't realize it) before I was formally diagnosed. MS affects everybody differently. I first had a loss of leg strength on the job, then nothing for about 6 years when I had another collapse; both were signed off as stress. Finally I had another collapse and had been living with numbed feet for a year. I ended up going to the e.r., got sent to another hospital that specialized in neurology, and boom: I got the answer of MS. Whatever it ends up being, don't be scared. The treatments for MS, if that is truly what it is, can enable you to live with this disease rather well. I wish you luck and hope things work out well for you. Just remember: when the going gets rough, don't forget the chocolate. Dec 16, 2018 6:08 PM. RagnaRocker95, I am sorry for your loss. I have experienced all of the symptoms you describe at some point or another. I didn't experience body-wide muscle twitching but I have had instances when my thumbs or facial muscles twitch. The muscle spasms have happened to me a lot, mostly in my legs, arms and feet. The ""buzzing feeling"" I get in my thighs especially my right thigh for some reason. Once I thought it was my phone vibrating in my pocket but then realized my phone was on the desk. :-). I'm no doctor but I doubt bad posture would cause all of these symptoms; it's absurd your Chiropractor would chalk it up as such. My PCP also didn't believe me even when I told her just a handfull off the list of all the symptoms I had experienced. When I got back from being at the hospital 5 days receivng treatment and told her about it, she looked up the medical records and then said, ""Wow they did a number on you"". Of course she saw and read the results which confirmed it is MS. That same visit she called the only neurologist in this area whom I had managed to schedule an appointment with but they could not fit me in until a month and a half out. When she told them that I have MS they then made my appointment within a week. My PCP saw the error in her ways and tried to make it up by getting me a referral; to a physical therapist. She also gave me a prescription to get a shower chair, cain, and walker. Your neurologist should have you get an MRI. MRIs are better imaging than CT scans as CT scans miss things the MRI picks up. They may also do a spinal tap and bloodwork to rule out any other possible diseases. If it does come out that you have MS, I would ask your neuro whether you have RRMS or PPMS. Then I advise you to do some research on the different Disease Modifying Treatments out there. It is best that you be informed about the different side-effects each treatment can cause so you can pick one that you think you can handle if it does give you those side-effects. If you are not informed and don't know about the DMTs, your neuro will just pick one for you. The best advice I'm going to provide you is...to be your own advocate. You know yourself better than any doctor, family member, or anyone else. Fight for yourself because if you don't, no one else will do it for you. If they do try to 'help' you, they will push things on you THEY think is best for you but may not be good for you at all. In conclusion self-advocate, research, stay informed, and take care of yourself. Good luck and know we are all still here for you regardless what happens. Dec 17, 2018 8:49 AM. Hi there,. These are some links to information on the Society's website that I thought might be relevant to your questions:. Make the Most of Your Doctor Visits. Preparing for MS Doctor Visits Telelearning (Recording). Diagnosing Tools - it may help to become familiar with the tools used to diagnose MS, to understand what the neurologist is looking for and what criteria needs to be met to make a diagnosis of MS. I hope your appointment on the 27th goes well. Please let us know how you are doing and if you have further questions. Dec 17, 2018 5:01 PM. Hi, it's the ""invisible symptoms"" that affect an upending number of PCP, who just don't get it. I went to all sorts of doctors over the years. I knew even in my 20s that there was something wrong with me because I had episodes where my legs felt like they were encased in cement or ice blocks. It was very frustrating when my first husband was always telling me to hurry up and I couldn't. And I was only in my 20s the best years of people's lives. Over the decades, I went to all sorts of doctors. It was not until I was 61 years old that they finally were able to correctly diagnosis me. My new neurologist suspected something and had me have a MRI done. I was in shock when he showed me the images of my brain and neck. Never, never had I suspected something as horrible as that. I called my last surviving aunt and it turns out that we had MS in our family and some of my cousins were in wheelchairs. I can't believe my mother never told me. Good luck on December 27 with your appointment and please get back in touch with us."

"medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295900312447043/Oligodendrocytes,-Cells-That-Produce-Myelin,-Can-Be-Generated-from-Astrocytes,-Study-Reports"	"BY JOSE MARQUES LOPES, PHD. A molecule known as Sox10 enables brain cells called astrocytes to convert into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, a new study in mice reports. The findings suggest an approach for myelin repair in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and similar disorders, its researchers said. The study, “ In vivo conversion of astrocytes into oligodendrocyte lineage cells with transcription factor Sox10; Promise for myelin repair in multiple sclerosis ,” was published in the journal PLOS ONE . Given the key role of oligodendrocyte pathology in MS, replacing these myelin-producing cells would be a promising therapeutic approach, particularly if autologous (of the same individual) sources of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) can be used. Astrocytes – a cell involved in the formation of the blood-brain barrier and in response to injury – are the major component of glial scars, which develop after neural cell loss caused by degenerative diseases and traumatic injuries. Prior research has shown that astrocytes may be converted into neurons (nerve cells) and stem-like cells in vitro by forcing the production of transcription factors, or molecules that control gene activity. As a result, changing astrocytes into progenitor cells has been attempted in vivo — inside a living organism — to enable tissue repair. Both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are types of glial cells. Astrocytes have been converted into myelinating cells with a micro RNA – tiny RNA molecules that also regulate gene activity – and a transcription factor not specific to oligodendrocytes. This inspired a research team at the Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology in Iran and the University of California, Davis , to look for a transcription factor specific to oligodendrocytes that also showed an ability to change astrocytes into OPCs in vivo . :::::::."																																																																																							
"medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4685225693897070088/Hospital-Charges-123,000-for-Two-MS-Treatments"	"By Jay Hancock, Kaiser Health News. Nov. 28, 2018 -- Shereese Hickson’s multiple sclerosis was flaring again. Spasms in her legs and other symptoms were getting worse. She could still walk and take care of her son six years after doctors diagnosed the disease, which attacks the central nervous system. Earlier symptoms such as slurred speech and vision problems had resolved with treatment, but others lingered: she was tired and sometimes still fell. This summer, a doctor switched her to Ocrevus, a drug approved in 2017 that delayed progression of the disease in clinical trials better than an older medicine did. Genentech, a South San Francisco-based subsidiary of Swiss pharma giant Roche, makes Ocrevus. It is one of several drugs for multiple sclerosis delivered intravenously in a hospital or clinic. Such medicines have become increasingly expensive as a group, priced in many cases at well over $80,000 a year. Hospitals delivering the drugs often take a cut by upcharging the drug or adding hefty fees for the infusion clinic. Hickson received her first two Ocrevus infusions as an outpatient two weeks apart in July and August. And then the bill came. Patient: Shereese Hickson, 39, single mother who worked as a health aide and trained as a medical coder, living in Girard, Ohio. Because her MS has left her too disabled to work, she is now on Medicare; she also has Medicaid for backup. Total Bill: $123,019 for two Ocrevus infusions taken as an outpatient. CareSource, Hickson’s Medicare managed-care plan, paid a discounted $28,960. Hickson got a bill for about $3,620, the balance calculated as her share by the hospital after the insurance reimbursement. :::::::. To receive MS news and information via e-mail, Please."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692886081097572315/MS-Ireland--::-Helping-Everyone-Affected-by-Multiple-Sclerosis	"MS Ireland  ::. Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Inclusion Is For Everybody. Monday December 03 2018 08:00 AM. This week Grace Kavanagh writes about what the International Day of People With Disabilities means to her and what we as individuals understand about living with a disability. I’ll forgive you if you weren’t aware that there was such a thing as International Day of People With Disabilities . I wasn’t either before some research. It is an initiative set up by the UN in 1992 to promote understanding of disability issues and to raise support for those with disabilities to enable them to participate equally in society. It is held yearly on December 3rd and the theme for this year is “Inclusion is for everybody” . The day is recognised at the UN headquarters in New York with organisations and groups around the world encouraged to hold their own events. I love the idea of social equality but think in reality we have a long way to go. Raising awareness is one thing but raising understanding and empathy is quite another and this is where I think the focus should be. So what do I as a person with disability think the International Day of People With Disabilities should include? I don’t think any one person can understand all the challenges people with differing disabilities face and I certainly can’t speak for everyone. I do however think that we all need to think a bit more about other people and try not to be entirely caught up in our own worlds. We have all been guilty of unknowingly causing issues for others by our actions so here are some things to consider in our everyday lives that might have an impact on people with disabilities. ● Viewing things from the perspective of the person with a disability would help us all to see how our actions can impede others. It could also help us to be less irritated or frustrated when we understand the challenges the other person is facing. ● Experiences that give an insight into the life of someone with a disability can really boost understanding. For example the MSunderstood cafe gives people the opportunity to view the world from the perspective of someone living with MS. I’ll be sending my husband when it comes back to Dublin! ● In a similar way, I know of a charity for the visually impaired that requires employees to spend time wearing glasses that distort vision and use a wheelchair so they understand the difficulties people they work with may have. ● I taught computing to a lady with hearing difficulties. She had a sign language interpreter who enabled her to be an equal participant in the class. I learnt to address my comments to her and not her interpreter, just as I would with any other member of the class. ● Think before you park your car! Parking on pavements or up on the kerb leaves no safe route for people in wheelchairs, while parking in disabled bays when you don’t need to means a person with a disability can’t use the facility. ● Don’t get me started on the pavements in Dublin! They are a hazard to everyone but in particular those with mobility issues. Try not to add to the problem by leaving obstructions like bins on the path. Disabilities aren’t always visible. You don’t know what someone else is coping with just by looking at them. They could be living with chronic pain but look fine. Try not to judge what you don’t know.

BUT take a breathe please and think this through. I know, can tell that you are and only want whats best for those around you. That your trying to something that is completely unselfish. However while trying to do a unselfish thing, you are being very selfish. I don't believe for a second that you know you are being selfish. Its just you trying to look out for others in what you see as a death sentence. This disease isn't a death sentence!!! Yes bad and not fun stuff CAN happen BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL HAPPEN. In this fun thing we call MS you can run the gamete of 100% fine to 100% ""broken"". I've been married 19 yrs and have thought similar to you. Being with someone for 18yrs is a marriage. Just because you don't have paper doesn't mean that your not married! To take away his right to stay or go.... that is selfish on your part IMO. Its different then the mom problem, your BF loves you and wants you, good, bad, ugly. I'm sorry your having such a hard time right now. I recall how it felt when I was 1st DX. You can't fight this alone and need support. From the sounds of it you have that with your BF and friends. So you may have to find a new ""normal"" for your ""fun, dating"" part of life with your BF. So ACCEPT the CHALLENGE and FIGHT! You will the spend rest of your life fighting at time for most things in life. DO NOT LET THIS DISEASE WIN AND TAKE YOUR LOVE FROM YOUR LIFE!!!! Who told you this disease was a life sentence? I genuinely would like to know? Did your doctor tell you to break up? If yes what kind of doc was it? General Dr? Do they know your BF and you have together for 18yrs? Again that's a marriage and are you saying someone like myself should leave my hubby? I was given a walker just a few months into my dx and only used it for a month or so. I was taken off of work months after my DX and told to apply for disability. I was awarded it in record time with zero fight. I was given a dx in 3 days! All of these things tell me...my MRI are for To look at me you wouldn't know I pee my pants sometimes. That my hands don't work enough for me to make cakes anymore w/out help. You don't look at me and see my walking stick I ALWAYS have in my van. Or see that my right eye has caused me A LOT of problems. Ppl don't see that I'm ALWAYS in pain or that I can't run anymore, deal with heat or cold, eat out with out feeling like crap after due to stuff added into the food. What's my point? YOU ARE OK!!! You HAVE to find a new normal or all you do is see the darkness and not any of the bright love around you!!! I don't believe in god just like you. I deal with my dad who is like your mom but taking what his says and just thinking ""hey doesn't hurt for him to pray for a cure. Doesn't hurt for him to pray for me and make himself feel better."" None of that hurts me. It all makes him feel better and thats ok. Your BF is the same way!!! What if he didn't take you up on the offer to leave because he wants to stay?!?!?! 🤯🤯🤯 What if doesn't see you as broken and damaged like you see yourself now or in the future? Yo. see only the dark BUT WHAT IF ONLY YOU SEE THAT??? Wh. t if nobody else see's you as damaged goods? Or. what if where you see caretaker they see a spouse that WANTS to WALK THROUGH LIFE WITH YOU!

Some drugs must be weaned very slowly, if your medication dosage is abruptly changed it could be causing a severe reaction. If the side effects of the drug are causing you to change the dosage on your own please discuss it with the doc, you may have a choice of another drug for ms. I can not stress enough the caution about learning how to stop a drug you are on or to change a dosage without knowledge. When betaseron was no longer working for me the doc said stop it, and I had a month of all the symptoms of ms hitting me at once, cold turkey was the wrong way to go, it should have been tapered. And when I called the company they had no information about what happens to a patient when they stop taking the betaseron! Think about the fact that you are putting something into your body and the body over time adapts to the change, then when you alter the routine the body must react especially if it is a dramatic shock therapy like we get, Remember when you first started it and what your body went through, you are doing that over and over again when you alter the routine."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695380557731626506/Fever-Fatale---MS-Connection	"“A fever could be life threatening.”. That single line from an old episode of “The West Wing” prompted me to immediately Google whether, in fact, a fever is fatal to someone with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, something with which I was diagnosed in the summer of 2014. Fresh from learning I had MS, this mere suggestion plunged me into a panic. A search of “fever and multiple sclerosis” yielded over 590,000 results. The first couple of articles I found told me patients who had low-grade fevers suffered more from chronic fatigue than others and that MS patients experience an exacerbation of symptoms when they’re overheated, whether from weather or internally high temps. ""But what about this life threatening business?"" I muttered to myself as I sat at my desk, freaking out over whether what I’d heard on the classic TV show was indeed true. Could a fever prove fatal, as the fictional first lady said in the drama about a president who had relapsing remitting MS? I kept digging. I inputted “fever and multiple sclerosis and west wing” in the search box. One of the pieces I found explored whether the show’s Jed Bartlet character accurately represented the real-life experiences of MS patients. While noting that the National Multiple Sclerosis Society had bestowed an award to the program for raising awareness about MS, it only briefly mentioned the fever issue, which became a major plot point after President Bartlet, who was suffering an MS flare-up, passed out in the Oval Office. His wife Abbey tearfully admitted it wasn’t the flu that was making him ill. “I see you trying to cover the panic,” the chief of staff told the first lady, imploring her to reveal what was really going on. “He has multiple sclerosis, Leo,” Abbey Bartlet said in a near-whisper. “... A fever could be life threatening.”. A newbie to all things MS, I was voraciously devouring every new piece of information about MS. This made me hyper-aware of any pop culture and news media references to the disease because MS was no longer a hypothetical or an abstract. Not too long after I learned I had MS, I started streaming the first season of “The West Wing” on my laptop and made a realization: Jed Bartlet has MS too. I vaguely remembered that from when I watched it during its original run many years ago, but the MS storyline hadn’t emotionally registered with me then. Now it did. While I searched for a nugget of truth in that fatal fever line, I came across a mention of a newspaper article quoting the then-president of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society who said, “A fever is no more deadly for people with MS than it is for the general population.”. But those petrifying pop culture MS references kept on coming and, as I was still adjusting to my post-diagnosis life, they proved jarring. There was the father in the movie “Trainwreck” who at one point couldn’t handle his MS symptoms any longer. There was the Showtime drama about the impact of an affair on two marriages, aptly named “The Affair,” whose lead character spent his teen years caring for his mother as her MS symptoms worsened, eventually leading to son-assisted suicide. After the first MS mention in The Affair, I took to Google again. As I was typing “Is MS,” the search engine auto-filled “fatal” for me. This wasn’t helpful for a nervous patient. Another TV drama, “Elementary,” decided to give MS to the girlfriend of a regular character. She promptly broke up with her police captain beau because she didn’t want her MS to become a “burden” to him. Confused, the police captain sought advice from a physician friend who warned of bleak times ahead. “MS is cruel,” the doctor character said. “The progression is gonna be tough on her, and you. It could take years or months, and once the disease really takes hold, she’s gonna need a lot of help.”. Yes, raising awareness of multiple sclerosis is a noble and necessary thing. But frightening MS patients, particularly recently-diagnosed ones, is quite another. Four years into this MS experience, my antennae remain highly sensitive to pop culture MS references (there was even one on “ This Is Us” last season that surprised me). But nowadays, I’m not nearly as reactive or as fearful as I used to be. All that research -- in addition to regularly peppering my neurologist with questions -- has enabled me to more deftly and confidently handle any new pop culture MS references, no matter how dire. Abbey Bartlet doesn’t scare me anymore."	"2817,2823"	1	patient	"3071,3077"	1	patient	"3045,3055"	2

Yes, 148 is higher than you want. Honey can do that, but to understand this better, you would have to test yourself before you drink the tea with honey and then about two hours later. That would show you how much your blood sugar rose. It would also show you what your fasting blood sugar was (from overnight before you eat or drink anything but water). Many things can affect our blood sugar readings: food and drink, some medications, stress and illness, heredity. If there are any family members with diabetes, this would be an alert to you to watch your blood sugar. I hope that your doctor includes blood sugar tests in your annual exams. If there are results that are anywhere over 100, you and the doctor would need to be more vigilant and test more often and having a meter at home is a good choice. Sometimes if we eat late at night and have a lot of carbohydrates like potatoes or bread (any food made with flour like pasta or crackers or food made with sugar), we will find that our morning fasting numbers are high. This 'might' even happen with someone who does not have blood sugar problems. In any case, since you have a meter, I think you should keep a record of your blood sugar with times, results and what you ate and drank. You would test before eating or drinking something, write the result down with the time, then write down what you eat or drink, then test about two hours later. Don't freak out or get upset. At this point, I think you can bring your readings lower just by adjusting what you're eating. And, as I wrote above, medications can also affect blood sugar. Do you take any? Do you have any family members with diabetes? I'm glad you wrote so you can understand what's happening better! diabetes type 2 controlled by diet and exercise and. very low carb way of eating. Check out the following site for more info on blood sugar:. Posted 11/12/2018 8:30 AM (GMT -7). Thanks for the reply. I don't think there are any family members with Diabetes. Not sure, but don't think so. I have been under enormous stress for a couple years. My husband passed away in June this year and we scattered his ashes just last Saturday. So I suspect all the crying and anxiety is affecting me in a lot of ways. I do eat crackers at night. Have done this for a long time. Need to find a different snack I guess. Yesterday I took a Librax for stomach issues. Most meds stay in my system for a long time and cause some dizziness. The MS has been blamed for almost everything over the years, but I often have my doubts. I tend to overthink everything. I don't eat regular meals. I eat when I can or when I feel hungry. Sometimes I pick all day long. So I'm not sure when to test. I went thru all this with my husband. He was frequently low in the morning and had terrible symptoms. When his b/s was high he didn't seem to have any symptoms. Very confusing disease. I also went back and checked my lab records for a couple years. The Glucose was always normal... even last summer. Thank you for the help. Post Edited (ozarker) : 11/12/2018 8:58:22 AM (GMT-7). Posted 11/12/2018 10:21 AM (GMT -7). I'm sorry for the loss of your husband. I'm sure you were going through a lot of stress (and probably still are). I hope you have been doing better lately and have some good support from family and your doctors. For your blood sugar, as I wrote, a journal is best so you can see what's going on. And this is something you can show your doctor if necessary, too. Since you are ""grazing"" rather than eating an entire meal at one time, just take your blood sugar and write the time and results. Then, eat something that you normally would at that time, and then test about 2 hours later, even 1 1/2 hours later and write the results down. The difference in readings will tell you how you metabolized what you ate or drank. Also, take your blood sugar as soon as you wake up before you eat or drink anything. Fasting blood sugar does tell you and the doctor a lot about your blood sugar health. Then, don't stress about this. If you don't have anyone in the family with diabetes (maybe this is something you need to ask about , too), then this is good news because very very often, blood sugar problems run in the family. If you are overweight, this also contributes to higher blood sugar the same as not being active physically. As we get older (I know this because I'm 69.) we are often less active for various reasons, so if this is the case, it also contributes to higher blood sugar. You can read the stickies at the top of the Diabetes Forum and the link in my signature for more information. As for the Librax, it might be why you have some dizziness. If this is more than just passing, please speak to your doctor or the pharmacist. There might be some ways to change it or how you take it. Here is a link that explains this medication: https://www.rxlist.com/librax-side-effects-drug-center.htm#overview. I'm glad you posted! Where are you in the Ozarks? I'm outside of Memphis. Posted 11/12/2018 10:54 AM (GMT -7). Thanks again. I am about 100 lbs, 68 years old. The MS does bring on constant dizziness and fatigue. So my neuro has been watching this for years. But, sometimes I just want to dig around and find an answer myself. I'm not very active either. Have a lot of pain at times and am too exhausted to do much. I do try to walk around, from one end of the house to the other a lot. You are right about the stress. I took care of Sam for a couple years, then it gradually became more and more difficult. I was sick, and he was progressing to the point where he needed more help. The last 2 months we had Hospice, then a caregiver, then he was gone. I watched him take his last breath in our home. I'm having a terrible time with this. My kids are good to help me when they can. It was a terrible thing to endure. I am in Marshfield Mo. Near Springfield. And I have been to Memphis. Getting snow right now.. first time this year. Getting ready to go test. I hope I'm doing this right. I did it for Sam many times, but this is a new unit... a cheap one... Diagnosed with MS 2001. Posted 11/12/2018 11:00 AM (GMT -7). Now I can go eat something. Earlier I had peanut butter on bread and tea with honey. My meter registers the readings. Posted 11/12/2018 1:10 PM (GMT -7). By the way... what is the 2 hour delay between eating and testing all about ? Does it take 2 hours to digest food? Posted 11/12/2018 1:40 PM (GMT -7). No, it's not about digestion. I think it's compared to the 'normal' time that non-diabetics can metabolize food/drink. It's basically comparing how our results are in relation to a non-diabetic's. I think digestion actually begins in the mouth when the saliva mixes with the food (if I remember my high school science class correctly). Some food affects our blood sugar way more than others. Anything made with flour or sugar (or honey, maple syrup...), rice, grains like corn, potatoes, beans will make our blood sugar rise fast and high, but something like a piece of steak or chicken or fish will not. So, these guidelines that we're given by the doctors are really telling us what level we should be at and what level we shouldn't be at. All this is compared to people who don't have diabetes. But it's not that simple. Having the elevated reading you had before would mean you don't metabolize the carbs in food and drink as a non-diabetic would. A non-diabetic's blood sugar would rarely spike that high. Another thing that doctors look at is how long it takes for our blood sugar to come back down to normal after eating. The longer it takes, the more problems the doctor sees for our blood sugar ""recovery"". Your 115 after eating the peanut butter on bread and having tea with honey shows that you didn't spike very high as you did before. Peanut butter (the natural kind, not the kind with added sugar) is great to eat and snack on. And of course the bread is a carb but some factors may determine how many carbs are in that bread: how big the slice is, the ingredients of the bread, how many slices you eat. Honey is pure sugar. I think being aware of this is good but not obsessive. If it makes you eat more vegetables, then this is a good thing! Colorful vegetables like different bell peppers, leafy greens, mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, cauliflower, eggplant, zucchini, radishes, green beans are all nutritious and filling and better for our blood sugar than potatoes. Posted 11/12/2018 3:03 PM (GMT -7). So after all this do you think I have Diabetes? I really don't think so, but I do have a bunch of other problems gumming up the works. I will see my primary about this and get things checked. Sorry to sound so stupid but I really never learned much about nutrition and don't know anything about metabolizing. I always thought honey was good for us. I've had tea with honey for a few years now. I honestly hope I don't have to start learning all about this now. My husband took care of his own insulin etc until the last weeks of his life. By then, Hospice took him off all meds anyway. Posted 11/12/2018 6:44 PM (GMT -7). ""Metabolizing"" means how our bodies process our food, how it breaks it down into useful nutrients and uses them and how our bodies create waste from the food we eat. So when we eat a meal, our bodies break down the food into what's useful for us and what's not. To get a lot of natural vitamins and minerals, we need to eat lots of fresh (or even frozen) vegetables. Fruit has the same nutrients as vegetables but it also has fructose, a sugar that makes most fruit sweet. The best you can do for yourself is keep a journal of your blood sugar as I described and the next time you see your doctor, show it to him or her. And check out the link in my signature if you want to do some reading about blood sugar. But please don't stress yourself out over this. You've been through a lot both emotionally and physically to this point and worrying will make you feel worse. I suggest you eat wholesome, fresh food to keep yourself healthy in the meantime. I hope the weather isn't too bad in Marshfield. We're in the low 40's here and looking at the 20's and 30's overnight. Posted 11/13/2018 7:07 AM (GMT -7). Thank you so much. I tested first thing this morning, before even getting out of bed. 93 score. We got our first snow yesterday. It's down in the teens with a wind chill of 4 degrees. But I don't mind the cold so much. It's the ice I hate!! I've fallen off the road too many times on black ice. So now I don't even attempt to go out. I've been reading a lot about blood sugar. Our bodies are so complicated. I knew a little about this with Sam, but really he took care of it himself until the last few weeks of his life. By that time it wasn't necessary to even give insulin anymore. Yes, I've been thru a lot. I am crying as I type this. Everything turns on the tears, anytime, anywhere, any circumstance. I feel like I will never stop. 45 years together. Three kids together. One grandchild. We just scattered his ashes last Saturday... his request for the opening day of deer season. My poor son was beside himself. He took his Dad with him that morning for his last hunt... again, his request. Thanks for your patience and all your help. Posted 11/13/2018 9:22 AM (GMT -7). I'm sure this has been a hard road for you and I'm glad you have your kids to help you get through this - and don't forget that you're a great help for them, too! This kind of weather here brings ice more than snow and it's so much more dangerous for driving. It just seems they can't treat the roads here on time. Take care of yourself and your health. The best you can do for yourself is to learn as much as you can about what's going on. When you see your doctor and get any lab tests done, make sure you get copies of the lab results and keep them in a special file. Have a great day and post any questions that you have or if you need to talk!"

Every time that I went without steroids, my symptoms just continued to worsen. For me, I was often on a large 5-day dose, followed by a 12-day taper. Symptoms of my flare often didn't begin to improve until after the taper was over; it was hard to be patient. I have been in the same boat as you last time I had my Ivig infusion the Dr also gave me a dose of steroids one time and I was doing a little bit better the next day but everything came back again and it hasn't really improved much at all. Now when I'd be in the hospital for 3-4 days and got the steroids and a tapper pack I'd be ok anywhere from 2-3 months and better but not much. As to my health it's declined quite a bit more the last year I've gone way down hill as to the way I've been feeling. And yes I'm still looking for a maricle cure but I don't know if I'll ever find it.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4697268709650071775/HOW-MEDITATION-MAY-HELP	"Simple methods for staying relaxed. For many people, the word ""meditation"" calls up images of alternative lifestyles or non-Western traditions. However, public perception of meditation has started to shift in recent years due to the scientific community's growing interest in the topic. There’s still no conclusive proof that meditation makes a measurable, biochemical change in the body or the mind. But some psychologists have proposed that this form of relaxation may help people, including those with multiple sclerosis (MS), reach a calmer state of mind. And this could help reduce the impact of stress. Many paths to calm. There are many ways to meditate. Just keep an open mind and see which type of meditation works best for you. Before you begin a meditation session, talk to your doctor, select a quiet place, dress comfortably, and find a comfortable place to sit. Common meditation techniques include:. A practice of focusing exclusively on your breath. The goal of visualization is to shift your thoughts away from everyday concerns to an imaginary world of your own choosing. :::::::.

I would suggest that they read up on this disease or attend a MS group and bring along that person. I have tried getting my son to read up on this but I think he’s having a tuff time with this. I’m bringing my husband to a group meeting one of these times because he’s getting tired of listening to me. It’s only because he doesn’t understand. He and I are separated but still live together but he actually suggested that he will go. Bringing other family members or friends that you trust may also help. I honestly think this is better than reading. Hearing others going through the same thing may make them understand better and will hopefully make friends with other caregivers. This is my goal and hope this works. He’s really not a social butterfly but I’m hoping he will reach out as well to others for support. This is my suggestion. Good luck! Oct 29, 2018 11:26 AM.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695027060354592740/Changing-Your-Perception---MS-Connection	"A few weeks ago, I went to a class called “Forget Your Fear & Trust Your Truth – A Personal Growth Workshop” held at Happier Valley Comedy in Hadley, MA by Pam Victor, and it empowered me to unleash my potential and stop holding myself back. Three hours at this workshop learning improvisation fundamentals has changed my perspective on life and MS. When we first got to the class, we were asked to choose an intention card, and I chose one that said, “Take risks.” I was taking this class because I wanted to challenge myself and to live outside of the safety bubble I had created. After we all introduced ourselves and stated our intentions, we split up into pairs and played our first improvisation game called 1, 2, 3. All we had to do was take turns saying 1, 2 and 3 and if either one of us messed up at all, we both had to raise our arms in the air and shout, “Yay!”. It sounds simple to say 1, 2, and 3 over and over again between the two of us; however, there were several times where I and/or my partner would forget where we were in the sequence, and we would have to raise our arms high in the air and shout “Yay!”. Ultimately, what we learned from this exercise is that it’s OK to mess up and not be perfect. We actually had more fun when we messed up because we got to celebrate and become much more accepting of ourselves in that moment. Although at first we were scared to make a mistake, we quickly realized that being scared was a belief and not a fact, and that we had the power within us to change our definition of failure and the power it had over our thoughts and actions. As we got through this first exercise, I started to realize that my feelings of being alone, having no control and not fitting in were all in my head. They were just fears and not facts at all. Instead of focusing on myself, my mobility issues and how I was being perceived by the other people participating in the class, I stayed in the moment and tried to live in a judgement free zone. The results were amazing. For the first time in a long time, I felt free from my negative thoughts and knew that I could achieve anything that I set out to accomplish. Since that class, I have given my first motivational speech, and I have started blogging again. Don’t get me wrong, I still have self-doubts, negative thoughts and fears; however, they have lost a lot of their power, and I am able to acknowledge them and move in a positive direction. So many of our fears regarding MS are exacerbated by our own unhelpful thoughts and judgments. The only facts we know for sure about MS is that it is unpredictable, and it’s a “disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and body.” That being said, everything else is a belief because all of our stories are different. Whereas, I have mobility issues, I know of other people with MS who are out there running marathons. We are all challenged with different symptoms, even though we share the same disease; none the less, we should never feel alone, out of control, or like we don’t fit in. We are all special. We are all a work in progress. We weren’t meant to fit in; we were meant to stand out and connect with others through our stories."

You already know how this one is going to play out. Girl studies hard and gets a computer science place in Trinity College. Girl works her arse off and builds a nice little life for herself and her family. Girl is winning. Girl firmly believes that bad things happen to other people. She has plans, you see……. Mike Tyson nailed it when he said, “everyone has a plan ‘till they get punched in the mouth.” Next thing- girl is punch drunk and wondering how on earth she got into this position? More importantly, how was she going to get out of it? When the editorial team asked me what they wanted to write about this week, I must say that I felt a bit anxious. I still feel shame over having to throw in the towel and stop working in 2009. I didn’t get formally diagnosed until 2010 and until then, lived with the unsettling conviction that something was really, really, really, wrong with me. I HAD to stop working. End of story. It was destroying me every day. Not knowing what was destroying me made it even worse. People like explanations and I just did not have one to give. I didn’t realise how important having a job was to my standing in society. It’s one thing to stop working as a lifestyle decision – another entirely when you feel forced into it. People ask difficult questions. Social outings and meeting new people became awkward. I also felt terribly guilty about not having my own money. Actually, the story didn’t end there. After chasing a lot of dead ends, I retrained and now work 15 hours a week from home. I do my work in the mornings before cog-fog sets in. My business card says that I am the EUPATI Content Coordinator. I love my job and do not take it for granted for a second. I’m even happy to be back paying taxes! Long story short, it was not easy to get back into gainful employment, but it is possible. If one good thing has out of all I went through when I had to stop working, it’s that I learned more about compassion. Being kind is important (and that includes being kind to yourself). Don’t judge others when you are not standing in their shoes. If you feel that you are stuck in a situation through no fault of your own- seek help. I’m glad I went to Citizens Information to find out what my options were when I had to stop working. Dedicated to MS. Without whom this blog would not have been possible."

I can tell you I just purchased Dr. Wahl’s book. So far I’m reading The Wahl’s protocol. A radical way to treat chronic autoimmune conditions. So far this book is great. She also has books out on food. Also my brilliant daughter read this book by Paul Farmer..... Mountains beyond Mountains. He’s her idol. He goes into illnesses and did experiments with vitamins, food, placebos ect., too see if our intake of both helps our illnesses. Pretty heavy duty stuff. This guy is truly amazing. In short she got me on all natural nuts, fruit and vegetables. I’ve noticed a huge difference just in 2 weeks. Although she currently moved away, the reading materials are with her as well. Which brought me to Dr. Wahl’s. I hope this helps somewhat. I also know going gluten free is a big success. I hope you may post results once you find more answers. Oh and I wanted to add this. She told me changing my diet will take a good couple of months before I noticed anything due to getting rid of all the other toxins (to us) out of our systems before feeling results. Oct 22, 2018 10:34 AM. Genetics and a transient thyroid condition have made me particularly slender. Unhelpfully, my MS reduces my hunger and makes both task-switching and choosing difficult. My MS (and everything else) worsen if my eating habits don't included a habit of eating. I need to ignore any advice that includes avoiding any foods/only eating certain foods because the additional requirements make me less likely to eat at all. More than anything, what I need is calories. Fatigue is worse if you don't have fuel to burn. I try to have healthy, high-calorie food at hand. My fatigue increases if I go three days without meat, so I try not to go meatless for more than a day. I make no claims on what helps MS generally, but I know this is best for me, specifically. And now... now I need to go get something to eat. Nov 03, 2018 3:03 PM. Since I'm a fourth generation baker, I have quite the sweet tooth and passion for good breads. That being said, my gallbladder was removed several years ago so I had to choose a healthier way of living. Even though I haven't been following it religiously, The Mediterranean Diet concept seems to work for me. Big time fats: bye bye! Overly greasy foods: see ya! Fruits and veggies: can't get enough of them! Sweet stuff: one big sweet or junk food snack a day and call it good. I LOVE seafood and cooking and flavoring with olive oil, so that diet concept works for me and I maintain my blood sugar at work with fig bars, granola bars, a small stack of crackers (I keep some snacks in my locker), or by getting a cup of popcorn chicken from the deli. Overall, just doing things in moderation seems to work for me. I can't get enough of the ""rabbit food"" as my father-in-law puts it, but even too much of those will have you and the bathroom being REALLY good friends (LOL)."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4703875477179578555/MS-Ireland--::-Helping-Everyone-Affected-by-Multiple-Sclerosis	"MS Ireland  ::. Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. MS and The 2019 Budget. Monday October 08 2018 11:13 AM. Before Budget 2019, Helen Farrell shares her opinion on the financial challenges of living with MS and how the Irish State can truly support people. Our government ministers have an unenviable task in preparing our 2019 budget. Not only do they have to cover existing commitments but they also must plan for future contingencies and emergencies. Ireland has never been good at investing properly in the future and is bedevilled with transport, housing, education, social welfare and health systems that are full of historic quick-fixes and panicked responses to crises and outrages since the foundation of the State. Investing in proper preventative planning usually takes more resources and a longer-term view than ever seems achievable to our governments; to the despair of many. It’s understandable that buying the approval of voters and ensuring a positive next election is very important for political parties; few go into politics to be in opposition. Our elected representatives have a duty to balance the health, housing, education, welfare, transport and environmental needs of Irish citizens with the money they have available, and to enhance people’s lives, not necessarily their pockets. People with MS would love our politicians to sit up and notice that our neurological services are woefully underfunded and do not compare at all favourably with the rest of Europe, or indeed globally. MS is something that arrives in our lives uninvited and makes itself at home for life, often damaging our earning potential and costing us in so many ways across our lifespan. With access to good healthcare, medication, rehabilitation and support, life can continue for many of us in a productive way (albeit changed) but only if we receive the proper support. It is false economy to stint on these supports. The more support we have when living with MS, the more we can continue to remain engaged with life, earning and contributing financially and in voluntary ways and putting less of a financial burden on the State. It makes good financial sense to invest in MSer’s and conversely very poor judgement to limit services and supports. A severe MS-relapse or disease-course is far costlier for our healthcare, social welfare and other systems to deal with than the optimal situation of keeping a person with MS as healthy as they can be. At a personal level I am still angry at the election promise reneged on in 2013, to give all people who hold the Long-Term Illness Card an automatic GP Visit Card . It would have made life much easier for us all with MS. Keep us well and we’ll be more productive, for longer. MS Ireland’s pre-budget submission makes for sober reading ( read here ). The key asks of MS Ireland for Budget 2019 involve proper investment in neurology services, neurorehabilitation, community services and housing adaptation, as well as automatic entitlement to a GP Visit Card. Although our Social Welfare services can provide good support for those of us who can’t work full-time or at all, more needs to be done to “make work pay”, although I personally dislike that phrase. There’s a whiff of the opinion that people who access Social Welfare are choosing not to work when they weigh up the financial “benefits” in favour of a life of State support. Nothing could be further from the truth for most of us. We are trying to hang on with grim determination of any remnant of our former pre-MS working lives, reinventing ourselves, constantly adjusting and trying to outwit this disease. Another area that MS Ireland would like addressed is the amount of income disregarded when applying for Medical Cards. In people with MS on lower incomes, the disregard should be far higher, due to identified higher costs of living with MS. It is an exciting time in terms of new treatments emerging for MS. There have been quite a few new disease-modifying medications licensed in recent years that provide greater efficacy against MS, and the promise of more to come. New and innovative medications cost money and the government need to ring-fence spending to cover this for the future. All in all, a lot for our government to consider. But short-term planning benefit nobody and makes no prudential sense in the long-run. What we need now is our government to focus on playing the long game; just like MS does with us.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295887488397983/Spasticity-and-MS:-How-to-Control-Your-Muscles	"Many people with multiple sclerosis have stiff muscles and spasms, a condition called spasticity. It happens mostly in the muscles of the legs and arms, and it may keep you from moving your limbs freely. You might feel spasticity either as stiffness that doesn't go away or as movements you can't control that come and go, especially at night. It can feel like a muscle tightening, or it can be very painful. Spasticity also can make you ache or feel tight in and around your joints and low back. How you feel can vary depending on your position, posture, and how relaxed you are. What Causes Spasticity? Spasticity happens because of an imbalance in the electrical signals coming from the brain and spinal cord, often when multiple sclerosis has damaged the nerves there. This unevenness makes your muscles contract on their own and makes them tense. :::::::. "

The research team will be live at the world’s largest conference in Berlin, Germany next week - Blog - MS Society of Canada. The MS Society of Canada’s research team is preparing to fly over the Atlantic to the exciting city of Berlin, Germany to attend the 34 th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) from October 10-12, 2018. With thousands of participants from all over the world attending, the conference is bound to provide the latest information on research on multiple sclerosis (MS). Topics at this year’s meeting include pediatric MS, clinical trial in MS, immunology, neurodegeneration, novel technologies and treatment monitoring, just to name a few. Selected abstracts will be presented throughout the week at poster sessions (researchers showcase their data on posters and engage in discussions) and scientific sessions (presentations that are delivered to a larger audience). The conference also includes smaller workshops and education sessions for nurses, junior neurologists in training, and media. The conference is a great platform for announcing breaking news in MS research and treatments and provides an opportunity for researchers, clinicians, and trainees to share the hottest data from their laboratories. Stay tuned for all this information! This year the research team will be delivering live updates throughout the meeting via Twitter (@Dr_KarenLee ), Facebook ( Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada ), Instagram (@mssocietycanada ) and my blog . We are excited to hear about the latest advances in MS and report it to our MS Community, including, interviews on researchers that we support.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531952336786498/Imaginary-Pain---MS-Connection	"The buzzing throughout my arms, hands, legs and feet had not let up for 3 full days. My annual checkup with my neurologist was just a day away, so I figured, what better timing? I practically danced into the office and was so excited to get some answers about this newfound pain. Enter the man of the hour, and come to find out, it’s… all… in my head? Excuse me? Everyone tends to experience very different symptoms when it comes to their own personal journey with MS. Some people react poorly to the heat, some have chronic headaches. For me, the pain I experience is something similar to growing pains. You know, that stretching and throbbing sensation you used to get when you were hitting your growth spurt? Now, take those growing pains and amplify that by about 1,000,000. That is the pain I experience most often in my own personal journey with MS. I explained this to my neurologist, and he genuinely told me it was all in my head; that other than “numbness and tingling,” there is no other type of pain associated with multiple sclerosis. When I stepped into that office, hopeful and looking for an explanation, I left feeling very distraught. No, a better word would be angry . I was angry that this was only happening to me and that no one else experienced this type of pain. I was angry that this disease chose me to send these abnormal throbbing sensations throughout my body and deep into my core. What made me special? Absolutely nothing. I spent some time thinking on it and concluded that I was not the one who was different here, but that I was given some faulty information. I decided to reach out to my supportive community through my Instagram account and asked other MS warriors like myself if they had ever experienced this pain, too. The conclusion? I got about 15 messages in my inbox singing the hallelujah choir that someone else understood. That their neurologists had also told them it was all their imagination. It was both invigorating and terrifying. I felt so reassured to know that others understood exactly what I was going through, but I was also concerned at just how many physicians are out there telling their patients that their very real pain is only in their head. Since the day of my diagnosis when my first neurologist told me my quality of life would suffer and I would never run again, I have questioned the word of others. I respect them for their education and appreciate the help they provide me, but I question everything . I run at least 5K a week and live in the gym. My quality of life is A-Okay, so I proved that first doctor wrong. I proved the second one wrong with my supportive community of amazing MS warriors, too. At the end of the day, our experience is our own, but always remember something: this is your story. You are not crazy, you are justified in how you feel, and you are never alone. Keep pushing forward and remember that together we are stronger than MS!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692354226208631525/Its-Nice-to-Be-Understood	"Last week I was honored to attend and emcee the annual conference of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland. It was, of course, an informative event with speakers from around Europe presenting research results as well as great tips for living our best lives with (and in spite of) multiple sclerosis (MS) . If you care to sift through the day, the live stream was captured on video for all to review. While I did learn much, from how important exercise is to healthy brain chemistry to the differences between how people with MS are treated in the United Kingdom versus Ireland versus the United States, as is oft the case with such events, it was the off-line and sidebar conversations that were most helpful. The Power of Being in a Room Full of People With MS. Time after time I remember and forget, only to be reminded again, just how powerful it is to be in a room filled with people living with — and trying to live well with — MS. Not everyone is living with their disease the same way. Not everyone at the conference was doing as well as when I saw them at last year’s event. Still, from the newly diagnosed trying to find information in the white noise of the early stages to those with advanced MS who can only travel with accompanied assistance, we all sought another addition to our MS tool kit . Those in attendance ranged from the passionately outspoken to the timid. They were current leaders of industry and common laborers. We were the medically retired and those seeking to stay employed . There were parents and grandparents, young people, and even teens with MS in attendance. And there were caregivers , care partners, spouses, family, friends, and employers We all lived with multiple sclerosis, even if not everyone had been diagnosed with the disease. We laughed, we learned. We commiserated, we cried. We caught up with those we’d not seen in far too long, we missed those unable to attend. We mourned some who have left this world. We quietly plotted ourselves on the timeline of MS and gauged our progression with those we’ve seen year over year. We were doing better than some we met and not as well as others. We talked of exercise and of diets, of family members and of pets. We did what every group of friends who only meet up occasionally do, which made us feel “normal” in our abnormalities. RELATED: When MS Makes ‘Normal’ a Moving Target. ‘The Best Club I Never Wanted to Join’. I suppose it’s impossible to say that one part of the event was more important than any other. So much good intent was all around us. But I will say that research outcomes will always shift, professional opinions will evolve, and PowerPoint presentations will always be tweaked. What won’t change at events like this is the power of a group of different-minded people, from all walks of life with little in common other than a disease, becoming fast friends. “It’s the best club I never wanted to join,” I once heard someone say in reference to people with MS . The disease — and more importantly the fact that we are all striving for our best possible lives while having the disease — is what links us all. That fact allows for us to reach out into what sometimes seems like the darkest of dark times and find someone who has been there before . The Special Bond of Not Having to Explain Myself. Some people find comfort in more regular self-help groups or occasional meet-ups with a few people living with MS. Not everyone, however, has those available, for a number of reasons. Even if we can’t get together with others with MS (or think we mightn’t want to) all that often, I find a special bond and comfort when I don’t have to explain why I have to excuse myself to the loo six times during a conversation, don’t have to suffer the pitiful looks when I struggle out of a chair, or don’t feel that more than a nod and a wink is needed to excuse myself early from an evening of fun. If I really think about it, I’m probably a better friend to those dear ones who don’t have MS because of the things I’ve learned from my friends who do. Wishing you and your family the best of health. My book, Chef Interrupted , is available on Amazon .

"BACKGROUND: Prevention of long-term disability is the goal of therapeutic intervention in Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS). The Bayesian Risk Estimate for MS at Onset (BREMSO) gives an individual risk score predicting disease evolution into Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS). We investigated whether BREMSO correlates with physical disability, cognitive dysfunction, and regional brain atrophy early in MS. METHODS: One hundred RRMS patients with at least two years of follow-up were enrolled. BREMSO score as well as Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS), Timed 25-Foot Walk Test (T25-FW) and 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT), were assessed. Intracranial volume (ICV), subcortical gray matter structures and corpus callosum (CC) were automatically segmented on MRI images and their volumes measured. RESULTS: BREMSO score correlated negatively with SDMT at visit1 (β = -0.33, p = 0.019), visit2 (β = -0.34, p = 0.017) and visit3 (β = -0.34, p = 0.014), and positively with MSSS at visit1 (r = 0.38, p = 0.006), visit2 (r = 0.47, p. CONCLUSIONS: BREMSO score at onset correlated with physical disability (MSSS), cognitive function (SDMT) and CC volume measurements in patients with early MS. Copyright © 2018.

Thursday September 20 2018 10:50 AM. This week Declan Groeger shares with us what it is like being a man living with MS. I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in 1988. Married with two small children, a mortgage and an overdraft. The day the doctor said “You have MS” , my life changed forever. At that time MS had no known cause, no treatment and no cure. Any plans I had for the future were left swinging in the wind. The cause is still unknown, a cure has still not been found but there are many treatment options available now and more in the pipeline. How did I feel on hearing those unforgettable words? It was 30 years ago and memories dim with time, and MS, but I do remember being overcome with emotions, crying and wondering what path my illness would take. I did take heart from the fact that a maternal uncle had been living with MS for more than 20 years and he was doing fine. Did I feel inadequate after the diagnosis? Certainly not in the immediate aftermath, and probably not in the early years while I was feeling good. I felt so good that I sought a second opinion after ten years. This unfortunately confirmed my diagnosis. Deep down I knew I’d been grasping at straws- the signs and symptoms had become more apparent and I knew the downward slide had begun. I started medicating at this point. I never saw myself in the classic ‘hunter gatherer’ role but I knew that as time passed any role I would, or could, play in our family life would be seriously affected. Jean and I discussed it and agreed that we couldn’t rely on my ability to remain in gainful employment and bring in a steady income and from then on Jean donned the mantle of bread-winner. I was no longer ‘the man of the house’, although I remained in full-time employment for a further 22 years. MS had relegated me to the second division. That was the first knock to my manliness and many more knocks were to follow over the years. I was afraid of being perceived as lazy as long as my illness remained invisible. That’s not to say I wanted everyone to know I had MS. It was my private torment and I didn’t know how to handle its invisibility. All of the people who mattered to me had learned to live with, and accept, my constraints a long time before I did. I slowly came to realise that I was the only one who looked at me the way I looked at me. Jean never made me feel inadequate or lazy, that was all down to me. My share of the housework was to look after the garden but I always felt I should be doing more. One of my earliest pieces of Assistive Technology was a ride-on lawn mower obviously needed to cut the grass but also to move tools etc. around. Every job took much longer for me, used twice as much energy and in 2014 I threw in the towel on that particular activity. I was never a big drinker but I did enjoy having a few pints. I never had a ‘local’ as such but even that ‘not drinking much’ suffered from MS; I was no longer comfortable going to a pub. The prospect of wobbling my way to the bar or toilet became too much of a struggle and I was very much aware of people watching and silently passing judgment. I’m not drunk I have MS. Men of my age group are not great at discussing and sharing our thoughts and feelings and I am no different. I kept my feelings of inadequacy under tight control. There was no reason to burden anyone else; suck it up and get on with life. I would urge other men living with MS not to suffer in silence but to seek out help and talk about it."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4699569004696920424/Improving-cognitive-function-in-MS:-A-researcher-looking-to-make-a-difference-for-people-diagnosed-with-progressive-MS---Blog---MS-Society-of-Canada	"Cognitive impairment, a research priority for the MS Society of Canada, affects a significant proportion of people living with MS. Multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause a reduction in brain size (also called brain atrophy). Research has shown that this atrophy and lesions developed in MS can be linked to the presence of cognitive difficulties. Cognitive difficulties affect up to seventy percent of individuals living with progressive MS, predominantly impacting information processing and speed, learning and memory, executive function and perceptual processing. Also, individuals themselves have voiced cognitive impairment as an area of concern that needs to be addressed. Five years ago, I traveled around the country and engaged the MS Community (researchers, caregivers, individuals living with MS) to find out what areas of research are important to them—cognition and mental health was one of them! The good news? There is evidence to suggest that cognitive rehabilitation has the potential to improve cognitive function. There is a need for effective cognitive rehabilitation for those living with MS. Cognitive rehabilitation aims to enhance a person’s ability to process and interpret information, and to improve the ability to function in family and community life. A few studies have already evaluated cognitive rehabilitation strategies to improve various areas of cognition, including memory, communication, and attention skills. While a great deal of progress has been made in identifying treatments for cognitive dysfunction, there is more research that needs to be conducted. Many studies lack control (mock treatment) group, are not large enough to make adequate conclusions from the interventions, or are limited to the MS population in general (all types of MS) or only people with relapsing-remitting MS. Cognition and Exercise. One promising intervention that may improve cognition is exercise. Historically, individuals living with MS were advised to avoid physical exertion for fear that physical activity will make them feel worse. Over the past few decades, new research has uncovered considerable benefits associated with increased physical activity, and perceptions among the MS community have shifted toward encouraging a more active lifestyle. There is evidence that physical activity and exercise can help to maintain the individual’s independence, enhance their quality of life, and lead to improved cognitive functioning due to the beneficial effects of physical activity on brain health. However, the effects of exercise on cognition has been predominantly evaluated on persons with relapsing-remitting MS. Furthermore, different exercise interventions have shown mixed results on cognition which could be attributed to differences in exercises methodologies (exercise type, intensity, frequency and program duration) used between studies. There is a need to perform randomized control trials, with larger sample sizes, longer durations, and broader evaluations to better assess the role of exercise on cognition. Furthermore, when looking at rehabilitation in MS, a single intervention may not be sufficient in improving symptoms – synergistic approaches may be required. Therefore, strategies that combine two interventions, such as cognitive rehabilitation and exercise, may have the potential to produce the greatest improvements in MS. MS Society-supported research aims to improve cognition by combining cognitive rehabilitation and exercise. Recently, we announced support of a $5 million project which will test if cognitive rehabilitation, or exercise, or a combined approach of cognitive rehabilitation and exercise will improve cognitive function in individuals living with progressive MS. This clinical study is the first of its kind to use a large sample that incorporates many countries and has the potential to define how best to treat cognitive dysfunction in people diagnosed with progressive MS. The researcher leading the effort to improve cognition in people diagnosed with progressive MS. The researcher leading this large project on improving cognitive function through a randomized clinical trial is Dr. Anthony Feinstein. Dr. Anthony Feinstein is a Neuropsychiatrist and Associate Scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. He is also a Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto. Dr. Feinstein has researched behavioral disorders in people with MS for 26 years and runs a busy clinical practice in which over 80 percent of the patients have MS. Dr. Feinstein’s studies entail detailed neuropsychological testing, brain imaging (both structural and functional) and quantification of mood symptoms. More recently, Dr. Feinstein has also begun a series of studies looking at how cannabis might affect cognition and brain imaging in people with MS. Currently, the Society is supporting two projects led by Dr. Feinstein, one is the clinical trial for improving cognition and another which is evaluating the effects of cannabis on cognition. Learn more about Dr. Feinstein:. How did you become interested in MS research? What inspires you to continue advancing research in this field? I first became interested in multiple sclerosis research after my residency, which was in London, England. My PhD was devoted to detecting cognitive difficulties in people with MS and looking for correlates with brain MRI. This was a nascent field at the time and as such there was a very small literature on these topics. After completing my PhD, I continued to pursue my interest in multiple sclerosis. Indeed, it is fair to say that it was through my PhD that I developed a lifelong interest in this particular disorder and the behavioral consequence of it. I continue to remain an active researcher because there are so many unanswered questions. MS is a fascinating disease and the degree to which it can affect behavior across a wide domain has yet to be fully explored. While much more is known about the behavioral consequence of MS now compared to when I first entered the field the advances in technology are continuing to open up new research possibilities which ultimately benefits patient care. What do you enjoy most about doing research and what are some of the challenges you face? What I enjoy most about research is trying to be innovative. While I recognize that replication is, of course, important and essential, coming up with new findings which can affect the quality of patient care is rewarding. The challenges faced are those of obtaining funding in an increasingly competitive research environment and retaining bright young investigators who often want to move on to other opportunities because of better financial and work-related opportunities. Describe the importance and level of collaboration in your research? Collaboration is essential for my research. To begin with, I could not begin to do my research without having good relationships with my colleagues in Neurology who refer patients to me, both clinically and for research purposes. I also collaborate with colleagues in Neuroimaging and Neuropsychology and more recently, Engineering. These links are pivotal to the success of my research work. How important is the support from the MS Society in enabling you to conduct research? The support from the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada has been integral to my research success. The Society has funded my studies looking at brain MRI correlates of depression, the development of computerized tests of cognition for people with MS, a series of studies exploring the cognitive and imaging changes linked to cannabis use in people with MS, the studies investigates the prevalence, clinical significance and cognitive correlates of pseudobulbar affect in people with MS and more recently the large multi-centre study looking at cognitive rehabilitation and exercise in people with progressive MS.

"“The common one is when the work environment gets loud and busy, but the newest, and one that seems the strangest, is any warehouse type store. The extremely tall and long aisles, even when they're practically empty.” — Amy L., living with MS. “Large crowds. Bright big stores. Sometimes I go to the store, walk in, say ‘nope,’ and go home.” — Bonnie W., living with MS. “The grocery store and heavy traffic. Makes me feel scatterbrained and ‘lost.’” — Amber A., living with MS. “An environment I'm not used to, physically and/or mentally. Still don't know how to deal with them.” — Rona M., living with MS. “Being away from home too long. I get very anxious.” — Sherri H., living with MS. “Being tired can trigger it, real bright lights, a lot of motion, lights, noise at the same time, trying to listen and talk in a setting with other input.” — Kelly H., living with MS. “Fatigue is probably the number one cause of my sensory overload, but it's not always the culprit. If there are too many noises at once, they all seem to be competing to be the loudest, resulting in complete overload. In turn, I become a complete wreck. Tremors, feeling extremely uneasy, and anxious. All this holds true with an overload of any other sensual stimulus or combination of sensory overload events.” — Gail F., living with MS. “Someone who sits next to me and talks nonstop, especially in the late afternoon when extra fatigued, or just loud people with lots of energy … I'm like chocolate on a hot pavement … I melt down to a mess.” — Lisa F., living with MS. “In restaurants, I request not to be seated directly under a speaker. Music, combined with people's voices and kitchen clatter, drives me crazy.” — Connie R., living with MS. “Dinner at Texas Roadhouse with all the birthdays and singing and celebrations. Just gets to be too much!” — Judy C., living with MS. “Noise coming from multiple directions and high-pitched sounds like the clanking of dishes and silverware together, or children screeching. Restaurants with high ceilings and open kitchens are the worst for me because every sound just feels multiplied.” — Erin H., living with MS. “Being in a crowd or a loud room where I'm unable to tune some of the noise out. Hustling and bustling crowds are the worst between the sounds, the people, and my balance issues.” — Cindi P., living with MS. “Too many voices at once.”— Robin G., living with MS. Too many things to count. “Bright lights, too loud, children screeching, hot with odd smells, some industrial sounds, sometimes even reading can be too much if the lights are wrong or the setting is overwhelming.” — Alysin P., living with MS. “Going to the grocery store, being tired, the doctors telling me too much all at once, restaurants, people who don’t control their screaming, running kids.” — Stacy N., living with MS. “Large stores with a lot of color and visual stimulation; flashing or strobe lights especially in the dark; too much, too loud, or specific types of noise such as screeching or sirens; crowds or fast-paced and bustling activity.” — Polly P., living with MS.

Three hours at this workshop learning improvisation fundamentals has changed my perspective on life and MS. When we first got to the class, we were asked to choose an intention card, and I chose one that said, “Take risks.” I was taking this class because I wanted to challenge myself and to live outside of the safety bubble I had created. After we all introduced ourselves and stated our intentions, we split up into pairs and played our first improvisation game called 1, 2, 3. All we had to do was take turns saying 1, 2 and 3 and if either one of us messed up at all, we both had to raise our arms in the air and shout, “Yay!”.."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4706000549259111977/Discussions---MS-Connection	"Aug 26, 2018 2:40 PM. Most likely MS *. About a month back I started noticing slight lack of sensation on right cheek - difficult to describe because if I touch on both cheeks with fingers it would feel the same but somehow the right side face would feel as if it has some glue on it or dry skin. Long story short, eventually went to neuro who prescribed brain MRI with and without contrast. By now I was convinced that this must be due to MS (I generally tend to settle on worst outcome expectations). The notes from radiologist came back with following -. ""There is no evidence of an acute infarct on diffusion-weighted imaging. No intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial fluid collections are seen. There is no mass effect midline shift. Sagittal images demonstrate normal midline structures. No leptomeningeal or parenchymal enhancing lesions are seen postcontrast imaging. No significant white matter lesions are seen on T2 and FLAIR imaging. Few scattered foci are noted within the subcortical white matter. The major intracranial flow voids are unremarkable on T2-weighted imaging. Ethmoid air cell and bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal thickening. Left sphenoid sinus small mucous retention cyst."" I thought this was a good news and may be sinus is causing it - until I saw the neuro back. As per the neuro the scattered foci hyperintensities does not indicate a perfect MRI and MS cannot be ruled out even though the images do not show classic MS presentation. As per what I was explained, those two spots of hyper intensities are not where typically MS lesions are found but yet at my age (40) I should not have those hyperintensities. So now I have been prescribed blood tests to check for lyme, lupus and other auto immune deseases as well as spinal tap. I have had no migraine headaches or any injuries in past. I do have alergy and sinus issues. I had few concerned questions so thought to turn here for help -. 1. How likely this indicates MS? I am wondering why would radiologist see the hyperintensities but yet say no demyelination or any other concerns? May be not an easy question to answer with such limited info but I'm curious. 2. What is the likely hood of spinal tap providing answer? I have not been presecribed Spinal MRI. Should I ask for it? 3. Is there any chance Vit-B12 deficiency could cause this? My vit B-12 level recently came 330, which is on the lower side but yet I am told by physician and neuro that it is within the range and levels have to be signficiantly below the range. They also said it doesn't usually cause any facial numbness. I would like to wait for my diagnosis to come back but in the meantime, are there any good links for me to read on vegetarian diet with MS, drug options and how to consider the best option, how quickly upon finding about the diagnosis you would need to be on drugs ( currently I donot have any symptoms other than the slight lack of sensation I feel). Aug 27, 2018 1:16 AM. s, we can not speak about whether or not there is indication of ms, sometimes doctors are not even sure. The report you got on the mri was pretty informative about what was and was not going on, it is , in my opinion, seriously impressive. I have had plenty of mris and most have never rulled out anything. You got your money's worth. And your neuro seems to be diligent. There are many psots here about diet, what has worked for them and what has not. You can also check on nmss.org to see what they have posted, also multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com to see what they have to say. You can ask the neuro why he thinks a spinal mri is not indicated and see if you agree with his impression or if you want to request one. Aug 27, 2018 9:39 AM. Hi there,. While we're not able to answer your medical questions, we do have some information on nutrition and disease-modifying treatments we can share:. I hope this is helpful - also hoping that you get answers soon. Sep 29, 2018 10:36 AM. Spintal tap results came back. Not sure what to make of it, have apptment in few days with the doctor. CSF Oligoclonal Bands Number - 0. Following all showing in the range -. CSF IgG/Albumin Ratio. CSF IgG Synthesis Rate (<0.0 mg/day). WBC, CSF (0/mm3). IgG, CSF. Glucose, CSF. Myelin Basic Protein. Nothing seems out of range on report at least so will see what the doc says as brain MRI didn't directly indicate MS either. In the mean time I took Vit B12 shots and started B-12 methylcobalamin supplement afterwards as well and want to believe improved significantly."

Thursday August 16 2018 10:16 AM. This week Fergal Hughes wonders about what the future holds for him in terms of his MS ... and realises that he is more concerned with 'here and now'. I was diagnosed in January 1996. The diagnosing doctor told me that he believed my type of MS to be remitting/relapsing (RRMS) and what that would more than likely entail for me. I remember in the days following my diagnosis I bought every book on the topic of MS that I could find in town. I then went home and promptly threw them all under the bed! Looking back, I think I was just trying to make sure that I at least physically ‘possessed’ as much knowledge as I could (I guess I was trying to get a sense of ownership over this unexpected addition to my life). But then I simultaneously created my own little ‘Pandora’s Box’ in my room, never to be opened for fear of what it might contain. Coincidentally, my MS went into remission at that exact time, allowing me to develop a healthy denial about it. [Aside: If I remember correctly, I think I never actually read those books. In 1998, two years after the start of my remission, MS returned with one hell of a relapse, going so far as to give me a permanent limp in my right leg. Now, in 2018, I can say that I believe I’ve learned that attitude can be at least just as important as knowledge. In my opinion, there really is a lot to be said for that old chestnut, P ositive M ental A ttitude. Over 20 years since my diagnosis, I’ve developed two new conditions, both neuralgias and both facial/cranial extreme nerve pains. One is called Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN) and the other is Cluster Headaches (CH). Nobody told me beforehand that I was going to develop these. There was no medical prognosis, best guesses, psychics, witch doctors, NOTHING . I just suddenly acquired the conditions and I had to quickly learn how to deal with them. And I’m still learning how to deal with them. Again looking back, a doctor or neurosurgeon or whoever, might have hinted TN and CH might be on the cards but personally, I reckon that that would have been a potential disaster. I say this considering the proven effect that fear and stress can have on a newly diagnosed person with MS. At the end of the day, there’s only so much one can do about the future. Right now the most important thing for me is dealing with the here and now."

Has anyone suggested an alternative? like treating it as if it is ms instead of a tumor? Have they done a lumbar puncture? Sep 09, 2018 10:23 PM. Hello I hope that this response finds you well on April 30 2018, I went to the emergency departmenr with lots of vision in my right eye and it’s pretty severe gate disturbance they found a lesion on my brain and set me up for an MRI the next morning and a neurosurgeon I met with the neurosurgeon for days after my MRI and he advised me that I had an in operable brain tumor he gave me 1 million things that it could be but the one that he kept coming back to was glioblastoma The initial pathology finding at time of surgery was Glioblastoma and I was told I had 3 months to live. however four days later he called me at home and told me I do not have a Glioblastoma, I did not have any kind of Brain Cancer. I was told I have a single tumefactive inflammatory lesion. He referred me to a neurologist. I had very high dose IV steroid treatment followed by extended oral taper dose of prednisone. I am waiting for my three month follow-up MRI in eight days.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702046763716916019/My-mom:-the-fiercest-competitor-I-know---Blog---MS-Society-of-Canada	"Guest post by: Christine Sinclair. When I was a young girl, I remember my mom started using a cane. I never understood why. It wasn’t until the first time I saw her cry that the answers began to unfold in front of me. I was no older than 12 when I found out my mom was living with multiple sclerosis (MS). When you’re a kid, your parents are indestructible, and that’s what my mom was to me. But as years went by, I watched MS chip away at aspects of her life, and her fight against the chronic disease became tougher and tougher. You see, my mom was an athlete, just like me. When I was growing up, she was my head coach for soccer, and as I progressed, she became the president of the club that my brother and I played at. She played all kinds of sports – soccer, track, baseball, water skiing, you name it – and coming from a family of athletes, it was routine for us to go to the park every week and play outside. With her MS, she’s been forced to adapt her lifestyle. As a fellow athlete, it breaks my heart to watch my mom, who was so physically active, over the years, seeing that slowly stripped away from her. I know that if she could, she would love to bring her grandkids to the park. My mom was always a fierce competitor, but never had I seen her battle a hurdle as immense as MS, where her biggest opponent is herself. Because of that, it took her some time to come to grips with her situation. I don’t think you’re ever okay with MS, but accepting the reality and making the best of that has been the biggest journey for her, and the rest of my family. Today, my mom is still the strongest person I know and my number one champion. She currently resides in a care home, which can be challenging at times. Cognitively, she’s still my mom – friendly, social, and as sharp as ever – but physically, she’s placed in a facility where she is 20 years younger than everyone else. Being the outgoing person that she is, she struggles with the lack of human interaction she has at her home. She’s even become friends with the employees. Naturally, she loves having visitors, so our big family goes to see her every opportunity we get. Some of my teammates visit her too. Although she lives in Vancouver and I’m in Portland, my mom’s journey with MS affects me every day. Just knowing what she’s constantly going through weighs heavy on my heart. But my mom always worked to not let her disease affect my life – career, or otherwise. She encouraged me to go away for university and always inspired me to follow my dreams of becoming a professional soccer player. In the past few years, my priorities have shifted. Soccer is still my passion, but family has become ever so important to me. Whenever I have a couple of days off, I drive from Portland, Oregon to B.C. to spend time with my family. If you ask me, the time couldn’t be better spent. I wish people knew how debilitating it is for a person living with MS. The lack of options available for people living with it, such as the ability to work, is astounding. These are amazing and inspiring people who deserve all the opportunities in the world, and they just need to be given a chance. I hope that by getting involved in Burgers to Beat MS , I can help spread that message. I took on this campaign to step out of my comfort zone, which is on the soccer field. I want to be a part of something bigger than just a game. With the impact that MS has had on my family, I feel like I am finally at a place in my life where I know I can help make a difference. MS hits close to home, and I want to do everything I can to help people, just like my mom, enjoy life to the fullest. Burgers to Beat MS Day will take place August 16 where $2 from every Teen Burger® will go to the MS Society of Canada. Help Christine Sinclair and others who are affected by multiple sclerosis by supporting the campaign and bringing us one step closer to finding a cure for the chronic disease."

"medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4724107214973392528/African-Americans-Show-Better-Adherence-and-Satisfaction-with-Gilenya-Than-Injectable-DMTs,-Phase-4-Study-Finds"	"JULY 30, 2018 by: Jose Marques Lopes, PhD. African-Americans with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) show higher adherence and greater satisfaction when treated with oral Gilenya ( fingolimod , by Novartis ) than with injectable therapies, according to a new study. The research, “ Treatment retention on fingolimod compared with injectable multiple sclerosis therapies in African-American patients: A subgroup analysis of a randomized phase 4 study ,” was published in the journal. Although the efficacy and safety of injectable disease-modifying therapies (iDMTs) used as first-line treatments for relapsing forms of MS are well-established, patients are also known from real-world studies to often discontinue using them and become non-adherent to these therapies. Research has shown that poor treatment retention, which includes adherence to and persistence in use over the long term, is key for better outcomes in MS. To optimize treatment, clinicians need information on the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and convenience of therapies in specific patient groups. Studies show that African-American MS patients can have a more aggressive disease course than Caucasians, including a greater likelihood of disability accumulation. Although not widely studied for MS, this patient population in diseases like hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma are known to have lower treatment retention rates than those of other patient groups. The Phase 4 PREFER MS study ( NCT01623596 ), sponsored by Novartis, randomized about 850 RRMS patients ages 8–65 to oral Gilenya or an injectable DMT. Its goal was to better understand retention to treatment with Gilenya in specific populations. All enrolled had either never taken any iDMT previously or only one such medication; patients allowed one treatment switch after 12 weeks or earlier for safety or efficacy reasons."																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693250054066254007/Rise-Up---MS-Connection	"Resilience is the capacity to recover from difficulties and finding your strength within. Where do I begin? I’m 39 years old and have been through my share of difficulties. If I’ve learned anything, it’s that no matter what happens, you have to get back up and fight all the curve balls that this life throws you. 2005 and 2006 were bittersweet life changing years for me. I tragically lost my 2-year-old son in June 2005. To say I was devastated would be an understatement. Are there any words to describe that kind of pain? Before the shock of it all could settle in, I unexpectedly became pregnant with my daughter. I didn’t even know how to feel. In May 2006 on Mother’s Day, I was blessed with my daughter and immediately felt the warmth of her love. I felt I was given a second chance in life. She was my anchor, and she saved me in so many ways. Life seemed to be moving forward. I had been hired at a new job, and I was set to begin that month. But I woke up one day in early October and noticed that I had numbness in my torso area from my spine to my navel. I didn’t think much of it. I just figured it was a pinched nerve or something. I waited to see if it would subside, it didn’t. I called my physician, and she ordered an MRI and a neurologist appointment. I was confident that it would be something that would resolve itself, but after a second MRI, the neurologist told me what he was about to tell me would change my life forever. He broke the devastating news I had MS. I was in shock. I arrived at my mother’s house and when I saw her holding my baby, I broke down crying. I was so scared. What would I do now? Will my daughter grow up without her mother? Why me? So much loss, my life was falling apart. All hope was lost once again. I must have Googled everything about this disease and had so many questions. I learned that this disease affects everyone differently, and there was no one way to deal with this. I just had to bounce back and be stronger than ever—not only for me but for my family. I was determined to not have MS control my life. And that’s just what I did—I moved on, I had no choice. I was learning to live this new life, and I was getting back into a routine when, once again, that cringing familiar feeling was back. Now it was my leg and other side of my torso area, I had vision changes, and the fatigue was overwhelming. I went back to that dark place where I felt all hope was lost once again. I was sick, I couldn’t do much and had to leave work. I couldn’t handle it all: a one-year-old, a stressful job, steroids, injections. I needed to be rescued. I prayed for some answers and clarity. I was depressed, 280 pounds, a little over five foot one, 27, and in an abusive relationship. I was so angry, fed up and tired. I felt cheated. I desperately needed some change in my life, and that is what I did… again. I bought a house on my own. I left my toxic relationship, changed my diet and started to exercise lightly. It was then I began to understand the meaning of resiliency in my own life. I’ve learned that this life is like a yo-yo—you always have to prepare for bad things to happen. But I can reassure you that it will be okay. My story isn’t linear. Every time I thought I was on a positive trajectory, I’ve been shot down. It’s been marked by ups and downs, and it will surely be like that forever. I struggle every day, but I won’t give up. I know I have to be resilient, be a role model for my daughter and others going through similar problems, never lose faith, and most of all, hope."

Thursday July 26 2018 11:12 AM. ‘But you look so good’…. MS & Me blogger Niall McGahon shares his thoughts and reaction on hearing this compliment. “But you look so good….” For some, this expression can be one of the most frustrating things to hear when you have MS. For me, it is simply someone paying me a compliment and my immediate reply is “Thanks a million…”. Personally, the most frustrating aspect of having MS - is having this progressive illness . No two days are the same nor do they have any predictability. This is where I have tried to take back control of my life and put a bit of manners on MS! Now this was by no means an instantaneous migration and did not happen overnight. It was and still is difficult to make such major lifestyle changes and I am continuously learning each and every day. Many times, of course it does get in the way, or rather my right leg gets in the way of my left leg. Suddenly the footpath and I are about to become very close friends! But like all things you learn to live with and give yourself the best possible chance of limiting the relapses through exercise, major dietary change, meditation and focusing on what I can do and not on what I may or may not be able to do in the future. I follow the OMS program for all of this. The great sports phycologist, Dr Bob Rotella has a simple concept used for golf of “staying in the present”. These golfers play their next shot until they run out of holes and then add up their score. I have taken this from my golf and tried to apply it to my illness, simply take each day as it comes and deal with that day. The rest of the days are, for the most part outside of my control. Since being diagnosed with MS in 2014 and having many experiences since, I have become acutely aware of how well I am in the grand scheme of human health. I have been in hospital for various treatments and have seen people who have much harder crosses to bear than me. So as a result, I am trying to make myself more aware of when someone is paying me a compliment. I have no idea what that person is going through, yet they have taken the time to think about me and what I am going through by paying me a compliment. The correct thing to do is simply say thank you. If you can add to peoples’ knowledge of MS along the way through conversation, then brilliant. The greater the understanding of what a person with MS goes through daily, the better. You may be in pain, you may be heavily fatigued, and you may not be in a very good emotional place. What I have learnt over the last 4 years is that the person saying that you look good could be in the very same place but for a totally different reason, so saying thank you is sometimes best for all.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531446148141321/MS-Fatigue-med??????	"Hi there. I was diagnosed 8 years this September. My main symptoms are extreme fatigue and migraines with a hint of optic neuritis on occasion plus bladder issues. The fatigue is my big issue. I tend to feel normal and do errands then clearly I did too much and feel like I went from 90% to 1% energy in 2 minutes. I try to just do the bare minimum errand wise and try not to over do it but its hard. My doctor gave me a script for Adderall but I was uncomfortable with taking that on a daily basis. I already don't sleep well due to the bladder issues being worse at night time. I found on another blog a med called Advanced Ambrotose made by Mannatech. Got it off Amazon recently, and just started it today. Worst cade it does nothing but if I could even just have a little more energy that would be great. My question is, has anyone tried this med before? What was your experience with it? Did it help with any of your symptoms? Did it help with fatigue at all?? Thanks for the help!!!!"																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4708182355239704453/Potential-new-MS-drug-could-regenerate-myelin	"Published Thursday 19 July 2018. New research could lead to treatments for multiple sclerosis that regenerate myelin, the fatty coating that insulates nerve fibers and protects signals between brain cells. Scientists from the University at Buffalo in New York find that the receptor muscarinic type 3 (M3R) is a ""key regulator"" of remyelination, which is the process that replenishes lost myelin. M3R is found on the surface of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), the precursors to the cells that make myelin. A receptor is a cell-surface protein that triggers certain cell functions when it encounters and binds to a matching unique molecule. The scientists showed that blocking M3R increased remyelination in mice that had human OPCs transplanted into them. Senior study author Fraser J. Sim, an associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology, and his colleagues report their findings in a paper now published in The Journal of Neuroscience . As myelin is destroyed, it forms lesions that weaken signals that travel along the nerve fibers, leading to disrupted communication between brain cells. Scientists have learned that the disease also damages the nerve cells themselves."																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693241878567248389/PT-for-back-pain	"Hi again, Five weeks ago I woke up with low back, outer hip and thigh pain. I could barely walk. I saw a dr. but not my regular one as she had the day off. He said it's Sciatica and to use Aspercreme. Yeah, that didn't work so I saw another dr.(my regular doc off again) at same clinic who sent me to PT, after an x-ray showed spine and hips ok. The therapist did all kinds of tests and said that it's not Sciatica and my spine seems fine, no signs of herniated discs. She said I have muscle weakness and have to strengthen my core to help with that. She also checked my reflexes and I nearly kicked her!!! I was told to warn any doctors that do this test so they don't get kicked, lol. She was so nice and friendly! Anyway, three days later I awoke and all pain was gone! It had left just the same as it arrived! I saw her again a few days later and she was as perplexed as I was! She had me do some stretches and we both agreed it would be silly to keep seeing her when I had no pain at all. These symptoms just keep getting weirder. I see an MS specialist next week in Pittsburg, and his reviews sound promising. He listens carefully and is patient and writes down notes and gives you a copy. I'm not getting my hopes up, but it sure would be nice if he can figure this all out. At the very least I hope he doesn't just drop me like the others and helps me find an answer. I will update when and if I get any answers. Thanks so much to all of you on this site. You are all so kind and helpful to all of us who are scared, worried and confused. After a while all our individual stories probably sound the same to you, but you still help us to feel better.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4706056550942364723/Signs-You-Are-Sabotaging-Your-MS-Treatment---Skipping-taking-your-medications	"MS is an autoimmune disorder, where the body’s immune system attacks myelin. Myelin, which forms a protective shield and insulates the lining of nerve fibers, is crucial to proper functioning of the nervous system. MS drugs are immuno-suppressive, which means that they work by suppressing, or altering, the activity of the body's immune system, thereby protecting myelin and preventing further destruction of the myelin sheath. Once you stop taking them, you allow your immune system to return to full strength and to attack your myelin again. You may not have any sign that this is happening until it’s too late, and you have a relapse. What happens when you skip your meds. Your medications do not cure MS, but they do reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and the development of new brain lesions. In addition, some medications may slow down the progression of MS, reducing future disability. “Clinical studies show that patients who had gaps in therapy lasting 90 days or more were nearly twice as likely to experience a severe relapse,” says Dr. Gabriel Pardo, director of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Multiple Sclerosis Center of Excellence. “It’s important for patients to find a routine that works for them and that they can adhere to,” he says. “Patients might feel well between relapses, but in fact the disease is progressing and they might not recover from their next relapse. The disease is still progressing, although the patient doesn’t know it. The brain has a great ability to repair itself and find new pathways. But if you create a roadblock the brain can get around it some of the time, but not all of the time.”."																																																																																							
"medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4723643521850056294/Relationship-Among-MS,-Sleep-Quality,-and-Sleep-Hygiene-Behaviors---LiveWiseMS"	"The Relationship Among Multiple Sclerosis–Related Symptoms, Sleep Quality, and Sleep Hygiene Behaviors. Pamela Newland, Rebecca A. Lorenz, Judith M. Smith, Emily Dean, John Newland,. Journal of Neuroscience Nursing. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships among multiplesclerosis (MS)–related symptoms, sleep hygiene behaviors, and sleep quality in adults with MS who self-report fatigue. Background: Fatigue is a frequent, prevalent symptom among adults with MS. Few studies have examined the relationship among fatigue and other symptoms with sleep quality and sleep behaviors. Design: This is a descriptive correlational study. Methods: A convenience sample of 39 adults with MS were recruited for the study. Instruments used included the revised MS Related Symptom Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Correlations examined the relationships among fatigue and other MS symptoms with sleep quality and sleep hygiene behaviors. Results: The frequency of several symptoms correlated with poor sleep quality, and fatigue frequency was higher in those who used electronic devices and practiced poor sleep hygiene behaviors. Nursing Implications: Nurses should incorporate interventions for symptoms that impact sleep quality. These findings suggest that sleep hygiene education should be a part of routine clinical care. Conclusion: Adults with MS experience the burden of many symptoms that impact sleep quality. Interventions that include education to improve symptoms, sleep hygiene behaviors, and sleep quality are needed. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system (CNS) disease leading to inflammation and demyelination of the brain and spinal cord. This debilitating neurological disorder affects an estimated 2.3 million adults worldwide and is the leading cause of loss of work and disability among young adults. 1,2 In addition to the neurological disease, MS is associated with several symptoms including disordered sleep that impacts overall well-being and quality of life (QOL). Signs and symptoms of MS depend on the location of the CNS affected; however, fatigue is themost common symptom of MS. Fatigue in MS4 can be caused either by the disease itself or as a result of other symptoms such as anxiety, depression, disordered sleep, or various medication regimens. Approximately 60% to 90% of people with MS complain of fatigue, and there is evidence that disordered sleep and depression are contributing factors. 5,6 It has been suggested that MS-related fatigue is both primary and secondary, with disordered sleep worsening fatigue by overstimulating the CNS. The etiology remains uncertain, but extreme triggering of the CNS may cause disruption in circadian rhythm leading to increase in fatigue severity. Fatigue leads to decreased QOL by impeding activities of daily living and reducing psychological well-being and ability to work. Fatigue in adults with MS can be affected by not only poor sleep quality but also anxiety and depression, which are also common. 7–9 In fact, anxiety can occur in approximately 30% of people with MS. 9 The stressors of the MS diagnosis can impact people because of the cumbersome disease sequelae, such as unpredictable relapses, complicated medication regimes, and multiple psychosocial issues.10 People with MS struggle daily with a multitude of symptoms, including pain, fatigue, cognitive issues, depression, and anxiety. Poor sleep hygiene is a set of behaviors that influence sleep quality (ie, watching television [TV], uncomfortable nighttime ambient temperature, and exciting presleep activities). These behaviors have been found to be more prevalent among poor sleepers. 12 There is some evidence of a relationship between fatigue and sleep qualityamong adults with MS. A few studies have suggested that sleep quality is connected to increased disability 13 and cognitive decline (sustained working memory) 14 and global cognitive performance, which can decrease QOL and theability to conduct work-related tasks. Fatigue and disordered sleep are a public health problem, and existing studies and education are lacking for those with MS. To our knowledge, no one has explored the relationship among fatigue, MS symptoms, and sleep hygiene behaviors. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among anxiety, difficulty concentrating, sleep hygiene behaviors, and sleep quality in adults with MS who self-report fatigue. The survey questions were developed to be completed by the participants in their desired setting (home, library) via computer, tablet, or other mobile devices with phone assistance available, if needed, from the primary investigator or research assistant. A computer programmer collaborated with the research team to develop the questionnaire within REDCap, a secured web environment. Next, interviews were conducted with 5 participants to ask for input on diary questions for the final version to be sent to a target of 30 participants with MS. Each subject received a web link through text message for detailed instructions and questions via REDCap. We recruited a convenience sample of community-dwelling adults from MS clinics in the midwestern United States during routine clinic appointments and from a local MS society's listserv. The inclusion criteria were a definitive diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS or secondary progressive MS, age of 18 to 70 years, willingness to write about symptoms and lifestyle habits in a web-based diary format, reliable computer and Internet access, and ability to read and speak English. We obtained the university's institutional review board approval. Written consent was obtained from all participants during a private face-to-face clinic visit once all questions were answered, and participants were assured of confidentiality and ability to withdraw at any time without consequence. After consent, participants who volunteered for the study completed a demographic form and were instructed how to use REDCap and provided instructions on completion of the web-based diary. Participants were asked to log into REDCap once a day for 7 consecutive days to answer narrative questions in the electronic diary regarding symptoms that positively or negatively impacted sleep and lifestyle habits. After 4 weeks, the subject was asked to repeat the survey for 7 more days. Data were collected for 7 consecutive days; however, because the primary aim was to examine feasibility of the data collection method, 4 days of electronic diary data were accepted as full participation in this study. Self-reported demographic information was obtained included age, race, sex, education, marital status, and disease-modifying therapy use (yes/no). Disease-modifying therapy use was validated through review of medical records. MS Related Symptom Scale (Revised). We obtained symptoms experienced using a revised version of the MS Related Symptom Scale, 16 with additional items generated from focus group data,5 and a single open-ended question to gather recent co-occurring symptoms(total, 37 items). Symptom frequency was reported on a 6-point scale from 0 (never) to 5 (always), with a total score ranging from 0 to 180 (higher score = higher frequency). The test-retest reliability was excellent at 0.89 .2,5. Expanded Disability Status Scale: Patient Version. The patient self-report version of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) provided an estimate of disability status. 17 The scale is composed of 17 items that mirror the physician-administered EDSS and has been found to be highly reliable with Cronbach's alpha of 0.92. Summing the scores provides a possible range of 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to MS). Sleep Quality (Single-Item Scale). All participants rated the previous night's sleep quality every morning on a visual analog scale from 1 to 10 (extremely poor to extremely good). Test-retest reliability coefficients of the Sleep Quality visual analog scale have been found to range from 0.91 to 0.90. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 19 to assess self-reported sleep quality. The PSQI includes 19 items creating 7 dimensions of sleep quality (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, the use of sleep-promoting medication, and daytime dysfunction). Each dimension was scored using a scale of 0 (not during the past month) to 3 (3 or more times per week) with a global sum of 5 or greater indicating poor sleep quality. Cronbach's α is .83 for its 7 components. 19 The instrument takes approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete. Sleep Behavior Self-Rating Scale. Participants rated during an average week how often they did certain behaviors around bedtime from never to very often. 20 Behaviors included watching TV, listening to the radio, reading, smoking, talking to someone, and eating or drinking. The instrument has a high test-retest reliability (r = 0.88) and internal consistency (Cronbach's α of .76). Descriptive statistics for continuous variables (mean, median, range, and standard deviation) were obtained for thesample. Frequency was tabulated for categorical variables. Symptom variables were computed using ordinal scale. The outcome variables were PSQI total scores, and the demographic variables were age and sex. Modeling was performed using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS. All analyses were 2-sided with a significance level of .05. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4. Characteristics of the Participants. The sample was composed of 39 participants with MS. Demographic and related clinical data are shown in Table 1. Most participants were female (85%) and white (81%). The subtype of MS was mainly relapsing-remitting MS (81%) with a mean (SD) time since diagnosis of 11.3 (7.5) years, and the mean (SD) EDSS (self-report version) was 3.8 (1.7), suggesting a lower level of disability (Table 1). Correlations did not reveal differences in age, education, length since diagnosis, MS relapse, disability status, or sleep variables from the PSQI. The frequencies of forgetfulness, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating were significantly correlated with sleep quality. Separate components of the PSQI were examined as predictors of sleep, in which 3 symptoms (forgetfulness, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating) were statistically significant predictors (P < .5). The remaining components were not associated with sleep (fatigue [P = .05], pain [P = .10], and heat intolerance [P = .25]). In contrast, fatigue, pain, and heat intolerance frequencies were not associated with sleep quality on the PSQI. Sleep behaviors including watching TV, talking on the phone, and listening to the radio significantly correlated with frequent reports of fatigue, forgetfulness, anxiety, and pain. In addition, watching TV and listening to the radio, but not talking on the phone, were significant for frequent reports of difficulty concentrating. Notably, talking on thephone was significantly associated with heat intolerance (Table 2). For the symptoms and demographic variables, there were significant differences for fatigue frequency and sex (P < .007). This article investigated self-report fatigue frequency and other symptoms with sleep quality and sleep hygiene behaviors in adults with MS. Our findings indicated that MS symptoms, including fatigue, are related to poor sleep hygiene behaviors, which corresponds with existing studies that indicate fatigue and poor sleep occur in more than 80% of the patients with MS. 3,21 This is a concern because fatigue and poor sleep often cluster with a cycle of depression, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating. 5,22 We found that psychological problems, including forgetfulness, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating, are also correlated with sleep quality. Our findings are significant for corroborating existing studies on the high prevalence of sleep problems among patients with MS. Furthermore, our findings signal the cascading of psychological problems and a need for mental health screening and intervention, especially when patients with MS present with sleep difficulties. Forgetfulness, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating were symptoms that correlated with sleep quality. Previous studies found that anxiety and poor sleep demonstrated a strong relationship to overall worry about health. 23,24 Reduced sleep quality is a severe problem for patients with MS and could negatively impact the patients' overall health. Furthermore, cognitive impairment and altered moods can manifest in those with difficulty sleeping. 13 Depression and anxiety are both considered mood disorders, often overlapping. Excessive worry, indicative of an anxiety spectrum disorder, is not only related to impaired health, but this relationship is bidirectional. 23 Moreover, fatigue, anxiety, poor sleep quality, and, ultimately, sleep hygiene behaviors may factor into this problem. It is unclear why these symptoms cluster together. Inconsistent with others, 2,21 pain was not significantly related with poor sleep quality. It may be that pain was underreported because of the severity of fatigue and other symptoms. It was not possible, however, to glean from this study because of lack of causation and the use of the revised version of the MS Related Symptom Scale, because it has only 1 item for pain frequency. Our findings suggest a need for further exploration and development of how symptoms are related, which would ultimately impact the lives of adults living with MS. Because fatiguefrequency and sleep quality are subjective symptoms, the 2 symptoms are better assessed as separate concepts. This study found that use of technology was related to sleep quality. These findings support the National Sleep Foundation's 25 recommendation to remove electronic devices, such as TV and phones, from the bedroom and restrict use during the hour before bedtime. 26 The use of technology before bedtime has been found to be associated with increased mood disturbances. 27 However, there has been little research on adults and, to our knowledge, none on adults with MS. There is some evidence suggesting that the combined use of mobile and computer use is associated with perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and sleep disturbances among college-aged adults. 28 Future studies should examine the underlying relationships between evening electronic device use, stress, sleep, and depression among adults. It is important to acknowledge the small sample size. In addition, because of the descriptive study design, it is not possible to establish causality, for example, between symptom pathology (eg, difficulty concentrating) and sleep quality. Thus, study results might not represent populations with greater odds of poor sleep quality due to increased disability. These results should be interrupted judiciously because of self-report of symptom frequency and sleep quality. Although both the MS-RS and the PSQI are well-validated tools for measuring symptoms and sleep quality, individual symptoms of anxiety and depression were not initially assessed for clinical depression or anxiety. Future studies may benefit from inclusion of well-validated tools recommended by the American Academy of Neurology (eg, Patient Health Questionnaire-9/Neuro QOL for depression and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety) 29 to establish a baseline and tease out subjective perceptions of the adults with MS. Nursing Implications and Future Directions. Our findings suggest that interventions aimed to improve sleep hygiene may also reduce anxiety, fatigue, and forgetfulness, which are common MS symptoms. Other interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, ought to be considered. At a minimum, these findings stress a need for comprehensive screening and assessment of multiple symptoms at each encounter such as a criterion standard fatigue assessment, with those of anxiety, sleep quality, or forgetfulness. 29,30 Nurses caring for patients with MS should educate them about successful coping skills and strategies with fatigue and sleep, especially for those who are prone to anxiety and worry. Future studies would be strengthened by using a combination of self-report and objective measures of sleep (eg, polysomnography, wrist actigraphy) in a larger sample of patients with MS. This study examined the relationship among fatigue, symptoms, sleep hygiene, and sleep quality in adults with MS. The findings suggest that several symptoms are still in need of assessment and screening to support improved sleep quality among adults with MS. In addition, education is needed on sleep hygiene measures to improve overall sleep. Future investigations of symptoms and sleep are needed, especially randomized efforts aimed at improving anxiety and depression and supporting sleep quality.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531443310676090/Is-anyone-familiar-with-a-Burst-Neuorstimulator	"Originally Posted by Marco. I have both a medtronic pump and spinal cord stimulator (SCS). The pump is located lower left abdomen and SCS in my right lower back. I never had a problem with the two - they don't even know each other are there. The SCS needs to be reprogrammed from time to time to maximize the benefits. Ensure you are getting the MRI-compatible equipment and know there are differences between what MRIs are allowed. I'm not sure what the new SCS mri limitations are, but the device is a TON better than the old models. Fully charge in 1 hour (vs 8 hours/week), manageable via tablet ... yes, I wish I had that. The only problem is manufacturing delays are rampant because Puerto Rico got nailed with the hurricane. I did have a mandatory psych eval for the SCS, but not for the pump. I have no idea why the two were handled differently. Hi Marco,. Thanks for the info. Glad to hear that they're compatible from someone who actually had the two units at the same time. I'm sure Brad appreciates the information also. I've been told about the psyche evaluation too, and I thought the same thing... I've been walking around with an implanted. device for 7 years and it's the size of a hockey puck, so why are they worried about a little battery pack being implanted in my rump. The explanation I heard on a tape was the psyche eval is necessary because they want to make sure you'll be okay with knowing you have a device implanted. And once again I went ""huh."" Oh well, we do what we have to. I'm in a bit of a conundrum because in the last couple years I've developed neuromuscular scoliosis, and it's decided to steadily degenerate. Up until a few years ago my lower back x-ray just fine. Then I started leaning, and they did a scoliosis X-ray, and the curve was 40 degrees... but from what I read scoliosis degenerates about a degree per year. So the leaning continued and the next x-ray, less than a year later, showed the curve was a 55 degrees, and the next x-ray taken just a couple months down the road and it ws at 65. The neurosurgeon says I have to decide now if I'll have the surgery, but with the MS, and my age, there is no way I could rehab from the surgery. The neurosurgeons tell me it's a grueling surgery, well 2 surgeries. One 8 hour, then a couple days later a 10 hour. My reality after watching rehab videos and realizing what it takes to rehab correctly, my MS doesn't allow me to move in the manner that's needed for rehab. So we're saying no to the scoliosis surgery. (If you're interested, just google scoliosis surgery and click on images...it looks as bad as they say it is.). And that's where the neurostimulator comes in. Since the curve will continue to degenerate, the pain may get worse, and we're looking for something other than meds for the pain. I'll probably end up with a wheelchair, fitted for the scoliosis, and a head piece that will keep my head from flopping. I've had the shots, but there evidently isn't any other space left to do an epidural in my lumbar spine. If I don't get the chair, I figure I can walk with a mirror held so I can see where I'm going. Thanks again for the info Marco. How's your pump been working for you?"																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531517059710938/MS-Ireland-::	"The Hardest Thing. Thursday June 07 2018 11:30 AM. Next week, 11 th to the 17 th June, is Carer's Week in Ireland. We're delighted to have Guest Blogger Gemma Donnelly Cox writing about being a Carer and how she balances life in the ‘here and now' while also planning for the future. Caring, for me, is about enabling and empowering my husband to live the life of his choosing to his highest potential. Simple, eh? I'm not so sure. Over and over again, I am torn between goals that, at times, conflict. And I'll bet this happens to every carer; maybe not the same goals but tension nevertheless. Currently, the ones that preoccupy me have to do with timing and with attitude. When I say timing, I mean whether to focus on the present or the future. A whole lot of enabling and empowering is about making the most of every day; doing today's work today. Right now, I'm typing this blog and Alexis, my husband, who is quadriplegic with progressive MS, is using voice control software to work on his computer. Our son has just left the house to go bouldering at the climbing gym up the road. We are all enjoying the here and now this afternoon. Much of the time, however, I feel as though my focus is planning for the future, leaving little room for the present. So much thought goes into what I know lies ahead and also to planning for the unknowns. What if Alexis' voice starts to weaken further and he can't use voice control software? Should he be using eye control now, just in case? But what if his eyesight starts to fail? Worries about the future can rob you of ‘the now' as you flail around trying to prepare for what might emerge. But if you only stay in ‘the now', you could very well end up not being ready when one of these MS issues suddenly rears its head. Right up there with timing is attitude. It seems to me that so much of what is joyous in life is about knowing when things are good, celebrating them and being grateful for them. Like right now blogging about how it feels to be a carer. A lot of the time, however, gratitude for the good things can be in tension with putting mental energy into staying vigilant and being ready to advocate. For example, Alexis was recently invited to a dinner with people who know a lot about MS. I was looking forward to going with him and slacked up on my usual advocacy of making his requirements clear to the hosts. I figured that people in the know would get it right. Wrong . The hosts invited a quadriplegic guest seated in a large wheelchair to a venue where the tables were way too low for his chair. The path to the (too small) space at a table- in the middle of a room, full of seated diners- was impossibly narrow. It does not have to be like that folks! It's hard to be grateful for a nice night out when your husband can't reach the table and your advocating would have made it different. When I feel I'm getting the balance right managing the tension between timing and attitude, I am far happier and more confident in my Carer role. But before I sign off, I'd like to add one more tension, the one that can arise between caring and self-care. During Carer's Week, we're reminded that Superwomen and Supermen stay sharper when they take care of themselves. I was reminded of this back in the autumn when I was away for the weekend by myself (a super duper self-care step) and I came across a young couple in their 20s. The carer in the partnership was a real Wonder Woman. But she was wrecked tired, more tired than I remember being at her age and stage. I had time on my hands and tried to help out. She knew I was up to the job but she simply couldn't let herself stop. Carers, none of us last forever but if you want to be in for the long haul and really make a difference for your loved one, you've got to take care of yourself too. For many carers, I guess that's the hardest thing. Gemma and Alexis Donnelly live in Dublin with their son Finn and Labrador Retriever, Elmo. In 2016, Alexis joined the Scientific Steering Committee of the Progressive MS Alliance. His carers have supported him to fulfil his role in the Alliance. For more on the Progressive MS Alliance and the exceptional work that it does in pursuit of its aim to understand and overcome some of the biggest barriers to treatment development for progressive MS, see.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531459591356331/MS-Ireland--::-Helping-Everyone-Affected-by-Multiple-Sclerosis	"MS Ireland  ::. Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Wednesday May 30 2018 05:45 PM. ‘Making Ireland the Best Place to do Multiple Sclerosis Research’ Report Sets Out Next Steps for the Improved Access to Treatments and Novel Therapeutics. To mark World MS Day on 30 May 2018, MS Ireland, supported by Novartis, will launch a new report which is intended to help create an MS research landscape that will put Ireland at the forefront of MS research, innovation and therapeutic application.[i] The report aims to support researchers and provide people with MS and the public with a better understanding of the research process and ongoing research. Some of the recommendations include the establishment of an MS Research Community, improved data and information sharing, greater involvement of people living with MS, potential funding models, and improved dissemination of research findings. The community will help overcome obstacles to research such as gathering samples, establishing a biobank and a patient register. The report defines a number of key asks as follows:. “Given the prevalence of MS here, Ireland should be leading the way in MS research. The report launched today gives us a blueprint of what needs to be done,” says Ava Battles, CEO of MS Ireland. “As a first step, we want to establish an MS research community collective to bolster Ireland’s current research strengths to obtain more funding and improve research visibility. While the top priorities in MS research are currently being addressed, this could be done better if the MS community addressed them as a collective.”. Dr Claire McCoy, RCSI, said, “Research offers people living with MS real hope for improvement both in their treatment but also in their quality of life. I am delighted to support MS Ireland in speaking at their public meeting that will help bring people up to date with progress that is being made. The report also lays out a clear pathway that will help to overcome some of the issues that have been faced and I would urge people working in the treatment of MS to get involved as the recommendations are rolled out.”. Commenting on the launch of the report, Loretto Callaghan, General Manager & Country President, Novartis Ireland said, “We are committed to working with MS Ireland to help raise awareness on the importance of research. Research plays a major role in progress so understanding the barriers that exist is the first step in devising a plan that will help to overcome these issues in the future. We believe that Ireland can become a leader in MS research and look forward to collaborating further with MS Ireland to deliver the recommendations of the ‘Making Ireland the Best Place to do Multiple Sclerosis Research’ report.”. This report was compiled following a meeting with a mix of stakeholders interested in MS research in Ireland, including patients, doctors, scientists and nurses and was facilitated by Novartis Ireland in November 2017."																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295893373854306/MS-Views-and-News:	"MAY 22, 2018. Spring has sprung! As I look around, Mother Earth is in bloom. Trees are sprouting new leaves, plants are growing, and the grass is green once again. I love spring and all that it represents — hopes for new birth and rebirth. For those who are unaware, May is Mental Health Awareness Month. I write this week to encourage those who are battling and surviving mental illness and any related disorders. It serves to urge everyone to actively recognize the warning signs of someone in need of assistance. This column is a call to action to offer support, empathy, a safe environment, and to eradicate stigma. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) reports that one in five adults in the U.S. experience a mental illness, and one in 25 adults live with a serious mental illness. Mental health continues to be an issue that is under-discussed, undertreated, and often ignored. However, there are warning signs. My experiences of having MS and heart disease have introduced me to depression and anxiety. From my window seat, my eyes opened to the struggle that many people face on a daily basis. I have vowed to learn about mental health disorders, speak openly about them, share my personal experience, get acquainted with available resources , and offer encouraging words. On my journey as a heart health and MS advocate, I have met people who struggle, survive, and thrive with mental illness. I have realized that there is one commonality that we possess, which is to know that we matter. We need to know that someone cares and that they hear our voices. There is a desire to feel that we have value and the longing to feel that life, in all of its tragedy and turmoil, is really worth living. :::::::."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692885896608275493/Bringing-Us-Closer---MS-Connection	"Living with MS can sometimes feel like you’re stranded on an island by yourself. People who don’t have MS might not fully understand what you’re going through, and others living with MS may have symptoms and experiences entirely different from yours. To make the MS world smaller, this year’s World MS Day (May 30) theme is “bringing us closer.” It’s about building connections and sharing stories to unify us in our collective stand against MS. Connect with the researchers, students and nurses who are at the forefront of finding a cure to bring us closer to a world free of MS. Meet two of our researchers and learn how their work is #BringingUsCloser to a cure. Haley Titus, MD, PhD. Haley (far right) and her family. Why did Haley get involved with MS research? It all started with her mother. “My personal and professional life goal is to cure MS, as my mother has secondary progressive MS. She is the most optimistic person I know. She has taught me how to be a kind, strong and empowered woman. She taught me the value and importance of resiliency. My goal is to create a brighter future and better quality of life through my work. I feel obligated to serve because I have the privilege of being able to.”. Haley’s research focuses on the immune system and expanding ways people with MS can empower themselves. “What I work on is selectively targeting just the small part of the immune system that goes awry in MS. We are also working on the combination of selective immunoregulatory therapy and myelin repair in addition to promoting general wellness such as diet and exercise.”. Melissa Brown, PhD. Melissa was already working in the research field when MS affected her family. “When my brother was diagnosed, I was already an immunologist doing research. He was a sophomore in college when he had the first indication that something was wrong. It was a very scary time for him and our family. We knew there was no cure and that it was hard to predict how severe his disabilities would become. Luckily, I had access to published scientific information and of course was eager to learn what was known about the MS and what treatments were available to patients.”. She has hope for the future of MS research and hopes others do as well. “A diagnosis of MS is perhaps less devastating today perhaps than when my brother was first evaluated. Earlier treatment and much better drugs with fewer side effects are available for many patients that dramatically slow progression. I am very hopeful that this disease can be conquered. There are many dedicated people who are working on this problem. Importantly, there is a revolution in the technology that allows us to collect and share large amounts of genetic and cellular data from patients. With a little more time and research support, I think real changes in treatment are just over the horizon.”.

Additionally, Julie will be presenting at the MS Views and News educational program on May 29th at the Nashville Marriott Airport, as showing here . to attend this event, RSVP here . Roberts, diagnosed with MS while making her second recording in 2005, will also attend #CMSC sessions to learn more about potential and current treatments, and ongoing research in the disease. The conference runs from May 30 to June 2 in Nashville. She is set to perform at the meeting’s opening John F. Kurtzke Memorial Lecture and Luncheon on Wednesday, and again at its awards reception on Friday, June 1. Her first single, “ Break Down Here ,” was a Billboard Top 20 Hot Country Song and she has sold millions of albums. Roberts says she met her diagnosis with years of denial, refusing to pursue any treatment. “I thought if I ignored my MS it would go away,” she said in a press release . Then another disaster struck. Record-shattering rainfall flooded Nashville in early May 2010, inundating the Roberts family home and killing 26 people across Tennessee and neighboring Kentucky. Roberts and her family were rescued by boat, after frightening hours that led to an awakening. “The flood rescue made me realize that I needed to manage my MS, adopt a healthy and positive lifestyle, and show others that the disease does not define who you are or stop you from pursing your dreams,” she said. She now encourages patients to find a neurologist and healthcare team they trust and feel comfortable with to ensure the care they need. “Julie Roberts is living proof of the mission of the CMSC and its Annual Meeting – to present MS healthcare teams with the latest information and tools to provide optimum care to those living with MS,” said June Halper, chief executive officer of CMSC. “We are excited to have Julie at our conference to entertain and share her MS journey with our attendees.”. In Roberts’ latest album, “I Think You Know,” produced by Shooter Jennings, she sings about love, loss, roots, and redemption. She also has a biography, “ Beauty in the Breakdown, Choosing to Overcome ,” set for release in September. :::::::."

Thursday May 10 2018 11:00 AM. This week, in a letter to her nearest and dearest, Willeke Van Eeckhoutte puts down in words how she really feels. “What do you want me to say?”. Dearly Beloved,. What do you want me to say? What is it you don’t understand? When someone like you says, ""Well, what do you want me to say?"" during moments when I feel less than cheerful, it sounds like a rejection. Not just of me, but of your understanding of what I, and we, have been going through for the past 13 years. After all this time, all the wisdom we have gained, we could be the writers of the largest MS encyclopaedia! Instead, being asked that question sounds like a betrayal. It’s like you’re using the illness I never asked for as a slur against me. The truth is, I could write you a hundred different letters and a thousand expert explanations about my symptoms and my thoughts on all those shiny plaques on my MRI images. Nonetheless, I often think, ""How can you possibly relate to my life if you don’t have MS? But, with all its intricate, demeaning and unpredictable symptoms, how could I ever expect you to?"" The answer is, you honestly cannot know what it is to be me, and this is not my rejection of you, far from it. But, I do need to plea for your insight, patience and empathy. Just as I am struggling to find the words in this letter, MS is an ever-changing plotline that forces me to reinvent my life’s storyline as we speak. When I snap at you, I don’t mean to. More to the point, you were probably not the problem. Like when slamming a door in anger, the doorframe, the wall or the house aren’t ever reasons for the action. Sometimes I am absolutely worn out, totally exhausted because of my illness. This exhaustion feels even more pronounced when people express how they don’t understand me. I’m tired of the illness that has me acting in ways I normally wouldn’t. I carry an imperfect brain because of illness with a fickle revolving-door manifestation. It causes me to feel claustrophobic within myself. I know that keeping up with an ever-changing illness is as challenging for you as it is for me. I also know that there are times when you’d rather be somewhere else instead of being near me. What I want you to get is I don’t wallow in self-pity nor do I jump up and down in elation because I was diagnosed with this obnoxious illness. MS has impacted so many aspects of my life, it is part of what makes my life what it is today. Makes me how I am today. I sure am! Hopeful that you would understand me? What I ask for is simple but it isn’t easy. You are part of my walk through life and am glad to have you with me. When you feel exasperated by what I say or do, please step into my shoes with me for one minute and we can work out what’s really going on. Lots of love,.

Some also have episodes of vertigo. Vertigo is the false sensation of whirling or spinning of yourself or the world around you. According to one report , about 20 percent of people with MS experience vertigo. Dizziness and vertigo contribute to balance problems, which are common in people with MS. Ongoing dizziness and vertigo can interfere with daily tasks, increase the risk of falls, and can even become disabling. What vertigo feels like. Vertigo is an intense sensation of spinning, even if you’re not moving. It’s similar to what you feel on a twirling amusement park ride. The first time you experience vertigo can be very unsettling, even frightening. Vertigo may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. It can continue for hours, or even days. Sometimes, dizziness and vertigo are accompanied by vision problems, tinnitus or hearing loss, or trouble standing or walking. Causes of dizziness and vertigo in MS. The lesions that result from MS make it difficult for nerves within the central nervous system to send messages to the rest of the body. This causes MS symptoms, which vary according to the location of the lesions. A lesion or lesions in the brain stem or cerebellum, the area of the brain that controls balance, may cause vertigo. Vertigo can also be a symptom of a problem with the inner ear. Other possible causes of dizziness or vertigo include certain medications, blood vessel disease, migraine, or stroke. Your doctor can help you rule out other possible causes of vertigo.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295933612245380/Therapeutic-Inertia-in-the-New-Landscape-of-Multiple-Sclerosis-Care.	"Saposnik G, et al. Front Neurol. The landscape of multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment is constantly changing. Significant heterogeneity exists in the efficacy and risks associated with these therapies. Therefore, clinicians have the challenge to tailor treatment based on several factors (disease activity level, risk of progression, individual patient preferences and characteristics, personal expertise, etc.), to identify the optimal balance between safety and efficacy. However, most clinicians have limited education in decision-making and formal training in risk management. Together, these factors may lead to therapeutic inertia (TI); defined as the absence of treatment initiation or intensification when therapeutic goals are unmet. TI may lead to suboptimal treatments choices, worse clinical outcomes, and more disability. This article provides a succinct overview on factors influencing TI in MS care.

Friday May 04 2018 08:00 AM. This week Mary Deveraux shares with us her experience of Primary Progressive MS. Akin to the big stories we’re all familiar with, PPMS brings unexpected twists to life no-one ever expects. Living with Primary Progressive MS is like starting a new book, with a difference. Each and every page you turn brings an unexpected ‘twist in the tale’. As the days add up, I realise my experience is like an epic story akin to the Iliad. It consumes my life and the lives of all that surrounds me as we grapple with the unexpected (far too regularly). The motto changed in my home from “will we” to “if your up to it” . Once there was a name put on it, Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) it was as though the floodgates opened. Every sort of symptom came in my door, wrapped around and in me and never left my body. The PPMS brings new ones with it too. From incredible pain to mind blowing fatigue that makes me want to become one with the sofa! PPMS is exhausting and the mental strain that makes it even more so. The forgetfullness, the difficulty in making decisions, the doubting myself and a pervading send of fear of doing something wrong that would effect others and making mistakes. In my line of work I couldn't afford mistakes. I would never have forgiven myself. After a difficult six years of traumatic change, I stopped running away from my illness. I am learning to accept that the work that I had dedicated my life to had to go. Then there was the personal guilt and shame of letting THAT go. Because of my symptoms, I failed an off-the-road test and my driving licence was taken away. Accepting all these changes is hard. Readers would know from my previous piece that I was always ‘The Fixer’. Now I can’t fix myself. Yet, as time is going on I am learning that I can help myself. I have had to get out and make new friends and do things at 50 I never thought I would be doing. I accept all the help that’s offered with the grace and kindness with which it is offered. I now need a cane to walk and know I might need a mobility scooter on holidays to make sure I make the most of my holiday time. That’s okay. These changes (the cane, the mobility scooter, asking for help, being open about my vulnerability) don’t come easy nor over night. But this process of asking for help and accepting it absolutely is making my life easier and this transition more tolerable. Living with Primary Progressive MS is never going to be easy for me; it doesn’t give me a break or a holiday. It has broken my heart. But as I accept the changes, that I have more limitations, I still pick up my book. Each day I get to turn the pages and through all the heartache, I’m determined to find the hero and the great things in my story. Today, may we all remember WE ARE the heroes in our story."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295892102038429/MS-Views-and-News:	"30th April 2018. The new guideline aims to help clinicians choose among as many as two dozen potential therapies which, it is hoped, will delay disease progression, and help more patients avoid fearsome consequences like severe disability and reduce life expectancy. But doctors also face the challenge of limited follow-up for many of these drugs, one of which was recently voluntarily removed from the market due to side effects. A new practice guideline published by the American Academy of Neurology on April 23 attempted to sort out recommendations among an explosion of drugs for multiple sclerosis which are considered to be disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) which have been approved in recent years. The guideline, which discussed clinical questions such as choice of therapies, as well as strategies including switching or stopping DMTs, was published during the Academy’s annual meeting in Los Angeles. The guideline discussed 17 FDA-approved medications, and also made a weak recommendation regarding off-label use of six other drugs. (Patients may also have to take other drugs to treat their symptoms, which DMTs are not intended to address). The cornucopia of new medications, at least seven of which have only been approved since 2010, has its origin in immune strategies. “If you trace it back to the very first FDA-approved medicine, interferon in 1993, the scientists knew MS had something to do with the immune system,” said Alexander Rae-Grant, MD, professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, and lead author on the article. Another older drug, glatiramer acetate, was approved in 1996. “It is like a molecular mimic; it confuses the immune system into attacking the medicine, because it looks like myelin,” the substance that surrounds nerve cells, said Rae-Grant. “We know everything there is to know about that medicine. “Since then, we’ve become much more targeted in our approach, and we’ve adapted some medications used in cancer populations, as well as rheumatology,” he added. Head-to-Head Clinical Trials Urgently Needed. But much less is known about some of the newer medications, leading the members of the guideline committee to make recommendations about the need for clinical trials in areas like comparative effectiveness and pregnancy-related issues. And prior to just last year, with the approval of ocrelizumab, there was no DMT for the primary progressive form of MS. (A classification system for several varieties of MS was revised in 2016). The uncertainty some clinicians may experience is illustrated by the voluntary withdrawal from the market of one drug, daclizumab, which was initially referred to in the guideline, according to Rae-Grant (daclizumab was first approved in 1997 for transplant patients). Neurologists are hopeful that the new therapies will be life-changing for some patients. Perhaps the most feared consequences of MS are severe disability and a somewhat reduced life expectancy. “It used to be that about half of the patients would not be able to walk independently after about 25 years. But we don’t have a lot of long-term data on the MS population,” noted Rae-Grant. “If we go back to earliest therapies, some cohorts have been followed for 20 years. But some of the new DMTs have only been available for two-to-five years, and disease progression is typically measured by relapses which occur over two to three years,” explained Ruth Ann Marrie, MD, PhD, professor at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, and co-author on the article. “So it’s difficult to say what a new therapy is going to do for somebody 20 years from now.”. But neurologists are hopeful that patients will experience some long-term benefits, including a delay of progression. In determining how to do that, the experts debated questions like whether to prescribe the strongest therapies first, or to switch to them if less potent drugs stop working.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295942215940341/MS-Views-and-News:	"April 23, 2018. · Four years of continuous treatment with OCREVUS showed a sustained reduction in underlying disease activity in relapsing MS (RMS) in analysis from the open-label extension period. · Additional analyses show OCREVUS delayed cognitive decline and improved cognitive function in RMS, as measured by Symbol Digit Modalities Test. · OCREVUS reduced the presence of nerve damage and inflammation biomarkers in people with RMS shown in interim data from a Phase III study. · New safety data are consistent with OCREVUS’ favorable benefit-risk profile for both RMS and primary progressive MS. · Over 40,000 patients treated with OCREVUS globally. SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – April 23, 2018 – Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), announced today that new OCREVUS (ocrelizumab) data were presented at the 70 th American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting from April 21-27 in Los Angeles, California. The data showcase the efficacy of OCREVUS in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) through several measures of underlying disease activity and disability progression, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cognitive function, and spinal fluid biomarkers of inflammation and neurodegeneration. New safety data remain consistent with OCREVUS’ favorable benefit-risk profile in both relapsing and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). “The OCREVUS data shared at AAN show the impact of this targeted B cell therapy on slowing disability progression in MS, and further support the approach of early treatment. In the extension studies, patients who received OCREVUS continuously experienced less disease progression than those who began treatment at a later time point,” said Stephen Hauser, M.D., chair of the Scientific Steering Committee of the OPERA studies, director of the Weill Institute for Neurosciences and chair of the Department of Neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. “It is encouraging that with up to four years of data, we continue to see a robust effect and a consistent safety profile.”. After four years of continuous treatment, the benefits of OCREVUS in reducing underlying disease activity in RMS were sustained, as shown in a platform presentation measuring brain MRI activity through the randomized and open-label extension (OLE) periods of the Phase III studies. Patients who stayed on OCREVUS maintained low numbers of T1 gadolinium-enhancing (T1Gd+) lesions (0.017 pre-OLE to 0.17 T1Gd+ lesions per scan at year four [year two of the OLE phase]) and new/enlarging T2 (N/ET2) lesions [0.052 pre-OLE to 0.080 N/ET2 lesions per scan] through year two of the OLE phase. Patients who switched from Rebif ® (interferon beta-1a) to OCREVUS at the start of the OLE period had a near-complete silencing of T1Gd+ lesions per scan at one and two years (0.476 pre-OLE to 0.007 and 0.004 T1Gd+ lesions per scan), as well as an 85 and 97 percent decrease in N/ET2 lesions per scan at years one and two, respectively (2.159 pre-OLE to 0.333 and 0.063 N/ET2 lesions per scan). :::::::."																																																																																							
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692885904397054972/It's-Time---MS-Connection	"Have you ever had a moment where you realize, “it’s time?” Time to make a change and let go of the past? When I was 10 years old, I had my first job delivering newspapers. I woke up before 5 a.m., traversed through our dark neighborhood in hot, cold, rain and even snow, bringing that morning’s The Washington Post to customers doorsteps. It was my first taste of “working.” It certainly wasn’t easy, but I loved it. In fact, I still have a plaque from the Post in my home office that commends my “outstanding performance during the blizzards of 1987.”. Yes, we even had to deliver those papers during a blizzard! Working was my comfort zone; it’s where I thrived. From paperboy to various jobs at a dry cleaner, local Chinese restaurant or Blockbuster video, I loved it all--the atmosphere, working with others, even collaborating with some of the owners. I genuinely enjoyed it. Once I got to college, a then young, growing financial company called Capital One hired me in June 1998, and my professional career officially began. And what a ride it was. It included meeting my future wife, working at two prominent Fortune 200 companies, a move to Texas, graduate school and even starting a family. I started as a tax accountant and ended as a director of product management. After being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, I wanted to continue to work, even as I was receiving monthly infusion for my MS. My former manager told me that “Mike Wentink at 75 percent is better than most,” and I wanted to prove him right. I had visions of pioneering the 21st century remote executive, living with a chronic disease, but still performing at a high level. Unfortunately, after 20 years of working, I couldn’t sustain the energy required for an entire day, and relapses were becoming common. So, just over six years ago, I medically retired from the professional workforce. Although I don’t look back with sadness, there is a certain emptiness. Work was a large part of who I was. My identity. My wife and I met at my first job, so working always holds a special place in my heart. And I’ll always cherish how she’d look at me, her eyes beaming with pride after some of my career achievements. My car, purchased new in 2009 to celebrate my new position as product manager, sits mostly idle at home, nine years later, with barely 23k miles on it. And my closet is filled with a work wardrobe that’s gathering dust. I guess I should say, was filled with work clothes. Earlier this year, I realized it was time . I’ve made peace with having MS. I’m no longer chasing the ghosts of who I was; rather, I want to embrace who I’ve become and can still be. The clothes had to go. Taking that step wasn’t easy, but you know what? It felt good. Each new day is another opportunity to re-define who you are and to become a new or better person. I’m still “working,” just not how I used to be. Managing a chronic disease like MS is a full-time job. However, in the absence of my professional career, I’ve discovered and developed many other aspects of my life. I write and podcast about living with MS. It’s not easy, but I love doing it. I provide my wife support and career advice, and the children call me “Teacher Daddy” because I’m always there to help them with homework or study for a test. And whenever I find enough energy, I love to bring smiles to my family’s tummies with my baking. I’ll always have my career memories, from paperboy to product manager… but now I look forward to forging new paths and experiences. And the best part is, no slacks or stuffy buttons down shirts are required."

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295989152473401/MS-Views-and-News:	"Reprint - 04.19.18. By Laurie Loscocco. June 12, 2017. For patients with complex and chronic medical conditions, knowledge is power. Without checks and balances, it also can be risky. Physicians who treat patients with multiple sclerosis say the internet in particular provides a wealth of information, both good and bad. For patients seeking to learn more, Google can lead to websites and social-media platforms serving a steady diet of information about diagnosis, treatment and management of their disease. While physicians welcome patient interest and knowledge, they also caution that not all websites are created equal and not all information found on the internet is valid. “You don't need to be a highly trained neuroimmunologist with multiple years of education to write something for the internet,” notes Aaron Boster, MD, director of the MS center at OhioHealth. In general, physicians say they don't discourage patients from seeking information online, as long as they bring what they find to their healthcare professionals. When patients come to Boster with questions about things they've read on websites or online forums, “I see a patient who is engaged, who wants to be educated and involved in their care.”. So does Timothy Shephard, MD, vice president of neurosciences at Mount Carmel Health System. “The better informed a patient is coming into an appointment, the better that appointment is going to be. I have yet to meet a physician who doesn't welcome a patient who has done research and is well-informed,” he says. Tech-Savvy Patients. Because the average age of onset for MS is 30, many patients “are people who have grown up with an iPad in their hands,” Boster says. “These are millennials who are extremely comfortable with and savvy about the internet and social media.”. When seeking information about MS, physicians say this: Consider the source. Especially in the first couple of years following a diagnosis, Boster advises patients to steer clear of the internet when it comes to MS advice. “It takes about two years for a patient to be comfortable in their own skin with their disease. They need to develop filters to evaluate what they read online. Until they do, their care team is that filter.”. Early in the course of their disease, “reading too much is guaranteed to make you frustrated,” says Boster, who also serves as OhioHealth's system medical chief of neuroimmunology. Realizing, however, that patients won't be able to resist the temptation, he urges them to “read with profound caution.”. Boster and others say it's crucial for patients to bring everything and anything they read online to their physicians so they can separate fact from fiction. Physicians say it's their job to temper expectations and provide reliable information. Boster has even initiated campaigns across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to dispense “digestible amounts of information” about the newest developments in MS. Relying on the internet to diagnose and plan for multiple sclerosis is tricky because the disease manifests itself differently in each patient. MS lesions can occur anywhere in the central nervous system, and symptoms can mimic other conditions, says Michael Racke, MD, a neurologist at OSU. For example, if the disease affects the optic nerve, loss of vision may result. If it happens in an older person, one might attribute that to normal aging. In a younger person, “We might be more inclined to think MS,” he says. Because the disease represents a unique interface between the nervous system and the immune system, it's nearly impossible to predict how it will evolve from person to person, Boster says. Twins can have the same disease yet experience it differently, he explains. Due to this variability, “You can read something from a reputable source, and it still might not apply to your particular disease.”. Online Communities. By its nature, MS can feel like a “lonely” disease, Boster says. Some of its symptoms, such as pathologic fatigue, aren't obvious or observable. Because of its relapsing/remitting characteristics, patients might seem well one month and debilitated the next. That can cause problems in the workplace, where employers might mistakenly believe employees are shirking responsibility or malingering. The Multiple Sclerosis Society of America has created visual models of the relapsing/remitting nature of multiple sclerosis to help employers understand what's happening. When dealing with workplace challenges and other issues, patient forums are another online source of support and information. “Especially for the newly diagnosed, they can be helpful,” Shephard says. “Forums can be a good source of really creative ideas from people who've gone before you.” They can offer guidance, for instance, on the best places to shop to avoid fatigue, how to deal with summer heat, how to adapt a house for wheelchair access. Because a significant number of MS patients have difficulty with cognitive processing at some point during the course of the disease, the forums can provide answers on how they and their caregivers deal with the situation, Shephard says. Boster says forums serve their best purpose by providing a safe place for patients to share with one other. “There is a sense of acceptance, understanding and community that is invaluable.”. They also can be confusing because of the volume of opinions expressed. Boster cautions that online platforms can be “the bathroom wall of comments,” with little accountability or ownership. Too Good to Be True? Those caring for people with multiple sclerosis feel perhaps most uneasy about the internet when it's used to promote unproven,potentially dangerous treatments. In the past few years, for-profit stem-cell clinics have proliferated in the United States and abroad. Their websites do not go unnoticed by patients, some of whom are willing to try anything. “In the last 12 months, I've had so many patients ask me, ‘What about these stem cells?'” Boster says. Although stem-cell therapy is not approved by the US Food & Drug Administration to treat MS, the clinics claim it provides relief from the disease. Some sites feature video testimonials from patients who say their lives have been transformed. “It looks pretty impressive,” Racke says. “But are patients putting themselves at risk and undergoing procedures that aren't medically necessary?”. He understands their frustration. “Patients who are desperate may be looking for something that is too good to be true. There may be a little too much enthusiasm for untested, unproven treatments.”. Such direct-to-consumer appeals by people promising miracles are “quackery,” Boster says. “It's predatory behavior that is abominable. It's selling false hope, and it's taking advantage of people who are very vulnerable.”. Shephard says patients in the secondary progressive stages of MS are most at risk for seeking cures at any cost. “The best you can do is educate them on the potential risks of alternative therapies and explain why FDA approval is so important. But at the end of the day, it's the patient's right to do what they feel they need to do,” he says. “Healthcare is not about forcing people to do something. It's about advising patients to make the best decision possible.”. Laurie Loscocco is a freelance writer. MS Views and News is MAKING an IMPACT on those affected by Multiple Sclerosis.

"medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702046762208871178/My-mom-has-MS,-and-now-I-do-too---Blog---MS-Society-of-Canada"	"Guest post by Sarah Flohr, MS Walk ambassador. My mom was diagnosed with MS in 2000 and I’ve watched it gradually progress over time. She needed a cane, then a walker, a wheelchair, and now she’s living in a long-term care facility. I had seen through the eyes of a caregiver for my mom for years. Then, four years ago, my vision went blurry and I started having trouble seeing anything at all. I would soon have to hear the words, just like my mom once did, “you have multiple sclerosis.”. My mom’s symptoms started around 1995. She wasn’t sure what was causing them and neither were the doctors. She had symptoms with her back and was experiencing pain throughout her body. It took a really long time for them to figure out what was going on. Once it progressed to the point where my mom needed to be in a care facility, I decided that I wanted to be there for her as much as I could. My dad and I visit her every single day. My dad goes in the morning to spend time with her and help with her meals, and I’ll go in the evening and help her do simple things like drinking or even changing the channel on the TV. That’s been a big part of our lives, helping her with those day-to-day tasks. There’s a struggle there between taking care of her and taking care of myself. I work everyday and my job is quite busy, so finding a balance is challenging, especially now that I’m also living with MS. I really didn’t see my diagnosis coming – I wasn’t prepared. One day, everything I saw just became blurry. I thought I might need new glasses, so I made an appointment with my eye doctor. They recommended that I see family doctor as soon as possible. My family doctor was concerned with my symptoms and urgently sent me to a neurologist. I had an MRI done and was diagnosed with MS shortly after. Even though my MS is different than my mom’s, I get worried that mine might develop into a more aggressive form like hers. Seeing it have such an impact on my mom everyday is extremely concerning, but I try to remind myself that everybody’s MS journey is different. My mom is in a care facility, although that’s not necessarily where my journey of the disease will take me. It’s essential for me to remind myself of that everyday. The sad reality is that you don’t really know when or how your disease will progress. Some days, I stress about my future and how my physical or mental capabilities will be affected. Most days, I feel optimistic about my future because I’m confident we will increase access to therapies and resources that will help improve our lives, and eventually find a cure. As a young woman, who is impacted directly by MS and also a caregiver to someone living with MS, I think it’s important to use my voice and provide my unique perspective. I can see and feel firsthand how MS affects everyone, not just those who are diagnosed. I also think it is extremely important to raise awareness and to meet individuals that are impacted by MS. One of the biggest ways I do that is through MS Walk and that’s why I help organize it. Not only do I love how the event raises an incredible amount of much needed awareness, but it’s really inspiring to see the entire community of people who show up. Even though we are there for so many different reasons or people, we are there for a common goal. We all want to fund MS research and fight for a cure. I’m confident we can get there. Sarah is our Atlantic MS Walk ambassador and resides in Charlottetown, PEI. As a caregiver for her mom and person living with MS, she has a deep understanding of the impact MS can have.

The ancient practice of yoga has long been touted as a wellness modality. Yoga loosely translates to “ union ,” or the yoke connecting one to God, and can be traced back 5,000 years to the Indus-Sarasvati region in Northern India. For centuries yoga was practiced as medicine and as a spiritual path. Modern medicine is catching up. On more than one occasion yoga has been clinically proven to provide healthy results. An increasing amount of clinical studies focus on yoga as it specifically benefits those with multiple sclerosis (MS).

As I slid down a lonely Arkansas highway just as the sun’s warmth was cresting the horizon, I couldn’t help but think this may not have been one of my better ideas. If I managed to live through the next few seconds, not only would the entire world know I was an idiot, I would have one hell of a long walk home. I slid on my chest in slow motion, my motorcycle just a few feet ahead of me shedding pounds by the foot, marring the pavement while creating a fantastic light show. Bright, colorful sparks, the likes of which no Japanese bike could ever create. The bike was veering toward the right shoulder like an obedient pigeon, and I dragged my right boot like a rudder to follow it to its familiar home, the breakdown lane. Every believing biker knows tractor-trailers would never be allowed to drive past the pearly gates, so inhaling the mingled stench of burnt asbestos-flavored dust and decade-old recycled tread was a welcome relief I savored as if it were a fresh-baked blueberry pie. The 18-wheeler was the only other vehicle on the highway, and the out-of-tune screeching of brittle rubber composed the string section that accompanied the light show. The year was 2001, and although I had yet to show any of the progressive disabling symptoms of having multiple sclerosis, I was riding a motorcycle that most certainly did. It wasn’t the first time I shouted, “You Commie bastard!” But this time it was forceful enough to fog my face shield. I realized for the first time in almost two years of planning that my attempt to ride a Russian Ural in the Iron Butt Rally was insane, absurd and appeared to be grinding itself to an embarrassing finale. As the Earth beneath me stopped rotating, the sparks fizzled out, and the music died. The show was over. Nothing to see here. My attempt at finishing the World’s Toughest Motorcycle Competition was ending in the gutter. But it wasn’t for lack of trying. Within hours of the starting pistol, I had experienced a seized motor and the joy of a 150-mile tow in the wrong direction. A stranger with matching DNA transplanted his personal bike’s engine into my frame to help get me back on the road. Not bothering to do a proper test run on the older engine, I rode all night with a rough running motor and electrical issues, including no taillights. After a half hour’s rest in a dingy truck stop, I wasted four hours just trying to start the bike, alternating kicking and swearing with resting and praying before it haphazardly coughed to life. And now, a series of dips in the road caused the front end of my overloaded combative camel to oscillate into a crunchy wobble that intensified into a tank slapper and spit me off. “If life were easy, everyone would get one.”."

Friday March 30 2018 12:19 PM. Sensory Café Captures Customers ‘Experiencing’ Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Symptoms. Captivating video unveiled to show the day-to-day impact of living with MS. A sensory-experience café popped-up on Exchequer Street, Dublin 2 on Wednesday, 28th March, to give customers a truly impactful insight into the everyday challenges of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This thought-provoking video shows their reactions and interactions in the MSunderstood Café. The experiential Café aimed to give customers a taste of MS to highlight the urgent need for improved access to medicine and for the management of MS. Over 9,000 people are living with MS in Ireland, with thousands more family members affected, yet Ireland faces the worst access delays to new medicines in Western Europe. Speaking at the opening Karen Hynes, who lives with MS, said “This MSunderstood Café means the world to me as it shows a day in the life that I go through on a daily basis.”. The experiment involved replacing the menu boards, coffee mugs, floors and furniture with specially-created materials and followed customers as they tried to enjoy their coffee break. The simulated environment was created with people with MS to ensure all aspects of the café were as true to life as possible. The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland (MS Ireland), in partnership with Roche, opened the Café as people with MS (PwMS) need, expect and deserve quick access to new and effective treatments through a fair and sustainable system. A new website - PatientsDeserveBetter.ie - was also launched to help those affected by MS demand quick and better access to new medicine.

The laboratory-generated antibody GNbAC1 continued to limit brain shrinkage a year after relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients began receiving it, its developers announced. GeNeuro and Servier were reporting on the 12-month results of a Phase 2b clinical trial. GNbAC1 is a monoclonal antibody that destroys a harmful retroviral protein called pHERV-W which scientists have linked to brain lesions in MS patients. Lesions are areas where the myelin coating that protects nerve cells has deteriorated. The Phase 2b CHANGE-MS trial ( NCT02782858 ), conducted in 12 European countries, involved 270 RRMS patients. Researchers randomized them to receive the antibody or a placebo once a month by intravenous infusion. GeNeuro and Servier said a year’s worth of GNbAC1 led to much brain loss among MS patients than a regimen consisting of six months of a placebo and six months of the antibody. The difference in brain atrophy was 31 percent in the brain’s cortical area and 72 percent in the thalamic areas.

Predicting Episodic Memory Loss in Patients with MS. Mult Scler; ePub 2018 Mar 7; Koenig, et al. March 20, 2018. Functional activation may be useful as a predictive measure of episodic memory loss in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), a recent study found. Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a verbal episodic memory task, lesion load, and volumetric measures of the hippocampus and thalamus to assess the relative contributions to verbal and visual-spatial episodic memory in persons with MS (n=32) and healthy controls (n=16). They found:. MS Views and News provides Multiple Sclerosis education, information, resources and services that will benefit many affected by MS. Posted by Stuart at March 25, 2018. Sun Exposure Associated with Lower MS Risk. Neurology; ePub 2018 Mar 7; Tremlett, et al. Living in high ambient UV-B areas during childhood and the years leading up to multiple sclerosis (MS) onset was associated with a lower MS risk, according to a recent study. Furthermore, high summer sun exposure in high ambient UV-B areas was also associated with a reduced risk. Persons with MS (n=151) and age-matched controls (n=235) from the Nurses' Health Study cohorts completed questionnaires that assessed summer, winter, and lifetime sun exposure history. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated via conditional logistic regression with adjustment for body mass index, ancestry, smoking, and vitamin D supplementation.
