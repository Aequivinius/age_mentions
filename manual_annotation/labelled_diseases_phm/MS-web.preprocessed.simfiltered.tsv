medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4723496016533268047/FDA-approves-new-oral-drug-to-treat-relapsing-forms-of-multiple-sclerosis	FDA approves new oral drug to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis	"Reviewed by Kate Anderton, B.Sc. Mar 29 2019. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Mavenclad (cladribine) tablets to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults, to include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease. Mavenclad is not recommended for MS patients with clinically isolated syndrome. Because of its safety profile, the use of Mavenclad is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of MS. ""We are committed to supporting the development of safe and effective treatments for patients with multiple sclerosis,"" said Billy Dunn, M.D., director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""The approval of Mavenclad represents an additional option for patients who have tried another treatment without success."" MS is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communications between the brain and other parts of the body. Most people experience their first symptoms of MS between the ages of 20 and 40. MS is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults and occurs more frequently in women than in men. For most people, MS starts with a relapsing-remitting course, in which episodes of worsening function (relapses) are followed by recovery periods (remissions). These remissions may not be complete and may leave patients with some degree of residual disability. Many, but not all, patients with MS experience some degree of persistent disability that gradually worsens over time. In some patients, disability may progress independent of relapses, a process termed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). In the first few years of this process, many patients continue to experience relapses, a phase of the disease described as active SPMS. Active SPMS is one of the relapsing forms of MS, and drugs approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS can be used to treat active SPMS. The efficacy of Mavenclad was shown in a clinical trial in 1,326 patients with relapsing forms of MS who had least one relapse in the previous 12 months. Mavenclad significantly decreased the number of relapses experienced by these patients compared to placebo. Mavenclad also reduced the progression of disability compared to placebo. Mavenclad must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug's uses and risks. Mavenclad has a Boxed Warning for an increased risk of malignancy and fetal harm. Mavenclad is not to be used in patients with current malignancy. In patients with prior malignancy or with increased risk of malignancy, health care professionals should evaluate the benefits and risks of the use of Mavenclad on an individual patient basis. Health care professionals should follow standard cancer screening guidelines in patients treated with Mavenclad. The drug should not be used in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception during treatment and for six months after the course of therapy because of the potential for fetal harm. Mavenclad should be stopped if the patient becomes pregnant. Other warnings include the risk of decreased lymphocyte (white blood cell) counts; lymphocyte counts should be monitored before, during and after treatment. Mavenclad may increase the risk of infections; health care professionals should screen patients for infections and treatment with Mavenclad should be delayed if necessary. Mavenclad may cause hematologic toxicity and bone marrow suppression so health care professionals should measure a patient's complete blood counts before, during and after therapy. The drug has been associated with graft-versus-host-disease following blood transfusions with non-irradiated blood. Mavenclad may cause liver injury and treatment should be interrupted or discontinued, as appropriate, if clinically significant liver injury is suspected. The most common adverse reactions reported by patients receiving Mavenclad in the clinical trials include upper respiratory tract infections, headache and decreased lymphocyte counts. The FDA granted approval of Mavenclad to EMD Serono, Inc. Source:.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4723292921028156705/Good-News-for-Those-Not-Fond-of-Time-in-an-MRI-Tube	Good News for Those Not Fond of Time in an MRI Tube	For people living with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, regularly scheduled trips into a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tube can range from long and boring to traumatic. Depending on your degree of disease activity, your lesion load, and the standard practice of your MS provider, you can expect MRI appointments every 6 to 24 months. Many if not most of our readers will know of the contrast agent gadolinium. It’s what is injected into our veins about halfway through the scans. Gadolinium shows where “leaks” in the blood-brain barrier are, causing MS lesions. You may have heard or read of gadolinium as “ contrast .” Contrast agents like gadolinium make certain structures or tissues in the body appear different on the MRI images so they are more visible to your physician. For a number of years there has been concern about the heavy metal deposits gadolinium may leave in our brains . A new study, published in March 2019 in the journal Radiology , suggested that the use of gadolinium enhancement may not be needed to get images that are good enough to gauge MS progression. Side Benefits of No Gadolinium in the MRI. Although health concerns may have been a factor in calling for the study , I think the side benefits of this change will be of great importance to people with MS as well. First, of course, possible complications of repeated gadolinium exposure would be reduced. But, as I stated, most of us will know gadolinium from the injection halfway through the scan. The time in the noisy tube could be significantly reduced. Less time in the machine would mean that follow-up scans should be less costly. The psychological toll these scans take on those of us who find the cramped scanners claustrophobic cannot be underestimated either. I know some people with MS who require mild sedation to make it through these procedures. The Findings Only Apply to 3T MRI Scanners. I noted in the study that 3T machines were used in the research. If your clinic uses a 1.5T machine (the number references strength of the magnets used), the research wouldn’t apply. With 1.5T still the standard technology for MRI scanners, I know it took me some time to find a 3T machine where I live (and it’ll be a five-hour drive the next time I need a scan). So not everyone will be able to benefit from this new finding. As always, have a detailed conversation with your MS healthcare team (and your care partners) when it comes to deciding if gadolinium contrast can be skipped in your next scan. The jury is still out as to what harm long-term exposure to gadolinium might cause. So weighing risk to benefit will be an important discussion. Wishing you and your family the best of health.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4723368429764026351/Major-step-towards-individual-cancer-immunotherapy	Major step towards individual cancer immunotherapy	"Cells belonging to the body's own immune system can help fight tumours. For several years now, this has allowed oncologists to use medications known as checkpoint inhibitors to encourage T cells to eliminate tumour cells. Last year the two scientists who discovered this therapeutic approach were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine. While doctors are enjoying some initial successes with this method, especially with regard to melanomas and several other types of cancer, immunologists and cancer researchers are working to develop the approach further. What they have in mind is a vaccine that would cause cancer-repelling T cells to multiply in the body, thereby strengthening the body's immune defences. The big question is which molecules are suitable for a vaccine? Researchers working in the team of Manfred Kopf, Professor of Molecular Biomedicine, have now developed a method for identifying such molecules. The search for a rapport between immune cells and tumour cells. Since on the one hand tumours differ greatly from patient to patient, and on the other no two people (except identical twins) have the same immune system, future immunisation against cancer is a complex example of personalised medicine. The goal is to develop an individual vaccine for each patient. Potential vaccines include pieces of proteins, known as peptides, that are found only in tumours due to a mutation. Because T cells are specific and always recognise only one particular peptide, just as a key fits only one lock, a further prerequisite for a vaccine of this kind is that the patient has T cells capable of recognising these cancer peptides in the first place. So before doctors can immunise a cancer patient, laboratory tests must be conducted to search for corresponding pairs of T cells and peptides. A peptide that is recognised by a T cell can be used for personalised immunisation. The vaccine should then activate the T cells in the body that recognise only that peptide (and thus tumour cells). These T cells should ultimately wipe out the tumour. The ETH researchers' method makes it possible for a laboratory to determine which T cells recognise which peptide. Up to now this has been incredibly difficult. The scientists used tumours in mice to show that their approach works. Next, they want to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in dealing with tumours in humans. Every patient gets their own set of reporter cells. At the heart of this new method lies a collection of several million reporter cells, each one of which presents on its cell surface one of many peptides found in a tumour. The reporter cells are designed to turn green as soon as a T cell interacts with it due to recognition of the presented peptide. This enables the scientists to identify those tumour peptides that the T cells of a cancer patient recognises. This involves mixing the collection of reporter cells with T cells taken from the patient's tumour, isolating the reporter cells that turn green and identifying the peptide they carry. Since each person (and each vertebrate generally) has a unique immune system, and since each tumour carries a unique pattern of mutations, the scientists must produce a different set of reporter cells for each patient. ""One option is to determine the tumour's genetic sequence and compare it with the gene sequence of the patient's healthy cells,"" Kopf says. This lets the researchers determine the extent to which the tumour differs from healthy tissue and then transfer the genetic information with precisely these tumour-specific differences into the reporter cells. As Kopf explains, ""Other scientists are using computer predictions to try and find out which cancer peptides are suited to this type of immunisation. But this approach is only as good as the algorithms used - and at the moment, they aren't very reliable. By contrast, we have developed an experimental test that assures us that the T cells recognise patient tumour peptides."" Initial tests involving a breast cancer model in mice showed Kopf and his colleagues that their method works. In immunised mice, the immune system did indeed attack the tumour; in the non-immunised mice that the scientists used as a control, this did not happen. The scientists already patented this method five years ago. In 2015, their promising discovery won them ETH Zurich's Spark Award. Their work was recently published in the specialist journal Nature Immunology . To develop commercial applications for the technique, the scientists founded an ETH spin-off called Tepthera. This start-up plans to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach also using tumours in humans. Just as interesting for autoimmune diseases. ""Essentially, our technique and personalised immunisation hold out promise for the treatment of all cancers - especially in combination with checkpoint inhibitors,"" Kopf says, adding that the technology could also be used in the research and treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis or type 1 diabetes. Unlike healthy people's immune system, the immune system in people who suffer from autoimmune diseases attacks not only foreign or mutated cells, but also the autoimmune patient's own body cells. In the case of many of these conditions, it is not yet known against which native molecules the autoimmune response is directed. This is something that can now be researched using the new method. In contrast to cancer, where the idea is to use immunisation to activate the killer cells, for autoimmune diseases the aim is to develop a vaccine that tempers the immune system.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Mother's Day. Thursday March 28 2019 08:51 AM. This week Teresa McShane shares her mixed emotions about being a mum with MS and how she really feels about Mother's Day 2019. I never really imagined being a Mother. As a girl growing up, I can't remember ever having had that thought in my mind. It wasn't on my radar. It wasn't until I was diagnosed with MS in 1994 that I had to ask the question, ‘What about kids?' Thankfully, my fears were allayed when I was told there was no reason why I couldn't or shouldn't have children. So, fast forward 25 years and here I am with two wonderful boys, 15 and 13 and Mother's Day 2019 is just around the corner. Shelves with gift suggestions are neatly styled and stocked with goodies for ‘that special day'. Grand displays of floral-designed cards suggest I am a ‘Wonderful Mum', ‘A Mum in a Million' or, could I actually be ‘THE World's Best Mum EVER'? Well, on the one side, I'm not really ‘a card person'. And I am hugely cynical about the massive marketing and emotional blackmail involved in all these ‘significant' dates in the calendar. But once a year, it is good for families to take stock of all the things that their Mums do. And Mums do do a lot. Having said that, I don't think Mums keep a record, a tally of their daily chores because that's what we signed up to. That was the deal. Occasionally I acknowledge the fact that having MS has made my job as a mum more challenging. Mums with MS still have to do everything that other Mum's without MS do. We still have to do shopping, washing, cooking, and homework, tend to wounds, allay fears and wipe away tears. Be up to speed on training schedules, matches and play dates. Keep a house. Not to mention know where the other football sock or gum shield or left shoe is! It's exhausting on top of exhaustion. Thinking about it now, no wonder I have brain fog! And as a Mum with MS I can't help but judge myself for my failings. I get frustrated at the fact that my kids sometimes miss out on things because I can't do them or take them so there can be a huge reliance on partners, friends and family to fill in the gaps. I am lucky to have that support around me. My kids have grown up with these limitations but I hope they know that as their Mum I have always tried to do my best for them. So, on that note, I will accept the flowery card for the afternoons I tried to play ball in the garden with my son and fell over in the flowerbeds. I will accept the breakfast in bed for the nights I tended to my sick child when the fatigue was like a corn mill bearing down on top of me. And I will gladly sit back and read the Sunday paper for the mornings I stared up the staircase with a laundry basket in my hand feeling like I was about to attempt Everest. But I also acknowledge the greatest gift of all for me on Sunday 31st March is that I am blessed to be a Mum.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4724107279886228431/What-Is-Secondary-Progressive-Multiple-Sclerosis?	What Is Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis?	March 28, 2019. If your doctor says you have secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), it means you're in a different stage of your disease. Most folks get it after living for a while with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). In SPMS, you may not get any break in your symptoms, unlike RRMS, when you had flare-ups that came and went. But your doctor can suggest medicine to help manage them. Secondary vs. Relapsing-Remitting MS. About 85% of people with MS start with the relapsing-remitting form. They get attacks of symptoms called relapses, followed by symptom-free periods called remissions. During relapses, your immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- causes inflammation that damages the protective coating around nerve fibers. This disrupts the flow of nerve signals to and from the brain and spinal cord. It leads to symptoms like tiredness, numbness, and weakness. Then the immune system stops attacking. Your symptoms improve or disappear, and you go into remission. Relapses and remissions alternate over time. In SPMS, your symptoms steadily get worse instead of coming and going. You might still have relapses, but they don't happen as often. What Causes SPMS? It's not clear exactly why RRMS changes to SPMS. Some researchers think it happens because of nerve damage that occurred earlier in the disease. Not everyone with the relapsing-remitting form of the disease will get SPMS. Doctors don't know for sure who will and who won't, and how quickly it will happen. You're more likely to change to SPMS if:. When Do People Change to SPMS? A small number of people start out with SPMS. They may have had RRMS first, but it wasn't diagnosed or their symptoms were too mild to notice. Before disease-modifying drugs were available, half of people with RRMS changed to SPMS within 10 years. New treatments have altered the course of MS. Today these drugs can slow MS and delay the move towards SPMS, although doctors don't know how much they delay it. What to Expect.

Hi all,. Surely many of you have no idea of who I am -- I use to be a very active co-community leader on this forum, and I had committed myself to help keep facts straight for those just like me, who at one point in their lives needed some serious information (once the old coup began to work again), and the only straight stuff was coming directly from patients themselves. Much has happened in the 2 or so years, and I've been fairly absent (though so many have never left my thoughts) and intend on getting back to helping out, catching up with those it's been way too long for, and meeting those who've come along. I hope the holidays were good to you, and you've not terribly over done yourselves because a new year is on the horizon, and you know what that means.....R...E...S...O....hahah... no resolutions.... Though I do resolve to get familiar with our great community again - it's been way too long. Cheers to you all - see you around. 	0	0	Merry|Christmas|,|Happy|Holidays|,|and|get|the|appetizers|ready|it's|almost|2016|...|-|Multiple|Sclerosis|-|MedHelp	Merry|Christmas|,|Happy|Holidays|,|and|get|the|appetizers|ready|it's|almost|2016|...|-|Multiple|Sclerosis|-|MedHelp|.|Hi|all|,|.|Surely|many|of|you|have|no|idea|of|who|I|am|-|-|I|use|to|be|a|very|active|co-community|leader|on|this|forum|,|and|I|had|committed|myself|to|help|keep|facts|straight|for|those|just|like|me|,|who|at|one|point|in|their|lives|needed|some|serious|information|(|once|the|old|coup|began|to|work|again|)|,|and|the|only|straight|stuff|was|coming|directly|from|patients|themselves|.|Much|has|happened|in|the|2|or|so|years|,|and|I've|been|fairly|absent|(|though|so|many|have|never|left|my|thoughts|)|and|intend|on|getting|back|to|helping|out|,|catching|up|with|those|it's|been|way|too|long|for|,|and|meeting|those|who've|come|along|.|I|hope|the|holidays|were|good|to|you|,|and|you've|not|terribly|over|done|yourselves|because|a|new|year|is|on|the|horizon|,|and|you|know|what|that|means|...|R|...|E|...|S|...|O|...|hahah|...|no|resolutions|...|Though|I|do|resolve|to|get|familiar|with|our|great|community|again|-|it's|been|way|too|long|.|Cheers|to|you|all|-|see|you|around|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4722117989345551941/is-a-spinal-tap-needed-to-diagnose-MS?---Multiple-Sclerosis---MedHelp	is a spinal tap needed to diagnose MS? - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp	"is a spinal tap needed to diagnose MS? - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp. Hi, and welcome to the MS Forum. I hope we can help with some of your questions. The main ?? is whether or not a spinal tap is needed for a diagnosis of MS. the easy answer is ""no"", but that doesn't tell the whole story. There is no requirement in all of the criteria for diagnosing MS that one must have an LP (Lumbar Puncture or spinal tap). However, a tap may be very useful to add evidence to the picture that MS might be responsible for a person's problems IF it is positive (for O-Bands or for an elevated IgG Index). Where many neurologists become confused in what to think if the LP is negative. If it is negative IT DOES NOT RULE OUT MS. Again, it is incorrect to rule out MS as the diagnosis if the LP is negative. When you say you had R-sided pain, did you mean in your abdomen? Did the GI work up rule out Celiac Disease? This can be an elusive thing to find and can cause neurologic symptoms. I also assume you had blood tests for ESR, ANA, B12, Lyme Disease, HIV, VDRL, ACE, Anti-Phospholipid and anti-cardiolipin, plus several more? The process of diagnosing MS goes something like this:. 1) The neurologist looks for a pattern of symptoms where first there is an onset of symptoms consistent with demyelination in the central nervous system. The most common demyelinating disease is, by far, MS. They look for repeated attacks, which after time improve or go away. Then, for any subsequent attack. If they have this Attack-Improvement or Relapse-Remitting pattern the suspicion for MS rises. If there is only one attack, they can be suspicious, but they will want much more evidence. 2) The next thing that is required is a completely thorough, head-to-toe neuro exam and they look for evidence of damage to the central nervous system (CNS) in two or more places. Do you have any abnormalities on your exam - like hyperactive reflexes,abnormal eye exam, altered sensation (especially from one side to the other), and such? This would include the new tremor in your thumb. 3) Usually the next thing would be an MRI of the brain and, many experts believe that an MRI of the spine should be included - the cervical spinal cord at least. If the MRI is abnormal in a way that is consistent with MS, then with the pattern of two or more attacks and two or more distinct places in the CNS, then there is actually enough information to diagnose MS --->>. 4) IF all the other things known to cause neurologic problems like this are ruled out, like autoimmune diseases, Vit12 deficiency, infections, cancer, and such. MS cannot be diagnosed until a full ""rule-out"" has been done. Most of this is by blood work. Now, MS also frequently causes lesions in the spinal cord. If your neurologist wants to do an LP because he needs more evidence, it would make most sense to do the spinal cord MRI next because it can supply the needed evidence to make the diagnosis sometimes and it is recommended to do this if the evidence from the history and physical and the brain MRI are not enough. Also, since you have had visual problems, it makes sense to have you be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist to be work up for optic neuritis. This would typically be done by first an eye exam. If the eye exam showed signs of optic neuritis such as paleness of the optic disc at the back of the eye (when they look deep inside) or by defects in your visual field, then this is another big piece of info that would point toward MS and make an LP less necessary. If the eye exam was normal, you still could have had optic neuritis, because the exam is normal in 64% of people who have had optic neuritis. Then you would want to have a VEP - Visual Evoked Potential - to look for the signs of optic neuritis in another way. So, two tests that you didn't mention would be the spinal cord MRI and a VEP to look for more evidence of MS. If those didn't provide the evidence needed for a diagnosis, then a spinal tap (LP) would be recommended. Now, some neurologists insist on an LP for everyone, but that is not actually required. Do you have the report of the MRI? This can be useful to have to see exactly what they said about the lesions in the white matter. Foci = spots, or lesions. Too many neurologists expect the MRI to be absolutely classic for MS, when all it has to be is consistent. Now, I have a couple more questions. What was your pattern of symptoms as they developed? Have any improved? Did you have any period where things seemed better? What was your neuro exam like? Was your ESR elevated? Have you had any joint pain or arthritis? Well, I have gone on and on. The main point here is that MS is a little sticky to diagnose. The docs have to look at a lot of things and their patterns. And, there may be a couple more non-invasive things to do before an LP is necessary. However, I would advise you to have the LP if the doc really needs the evidence. I hope this helps. I am one of the forum's co-leaders and before being disabled by MS I practiced medicine for 23 years. Others will be by soon to add their hello's and advice and support. Quix, MD.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702815046749225822/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	"My journey began in November 2009. I had been having a lot of aches and stiffness in my neck one day during work. When I got home, I took an anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxer, took a hot shower, and went to bed. The next morning, I felt drunk. I almost fell down my stairs, and could not walk straight. I was embarrassed when I stopped at the gas station, because I was stumbling everywhere on the sidewalk walking to my car, I knew people were looking at me. By the time I got to work that morning, I knew something was not right with me. My co-workers agreed something wasn't right, and someone drove me to the hospital. As I sat in the exam room in the ER, I just figured I was having some kind of reaction to the medication I had taken for my neck the night before. The doctor ordered a CAT scan and ran some lab work. I will never forget those moments that followed. The doctor came into the room after I had my tests done. He shut the door behind him, walked over to me carrying my file, and he sat down on the table next to me. He said, ""I don't have good news. There appears to be lesions on your brain and spinal cord. More than likely, you have Multiple Sclerosis."" At that time, I didn't know what MS was. I was terrified. This was my life-changing moment. I went and saw a neurologist a week later. He ordered an MRI and spinal tap. Diagnosis of RRMS confirmed: November 2009, Age 22. I was put on Copaxone and Solu-Medrol IV treatments right away. The steroids helped tremendously. I continued the Copaxone up until last year, I couldn't stand the pain every night anymore. So, I am hoping to start a different form of treatment in the near future.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Christina's MS Story. Tuesday March 26 2019 10:00 AM. Last year I took on the challenge of the VHI Women’s Mini Marathon for Multiple Sclerosis Ireland and I can’t wait to take part again this year. I was diagnosed with MS in 2016, age 26. I went to bed one night, followed my normal bedtime routine and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The next day I woke up and I experienced my first MS attack; my whole life changed in an instant. I couldn’t control my body movements. I was paralyzed down the left side of my body and it wouldn’t move the way I wanted it to. It would even make strange movements without my permission. Long story short, I had lesions on the part of my brain that controls my voluntary body movements. This impacted my mobility and I was quickly diagnosed with MS. When you go from being healthy one day and waking up the next not being able to move your body properly, you really do re-evaluate everything. I have experienced what it’s like to lose something that I took for granted, like walking across the room or walking down the street; now I try to make sure I never take anything for granted again. I face challenges with my MS on a daily basis. Fatigue is a big symptom and it can get in the way of training and exercising. Even at the Mini Marathon you can face struggles, especially on a warm day. Last year I saw a women taking part in the Mini Marathon in full army gear. I told my friends that’s what MS is like for me! You feel like you have weights attached to your arms and legs, and I carry that around with me everywhere! Taking part in the Mini Marathon means a lot of different things to me. It makes me feel proud of myself and is a way for me to celebrate my ability to be lucky enough to jog it. I am in remission, so I will make the most of it and that’s why I love taking part. I am not wasting the opportunity because one day I may not be given that luxury. I focus on the here and now, and now I am doing well, so I will jog it and if I can’t jog it, I will walk it!! The VHI Women’s Mini Marathon can be tough and of course there are struggles, but I can’t even describe how rewarding, proud, emotional and happy you feel when you have completed the race. I cannot wait to do it again for MS Ireland this year, to represent all my fellow MSer’s and stand alongside all the other women ready to begin the race for a charity they hold close to their hearts. It really is a beautiful feeling. To join Christina and Team MS Ireland sign up today by visiting. Get in touch.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4722811806552853751/What-is-the-Modified-Fatigue-Impact-Scale?	What is the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale?	The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) is a tool that doctors use to evaluate how fatigue affects someone’s life. Fatigue is a common and often frustrating symptom for up to 80 percent of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) . Some people with MS find it hard to accurately describe their MS-related fatigue to their doctor. Others have difficulty communicating the full effect that fatigue has on their daily life. The MFIS involves answering or evaluating a series of questions or statements about your physical, cognitive, and psychosocial health. It’s a quick process that can go a long way toward helping your doctor fully understand how fatigue affects you. This makes it easier to come up with an effective plan for managing it. Read on to learn more about the MFIS, including the questions it covers and how it’s scored. How is the test administered? The MFIS is generally presented as a 21-item questionnaire, but there’s also a 5-question version. Most people fill it out on their own in a doctor’s office. Expect to spend anywhere from five to ten minutes circling your answers. If you have vision problems or trouble writing, ask to go through the questionnaire orally. Your doctor or someone else in the office can read off the questions and note your answers. Don’t hesitate to ask for clarification if you don’t fully understand any of the questions. What are the questions? Simply saying you’re fatigued usually doesn’t convey the reality of how you’re feeling. That’s why the MFIS questionnaire addresses several aspects of your daily life to paint a more complete picture. Some of the statements focus on physical abilities:. * I have been clumsy and uncoordinated. * My muscles feel weak . Some statements address cognitive matters, such as memory, concentration, and decision-making:. Other statements reflect psychosocial aspects of your health, which refers to your moods, feelings, relationships, and coping strategies. Examples include:. * I have been less motivated to participate in social activities . You can find the full list of questions here . You’ll be asked to describe how strongly each statement reflects your experiences in the last four weeks. All you have to do is circle one of these options on a scale of 0 to 4:.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4722066779456934647/How-to-MS-Like-a-Boss---MS-Connection	How to MS Like a Boss - MS Connection	How do you MS like a boss?! How do you “own it?”. How do you feel more self-empowered with MS? I was super inspired by the recent actions of ultimate-MS-boss Selma Blair beautifully displaying herself on the red carpet at the vanity fair Oscar party for the first time since her multiple sclerosis diagnosis. She stood poised for photos looking proud with her head held high and personalized cane outstretched, powerfully “throwing” her Ralph & Russo gown outwards for a dramatic photographic look. She discussed how you “shouldn’t have to sacrifice style” when you have MS, and the actress announced she is also making an accessible fashion line. In case you missed her Good Morning America interview a few weeks ago, I strongly urge you to . Selma was incredibly brave doing this interview, but doing the interview whilst she was also having a flare up where she was suffering from spasmodic dysphonia—meaning she was struggling to talk? That’s positively boss like. Being in the public eye and coming out in an interview that is so honest and transparent is a very brave thing for a celebrity to do. Can you imagine broadcasting to the world about your innermost personal symptoms? How scary must that have been for her? I've seen many people online say, “well it’s ok for her, but what about the rest of us that deal with this everyday? We don’t get special treatment or attention.” To those people I would say, see the bigger picture of what this means for MS and for her as an actress! She doesn’t have to just announce it to work colleagues, friends and family like we do she has to announce it to the world . Everybody in her world will be treating her differently now. She’ll be getting letters and messages from fans on a daily basis wanting to tell her about their diagnosis story. It may affect any future acting roles she gets as an actress because directors may think twice about casting her and worried she won’t be up to the job. She may even lose jobs. The most important thing that will happen now that Selma has bravely raised awareness of her condition is that the general public will now understand more about what MS is and how it affects us. Celebrities have the power to influence the general public and by sharing her story in this way she has done a very powerful thing. All those times we were told that MS wasn’t a real condition? I would hope that becomes a thing of the past. All those times doctors and neuro’s have said “it’s all in your head” (which, ironically, it actually is!), I imagine patients would be taken more seriously. So, is it a good thing that Selma Blair came out about her diagnosis? HELL YES ! She’s helping to change the worlds perception of MS. She has the ultimate platform for influence, and she’s using it for good, so let’s celebrate her for bringing MS into the mainstream media. And let’s certainly celebrate her for making an accessible clothing line because these celebrities are the only ones changing disability for the better. How do you feel about Selma’s diagnosis? Should celebrities highlight their health conditions?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4720868607585042286/QA:-Research-needed-into-treating-anxiety-with-CBD	Q&A: Research needed into treating anxiety with CBD	MARCH 21, 2019 by From Mayo Clinic News Network. Dear Mayo Clinic: Is there any harm in trying CBD for anxiety? It seems to have helped my co-worker, but I am hesitant to try it without knowing more about it. A: Cannabidiol, also known as CBD, has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat anxiety. Although some research appears to indicate that CBD might hold benefit for treating anxiety-related disorders, more study is needed. Cannabidiol may interfere with other prescriptions, and it can have side effects, so talk with your health care provider before you take any form of CBD. Cannabidiol is a chemical found in marijuana, but it doesn't contain tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that produces a high. The typical formulation of CBD is a liquid that you take orally. But CBD also is sold as an extract, a vaporized liquid and an oil-based capsule. Foods, drinks and beauty products are among the many CBD-infused products available. Epidiolex is the only CBD product authorized by the FDA. This prescription medication is approved to treat two types of epilepsy: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. Aside from Epidiolex, which is approved for use nationwide, U.S. state laws vary regarding other forms of CBD. Cannabidiol has been studied as a treatment for a wide range of conditions, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and anxiety. But research supporting the drug's benefits for these disorders is limited. For example, one recent review of research looked at results from numerous studies that examined the effectiveness and safety of medical cannabis—including both CBD- and THC-based medicines—to treat mental disorders. The review found that, when given with other medication, as well as psychotherapy, CBD and THC medications were associated with some symptom improvement. But the researchers emphasized the need for more thorough investigation before making a firm recommendation on the use of any form of medical cannabis to treat mental disorders. Another study involving 72 participants that was published in January examined whether CBD can help improve anxiety and sleep quality. It found a decrease in anxiety symptoms in 57 of the study participants and concluded that CBD may hold benefit for anxiety-related disorders. But, again, the researchers indicated that larger, controlled clinical research studies are needed to confirm this initial finding. There are potential risks to be aware of with CBD use, too. In some cases, it can cause side effects, such as dry mouth, diarrhea, reduced appetite, drowsiness and fatigue. Rarely, it may have an effect on liver function. CBD also can interfere with the effectiveness of other medications you're taking, such as blood thinners. Another cause for concern is the unreliability of the purity and dosage of CBD in nonprescription products. A recent study of 84 CBD products bought online showed that more than one-quarter of the products contained less CBD than labeled. In addition, THC was found in 18 of the products. Before you use a product that contains CBD, talk to your health care provider. And discuss other possible treatment options for anxiety, too. In many cases, a type of psychotherapy known as cognitive behavioral therapy , along with anti-anxiety medication, can reduce anxiety symptoms significantly. 	0	0	Q|&|A|:|Research|needed|into|treating|anxiety|with|CBD	MARCH|21|,|2019|by|From|Mayo|Clinic|News|Network|.|Dear|Mayo|Clinic|:|Is|there|any|harm|in|trying|CBD|for|anxiety|?|It|seems|to|have|helped|my|co-worker|,|but|I|am|hesitant|to|try|it|without|knowing|more|about|it|.|A|:|Cannabidiol|,|also|known|as|CBD|,|has|not|been|approved|by|the|Food|and|Drug|Administration|(|FDA|)|to|treat|anxiety|.|Although|some|research|appears|to|indicate|that|CBD|might|hold|benefit|for|treating|anxiety-related|disorders|,|more|study|is|needed|.|Cannabidiol|may|interfere|with|other|prescriptions|,|and|it|can|have|side|effects|,|so|talk|with|your|health|care|provider|before|you|take|any|form|of|CBD|.|Cannabidiol|is|a|chemical|found|in|marijuana|,|but|it|doesn't|contain|tetrahydrocannabinol|,|or|THC|,|the|psychoactive|ingredient|in|marijuana|that|produces|a|high|.|The|typical|formulation|of|CBD|is|a|liquid|that|you|take|orally|.|But|CBD|also|is|sold|as|an|extract|,|a|vaporized|liquid|and|an|oil-based|capsule|.|Foods|,|drinks|and|beauty|products|are|among|the|many|CBD-infused|products|available|.|Epidiolex|is|the|only|CBD|product|authorized|by|the|FDA|.|This|prescription|medication|is|approved|to|treat|two|types|of|epilepsy|:|Lennox-Gastaut|syndrome|and|Dravet|syndrome|.|Aside|from|Epidiolex|,|which|is|approved|for|use|nationwide|,|U|.|S|.|state|laws|vary|regarding|other|forms|of|CBD|.|Cannabidiol|has|been|studied|as|a|treatment|for|a|wide|range|of|conditions|,|including|Parkinson's|disease|,|schizophrenia|,|diabetes|,|multiple|sclerosis|and|anxiety|.|But|research|supporting|the|drug's|benefits|for|these|disorders|is|limited|.|For|example|,|one|recent|review|of|research|looked|at|results|from|numerous|studies|that|examined|the|effectiveness|and|safety|of|medical|cannabis|—|including|both|CBD|-|and|THC-based|medicines|—|to|treat|mental|disorders|.|The|review|found|that|,|when|given|with|other|medication|,|as|well|as|psychotherapy|,|CBD|and|THC|medications|were|associated|with|some|symptom|improvement|.|But|the|researchers|emphasized|the|need|for|more|thorough|investigation|before|making|a|firm|recommendation|on|the|use|of|any|form|of|medical|cannabis|to|treat|mental|disorders|.|Another|study|involving|72|participants|that|was|published|in|January|examined|whether|CBD|can|help|improve|anxiety|and|sleep|quality|.|It|found|a|decrease|in|anxiety|symptoms|in|57|of|the|study|participants|and|concluded|that|CBD|may|hold|benefit|for|anxiety-related|disorders|.|But|,|again|,|the|researchers|indicated|that|larger|,|controlled|clinical|research|studies|are|needed|to|confirm|this|initial|finding|.|There|are|potential|risks|to|be|aware|of|with|CBD|use|,|too|.|In|some|cases|,|it|can|cause|side|effects|,|such|as|dry|mouth|,|diarrhea|,|reduced|appetite|,|drowsiness|and|fatigue|.|Rarely|,|it|may|have|an|effect|on|liver|function|.|CBD|also|can|interfere|with|the|effectiveness|of|other|medications|you're|taking|,|such|as|blood|thinners|.|Another|cause|for|concern|is|the|unreliability|of|the|purity|and|dosage|of|CBD|in|nonprescription|products|.|A|recent|study|of|84|CBD|products|bought|online|showed|that|more|than|one-quarter|of|the|products|contained|less|CBD|than|labeled|.|In|addition|,|THC|was|found|in|18|of|the|products|.|Before|you|use|a|product|that|contains|CBD|,|talk|to|your|health|care|provider|.|And|discuss|other|possible|treatment|options|for|anxiety|,|too|.|In|many|cases|,|a|type|of|psychotherapy|known|as|cognitive|behavioral|therapy|,|along|with|anti-anxiety|medication|,|can|reduce|anxiety|symptoms|significantly|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4719441373046281546/Common-treatment-for-multiple-sclerosis-may-prolong-life	Common treatment for multiple sclerosis may prolong life	"Researchers from the University of British Columbia and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute have found that a widely prescribed drug for multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with longer survival for patients. The study, published today in the journal Brain , found that people with MS who took a beta interferon drug had a 32 per cent lower mortality risk than those that did not take the drug. This was particularly evident among MS patients who took beta interferon for more than three years. The study, which followed nearly 6,000 people with MS in Canada and France over a period of more than two decades, is the first and largest of its kind to look at mortality associated with beta interferon for the treatment of MS. ""This is a significant study,"" said lead author Elaine Kingwell, a research associate and epidemiologist in the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health and the faculty of medicine at UBC, and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute. ""Although these drugs have been prescribed since the mid-1990s, it takes time before scientists can look at the effect of these treatments on a long-term outcome like survival. We found that patients who were treated with these drugs during routine clinical practice survived longer overall than patients who had not taken beta interferon."" MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, in which cells from the immune system attack and damage the nerve cells' protective sheath. The disease often results in disability and can have a significant impact on quality of life. The beta interferons were the first drugs to be approved for the treatment of relapsing-onset MS, which is the most common form of the disease. They have been used to treat MS longer than any other disease-modifying therapy. Comparing mortality rates between two countries. For the study, the researchers followed 5,989 people with relapsing-onset MS from as early as 1986 until 2013, in British Columbia and France, to determine what disease modifying drugs they took and how long they survived. The mean age of the study participants (who had not received drug treatments for MS before the start of the study) was 42 years. The mean age at death for the 742 people who did not survive to the end of the study was 61. The findings were consistent between the two geographic groups and between men and women. MS patients who took beta interferon for at least six months had a reduced mortality risk when compared to MS patients who did not take beta interferon. Taking the drug for more than three years had an even stronger association with increased survival. Moreover, increased survival was noted even for individuals who started the drug after age 40, or five or more years after disease onset. Findings are encouraging to those on beta interferon. Vancouver resident Sharon Roman, who was diagnosed with MS two decades ago, describes the results as ""encouraging."" ""The study findings could impact a lot of people, not just because of the sheer number of patients that are on beta interferon worldwide, but also because it offers comfort in terms of our longevity--and comfort is in short supply for those with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis,"" she said. ""This offers a potential incentive that could conquer a dislike or a fear of injections and might encourage people to adhere to the prescribed dosing schedule,"" she added. Quality of life needs to be considered, too. Despite the positive findings, the researchers caution that longevity isn't everything. ""Now that we know that life might be extended for people with MS who take these drugs, we do have to consider quality of life,"" said the study's senior author Helen Tremlett, professor in the division of neurology at UBC and the Canada Research Chair in neuroepidemiology and multiple sclerosis. ""Further research to look at this aspect of treatment outcomes is certainly warranted."" The researchers hope to now look at the association of survival with some of the newer MS drugs. Tremlett has received a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to undertake this work. The study was co-authored by Dr. Emmanuelle Leray at Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Santé Publique and Dr. Gilles Edan at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes in Rennes, France, and Dr. John Petkau in the department of statistics and Dr. Joel Oger and Feng Zhu in the department of medicine (neurology) at UBC.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4719094552239671128/MS-Ireland--::-Clues-to-Identify	MS Ireland  :: Clues to Identify	MS Ireland  ::. Clues to Identify. What are some clues to cognitive dysfunction? Memory problems top the list. Forgetting names, appointments, phone numbers, movie plots, what to do next, or what goes into the favourite family recipe, are examples of memory deficits. There can also be difficulty learning new information and concentrating on a task or conversational topic. Slowed information processing is also a frequent problem. Everything takes longer. It may be impossible to play games that are time sensitive. Response time is slowed. It may take longer to shave, bathe and dress. Attention and concentration suffer. Inability to focus, difficulty following a conversation or remembering details from a conversation, problems relating a story, difficulty reading, concentrating, or following a movie plot are examples of attention deficits. Being easily distracted and flitting from task to task or idea to idea are examples of difficulties with concentration. The ability to multitask or shift between tasks becomes difficult or impossible. Reasoning and problem solving difficulties, making poor decisions, and having poor judgment can be difficult to recognise and more difficult to deal with for Care Givers. Slowness to understand analogies or parables, difficulty “getting” jokes, taking things at face value, being literal or concrete, and finding it difficult to analyse complex situations, are all evidence of cognitive decline. Executive functions such as the ability to plan and carry out a task like planning a daughter’s wedding or a holiday trip can be affected in MS. Becoming overwhelmed by a pending task can result in confusion over where to begin, and may be associated with compensatory anger and withdrawal. Visual perceptual function and spatial orientation problems can include difficulty following directions or programming a VCR, confusion over right and left, and difficulty visualising how a certain piece of adaptive equipment could be useful, even driving. How can cognitive changes be managed in advanced MS? Are there medications that can help with cognitive decline? In advanced MS, cognitive decline, like physical decline, cannot be reversed. However, cognitive disorders can be treated with medication and behavioural methods. Donepezil (Aricept®), commonly used in Alzheimer’s disease, has shown a modest effect in several small trials of memory in people with MS. The use of ginko biloba in a small randomised controlled trial reported positive effects on attention and memory for people with MS. Symptom management of fatigue, depression, stress and pain can also have a positive impact on cognition. 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|Clues|to|Identify	MS|Ireland|::|.|Clues|to|Identify|.|What|are|some|clues|to|cognitive|dysfunction|?|Memory|problems|top|the|list|.|Forgetting|names|,|appointments|,|phone|numbers|,|movie|plots|,|what|to|do|next|,|or|what|goes|into|the|favourite|family|recipe|,|are|examples|of|memory|deficits|.|There|can|also|be|difficulty|learning|new|information|and|concentrating|on|a|task|or|conversational|topic|.|Slowed|information|processing|is|also|a|frequent|problem|.|Everything|takes|longer|.|It|may|be|impossible|to|play|games|that|are|time|sensitive|.|Response|time|is|slowed|.|It|may|take|longer|to|shave|,|bathe|and|dress|.|Attention|and|concentration|suffer|.|Inability|to|focus|,|difficulty|following|a|conversation|or|remembering|details|from|a|conversation|,|problems|relating|a|story|,|difficulty|reading|,|concentrating|,|or|following|a|movie|plot|are|examples|of|attention|deficits|.|Being|easily|distracted|and|flitting|from|task|to|task|or|idea|to|idea|are|examples|of|difficulties|with|concentration|.|The|ability|to|multitask|or|shift|between|tasks|becomes|difficult|or|impossible|.|Reasoning|and|problem|solving|difficulties|,|making|poor|decisions|,|and|having|poor|judgment|can|be|difficult|to|recognise|and|more|difficult|to|deal|with|for|Care|Givers|.|Slowness|to|understand|analogies|or|parables|,|difficulty|“|getting|”|jokes|,|taking|things|at|face|value|,|being|literal|or|concrete|,|and|finding|it|difficult|to|analyse|complex|situations|,|are|all|evidence|of|cognitive|decline|.|Executive|functions|such|as|the|ability|to|plan|and|carry|out|a|task|like|planning|a|daughter|’|s|wedding|or|a|holiday|trip|can|be|affected|in|MS|.|Becoming|overwhelmed|by|a|pending|task|can|result|in|confusion|over|where|to|begin|,|and|may|be|associated|with|compensatory|anger|and|withdrawal|.|Visual|perceptual|function|and|spatial|orientation|problems|can|include|difficulty|following|directions|or|programming|a|VCR|,|confusion|over|right|and|left|,|and|difficulty|visualising|how|a|certain|piece|of|adaptive|equipment|could|be|useful|,|even|driving|.|How|can|cognitive|changes|be|managed|in|advanced|MS|?|Are|there|medications|that|can|help|with|cognitive|decline|?|In|advanced|MS|,|cognitive|decline|,|like|physical|decline|,|cannot|be|reversed|.|However|,|cognitive|disorders|can|be|treated|with|medication|and|behavioural|methods|.|Donepezil|(|Aricept|®|)|,|commonly|used|in|Alzheimer|’|s|disease|,|has|shown|a|modest|effect|in|several|small|trials|of|memory|in|people|with|MS|.|The|use|of|ginko|biloba|in|a|small|randomised|controlled|trial|reported|positive|effects|on|attention|and|memory|for|people|with|MS|.|Symptom|management|of|fatigue|,|depression|,|stress|and|pain|can|also|have|a|positive|impact|on|cognition|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4718563852986382601/Current-Analytical-Biomedical-Approaches-to-Global-Health-Threats	Current Analytical Biomedical Approaches to Global Health Threats	Sponsored Content by Pittcon Mar 15 2019. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a report on the “Ten Threats to Global Health in 2019”, which highlighted the main threats to human health across the globe . The comprehensive list comprised an array of well-known threats including non-communicable diseases such as cancer, type-2-diabetes, cardiovascular disease and stroke, as well as emerging threats such as antimicrobial resistance. It may, therefore, come as no surprise that Pittcon 2019 will feature biomedical researchers from around the world who are working diligently to address these important health issues through the development of new techniques and technologies. © Guschenkova/Shutterstock.com. The Pittcon 2019 Technical Program will be held in Philadelphia from March 17 th -21 st 2019 and will showcase a range of biomedical methodologies which can provide improved diagnostics, better treatments, faster discovery and ultimately improved medical outcomes. Spectroscopic approaches to global health threats. Spectroscopy is fast becoming one of the greatest advances in biomedicine. Raman spectroscopy is just one of the many spectroscopic techniques that will be featured at Pittcon 2019. Raman is a low-energy, non-destructive and non-invasive technique that can be used to image even delicate tissues in situ . The only limitation of Raman is the signal to noise ratio, as low energy signals can be swamped and lost in the noise. This has been addressed through the development of combinatorial techniques such as Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS), which has recently been used to image brain tissue in Alzheimer’s disease. Read the full article:. From Bench to Bedside, The Biomedical Techniques Tackling Global Health Threats. Learn more at Pittcon 2019. To demonstrate how Raman spectroscopy can be coupled with photoacoustic imaging. Professor Dan Fu of the University of Washington will present his research at Pittcon 2019 in a talk entitled “Label-Free Chemical Imaging of Brain Structure and Function at Subcellular Resolution”. In this presentation he will show that Stokes Raman Scattering (SRS) is able to detect synaptic acetylcholine, plaque structure, and even complex cell organization without any labelling in Alzheimer’s research. Raman spectroscopy has slipped into biomedical science proving its utility in medical diagnostics for diseases as diverse as cancer, cardiovascular disease and bacterial infections. Raman is proving its value in both the diagnostic laboratory and the clinical environment. Professor Jurgen Popp is a great advocate for Raman spectroscopy and is an expert in his field. He received the 2016 Pittsburgh Spectroscopy Award at Pittcon 2016 and will give a presentation entitled “Clinical Cell and Tissue Diagnostics by Multimodal Molecular Spectroscopy”. This work will examine advances in spectroscopic methods, especially Raman spectroscopy and combinatorial spectroscopic or optical procedures to analyze cells and tissue in pathological samples. Popp will also demonstrate the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a point-of-care method for a fast identification of pathogens. Transmission Raman spectroscopy (TRS) is a further example of a developing biomedical Raman technique. The method works by illuminating the sample on one-side and collecting the transmitted light on the other side. This technique has become a non-invasive technique for the analysis of breast calcification detected from mammograms. Nick Stone, Professor of Biomedical Imaging and Biosensing at the University of Exeter, will present his research paper at Pittcon 2019 entitled “Biomedical Spectroscopic Tools for Rapid Analysis of Disease Specific Changes Using Novel Raman and IR Techniques”. This will show how Raman and IR spectroscopy is being used for the rapid and accurate analysis of tissues in pathology, high-speed spectral histopathology. Microfluidic lab-on-a-chip technology, combined with spectroscopy has the potential to become a new biomedical analytical phenomenon. Microfluidic systems are more cost effective than traditional methods, require minimal training, provide faster results and improved accuracy. Dr Ester Segal of Technion is an expert in microfluidics and will present a talk entitled “On-Chip Rapid Diagnostic Susceptibility Testing of Bacteria and Fungi from Clinical Samples” at Pittcon 2019. This will showcase the testing of microorganisms for antibiotic resistance using a functionalized photonic 2D silicon microarray as a platform. Immunohistochemistry and radiolabelling have revolutionized the visualization and detection of compounds in pathological tissue samples. But now, high-throughput, high-speed MALDI (matrix assisted laser desorbed ionization) mass spectrometry imaging has arrived. MALDI Imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) can be used to analyse complex mixtures ranging from small molecules to complex peptides in a proteome. This method also has the advantage that it does not harm the sample. A recognized authority in mass spectrometry imaging, Professor Pierre Chaurand of the University of Montreal, will present his research in a presentation entitled “Image MS of Tissue Biopsies to Assess Diagnosis, Prognosis and Response to Therapies” at Pittcon 2019. Researchers are continually searching for new biomarkers for health threats, including cancer, neurological diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. If molecular signatures of disease can be identified early then rapid and targeted treatment can improve patient survival providing an economic advantage. A potential method for discovering new biomarkers in lung disease is exhaled breath condensate (EBC). EBC is a body fluid matrix in which biomarkers may be identified and is considered by many to be equivalent to blood, sweat, tears, urine and saliva. A presentation entitled “Human Exhaled Breath Aerosol Collection in the Clinical Setting - Techniques, Concerns, and Considerations” will be provided by Professor Michael D Davis of the Children's Hospital of Richmond, Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The talk will provide an overview of collection techniques and analysis for EBC. An area where biomarkers are needed urgently is Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD is a major public health issue; the condition is the 6 th leading cause of death in the US and around 5.7 million American citizens live with the disease at any one time. Currently, a definitive diagnosis of AD requires post-mortem slides of neural material. It is hoped that a series of new biomarkers will provide a definitive diagnosis for living patients and help scientists to understand the progression of the disease at a molecular level. Two approaches that are currently being utilized for the discovery of new biomarkers are proteomics and lipidomics studies on blood and post-mortem tissues. The potential of these techniques will be outlined by Dr Rena Robinson of Vanderbilt University, who will present her paper at Pittcon 2019, entitled “Comprehensive Proteomics and Lipidomics Strategies to Advance Alzheimer's Disease Research”. This will define a high-throughput quantitative proteomics method to provide hundreds of proteins distinct to specific disease genotypes. Biomarkers and metabolomics. Metabolites are the intermediates and products of metabolism. Cells constantly carry out discrete physiological processes and these can be affected by human disease. To determine the structure and regulation of metabolic pathways is essential especially in brain tissue for researching AD. Monitoring brain chemistry metabolites is, however, a challenging area. In this case, biosensors have been used to understand brain energy metabolism and neurotransmission. The sensors provide timed temporal resolution and enzymatic assaying of any redox or non-redox molecule. This can be of great help in the real-time monitoring of brain chemistry during the course of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, despite the miniature size of the of the biosensors, implantation is often considered dangerous and comes with major health risks. At Pittcon 2019, Dr Stéphane Marinesco of INSERM will give a presentation entitled “Ultra-small Microelectrode Biosensors based on Platinized Carbon Fibers for Brain Injury Monitoring”. This research will demonstrate how ultra-small microelectrodes are implanted in the brain to provide accurate estimates of oxygen, glucose and lactate and other essential compounds. The idea is that this technology could monitor changes occurring in traumatic brain injury and provide improved diagnosis. Biomedical sciences at Pittcon 2019. The technology and research methodology mentioned in this summary will be examined in more detail in the Pittcon 2019 oral and poster presentations, symposia and short technical courses. The Pittcon 2019 guide can provide details of times, venues and biographies of the presenters as well as an abstract of each talk. March 17 - 21. Register for Pittcon 2019.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702815059394732446/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	"I guess the story starts in 2002. I noticed that my right eye had started to go blurry and I went to my mother, A Nurse, to tell her. She started giving me drops to try and clear my eye, but it only got worse as weeks passed. When I told her that I couldn't see at all, we went to an eye doctor for an exam, and he had said that I was suffering form optic neuritis. After going to a few more doctors, I was put on steroids to bring the inflammation down, and it worked, but I noticed that I couldn't see as well as i could before. A few more months passed, and I has hospitalized so i could undergo testing for MS. I was looked at, poked, prodded and given a Lumbar Puncture, Which at 16 terrified me. After a week or so of waiting, the doctor called us in and told us that the tests all came back negative, but she didn't trust them. She told my mother that the LP would come back negative unless I was having an episode when they harvested the spinal fluid. the doctor told us to go to the MS center in our state and there i was given a full neurological exam. After an hour or so of walking, touching my nose and rearing charts, the specialist there, #2 in the state, diagnosed me with MS and explained, in detail, what needed to be done. When I got home, I was in such a fit of depression, that I went into my room, and stayed there for two weeks. During that time, I watched my dreams crumble before my eyes. I focused on all the things that I would no longer be able to do, and visioned the worst of what COULD happen to me. One day, my brother older brother came over and took me out. he showed me that I could still do the thing that I enjoyed, and he showed me that there are different ways to do somethings that I never would have thought about. Time went on as ""normally"" as it could, and my sight got much worse, to the point to where i am legally blind. several years later, my brother was diagnosed with MS also. Now, I cried when I heard that because I didn't want him going through the same things I had. His first year was the hardest for him. I had to help him learn how to avoid hot days and little tricks he could use to keep himself cool if he had to go out. This gave us a new way of bonding and growing closer together. Still, we try to look after each other, when we're not fighting like brothers do, and we each have someone to talk to when the depression hits us, or we just have a bad day. Now a days, I still do things i like, such as swimming, singing and various other activities. MS showed me a new way of looking at things, and is a constant reminder that the word ""can't"" doesn't really exist. It's not ""I can't do this"" It's ""How am I going to do this?"" To any and all who read this, I'm sorry I'm not a better writer, this is just what popped into my head..

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4718034042172132844/I-have-MS-and-my-knees,-without-warning,-buckle;-anyone-else?---Neurology---MedHelp	I have MS and my knees, without warning, buckle; anyone else? - Neurology - MedHelp	"I have MS and my knees, without warning, buckle; anyone else? - Neurology - MedHelp. Hi, my name's Rico. I was in the USAF for 20 years (1981 - 2001); however, I was diagnosed with MS close to the start of my 19th year in the Air Force. Anyway, 4-months after being diagnosed, I was walking around the neighborhood with my wife and daughter. Then, out of nowhere, both my knees buckled at the same time. In a instant, I went from: a standing position; hitting my rear on the sidewalk; a squatting position for a second, or two; then wobbling my arms frantically in a sub-conscience attempt to stand back up straight~which I did. Immediately thereafter, I looked at my wife and daughter and we all began laughing so hard because of how fast everything occurred and what I looked like in my attempt to stand back up. Thinking the episode was nothing more than some kind of weird fluke (my knees never buckled before this in any shape, form or fashion) and after the three of us stopped laughing, we began to resume our walk; problem was though, it happened again. The first two, or so times this happened we all laughed so hard, it's amazing none of us wet ourselves. However, after this continued, my family's smiles quickly disappeared and everyone began to worry. My daughter actually became very anxious and started crying asking me in a very alarming voice, ""What's wrong Pop!?!!"" In a calm voice I told her not to worry, but to run back and get our neighbor to come pick me up. After notifying my neurologist and walking around like a duck for nearly a week (I thought I was on my way to being bedridden), my neurologist came across this (or very similar condition) in one of her MS books. She titled my knee buckling problem as a ""paroxysmal positive motor disturbance"". Her cure was to put me on Dilantin~an anti-seizure medicine. If my memory serves me correctly, I was walking normal again the same day; however, my knees continually buckled regardless of whether, or not I was just standing, or walking. But get this--my knees DO NOT buckle when I run. In regards to the Dilantin; well, once again, relying just on my memory I believe I was on it for three, or four months. Since then (the end of 2000) to present, my knees continue to buckle (whenever they feel like it... lol) I'm standing and walking; but again, THIS DOES NOT happen when I run. Further, I've never been put back on Dilantin (or any other medicine for that matter) for this condition. I came to this site to see if I could find anyone else in the MS community that had the same symptoms I have (my knees buckle spontaneously when I'm walking and standing, but NOT when I'm running).

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4717434693327038337/MS-Transparency:-How-Open-Should-I-Be?---MS-Connection	MS Transparency: How Open Should I Be? - MS Connection	MS Transparency: How Open Should I Be? - MS Connection. Do I walk over and explain to the dude in the garage—the one who’s been giving me the stink eye ever since I pulled into a disabled parking spot—that, while I appear to be healthy, I actually have MS? Do I tell my students what’s going on when I’m pressing my icy drink against my neck to cool me off while I’m teaching inside an overheated classroom, fretting about whether my MS heat sensitivity will flare up? I face these situations quite frequently, wondering whether I should explain my MS to people so they will understand my actions and reactions, or if I should just keep quiet. Four years into my MS odyssey, I haven’t yet found the sweet spot. I’m torn between the concept of total openness about my situation, and just wanting to live my life as best I can without making excuses or explanations for things I cannot control. It’s not as though I’ve hidden my MS from the world. I’ve had pieces published—and shared them on social media—discussing my experiences with the disease. But writing about it is not the same as telling someone in a moment when I’m experiencing something related to my disease, that this is what MS looks like for me today. Do I need to tell the clerk at the grocery store that I’m not intentionally dropping item after item onto the conveyor belt as some sort of indication that I’m impatient with her work; I’m simply having a clumsy MS hands day. Or is that too much to share with someone who’s bagging your onions, orange juice and window cleaner? I admit that my perspective on this subject may be skewed because I spend a lot of time thinking about MS when it interferes with my daily life. People who know I have MS tell me the disease doesn’t automatically come to their minds when we’re interacting because I don’t look sick most of the time. However, I worry that when I cancel plans at the last minute because of fatigue, they won’t understand it’s MS-related (and not laziness) unless I explicitly tell them. I don’t want them to misinterpret the cancelation and think I just don’t want to see them. One of my close friends thinks I should be more open about MS, particularly with my college students. She suggests it would be a great life lesson for them to realize that, as I energetically discuss the day’s news with them, I’m also living with a chronic illness that sometimes affects how I move about in the world. There was one recent day when I almost took her advice. The classroom was getting really warm and uncomfortable. I removed as much clothing as is socially acceptable and sucked down my cool drink (I always bring one to class.) Nevertheless, I started feeling lightheaded, weak, nauseous and as if the speed at which I was processing things mentally was slowing down. I considered explaining why I felt this way. But I chickened out. The students probably would have been fine with the disclosure and would have welcomed a short break. But as I played the scenario out in my head, I envisioned this MS revelation as potentially having a negative effect on teaching evaluations, as emboldening some to challenge grades based on my illness or to question whether MS was the reason it was taking me so long to review their work. In reality, I put in a lot of effort for my students and try to overcompensate for any obstacles MS puts in my way. So, would anything bad really have happened had I told them about the MS? Likely not. But you never know. The closest thing I’ve done to being transparent about my as-of-now invisible disease is to print out two pieces of paper and slide them in the front windshield of my car whenever I use my disabled parking placard. One features a colorful orange “Multiple Sclerosis Awareness” logo, the other features the black and orange logo for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, underneath which I’ve written, “I have MS.” These thin pieces of paper represent the sum total of my attempts to dissuade any would-be nasty-note-writers from tucking a menacing missive beneath my windshield wipers. I’m not sure there is one correct answer. I’m also not sure I should be worrying so much about what people are thinking when I experience an MS symptom or take measures to avoid triggering one (by taking an elevator up a single floor or utilizing disabled parking). However, I am sure of one thing: I am fortunate to have this choice because not everyone with MS does. Deciding what to do and how to react is a privilege. 	1	1	MS|Transparency|:|How|Open|Should|I|Be|?|-|MS|Connection	MS|Transparency|:|How|Open|Should|I|Be|?|-|MS|Connection|.|Do|I|walk|over|and|explain|to|the|dude|in|the|garage|—|the|one|who|’|s|been|giving|me|the|stink|eye|ever|since|I|pulled|into|a|disabled|parking|spot|—|that|,|while|I|appear|to|be|healthy|,|I|actually|have|MS|?|Do|I|tell|my|students|what|’|s|going|on|when|I|’|m|pressing|my|icy|drink|against|my|neck|to|cool|me|off|while|I|’|m|teaching|inside|an|overheated|classroom|,|fretting|about|whether|my|MS|heat|sensitivity|will|flare|up|?|I|face|these|situations|quite|frequently|,|wondering|whether|I|should|explain|my|MS|to|people|so|they|will|understand|my|actions|and|reactions|,|or|if|I|should|just|keep|quiet|.|Four|years|into|my|MS|odyssey|,|I|haven|’|t|yet|found|the|sweet|spot|.|I|’|m|torn|between|the|concept|of|total|openness|about|my|situation|,|and|just|wanting|to|live|my|life|as|best|I|can|without|making|excuses|or|explanations|for|things|I|cannot|control|.|It|’|s|not|as|though|I|’|ve|hidden|my|MS|from|the|world|.|I|’|ve|had|pieces|published|—|and|shared|them|on|social|media|—|discussing|my|experiences|with|the|disease|.|But|writing|about|it|is|not|the|same|as|telling|someone|in|a|moment|when|I|’|m|experiencing|something|related|to|my|disease|,|that|this|is|what|MS|looks|like|for|me|today|.|Do|I|need|to|tell|the|clerk|at|the|grocery|store|that|I|’|m|not|intentionally|dropping|item|after|item|onto|the|conveyor|belt|as|some|sort|of|indication|that|I|’|m|impatient|with|her|work|;|I|’|m|simply|having|a|clumsy|MS|hands|day|.|Or|is|that|too|much|to|share|with|someone|who|’|s|bagging|your|onions|,|orange|juice|and|window|cleaner|?|I|admit|that|my|perspective|on|this|subject|may|be|skewed|because|I|spend|a|lot|of|time|thinking|about|MS|when|it|interferes|with|my|daily|life|.|People|who|know|I|have|MS|tell|me|the|disease|doesn|’|t|automatically|come|to|their|minds|when|we|’|re|interacting|because|I|don|’|t|look|sick|most|of|the|time|.|However|,|I|worry|that|when|I|cancel|plans|at|the|last|minute|because|of|fatigue|,|they|won|’|t|understand|it|’|s|MS-related|(|and|not|laziness|)|unless|I|explicitly|tell|them|.|I|don|’|t|want|them|to|misinterpret|the|cancelation|and|think|I|just|don|’|t|want|to|see|them|.|One|of|my|close|friends|thinks|I|should|be|more|open|about|MS|,|particularly|with|my|college|students|.|She|suggests|it|would|be|a|great|life|lesson|for|them|to|realize|that|,|as|I|energetically|discuss|the|day|’|s|news|with|them|,|I|’|m|also|living|with|a|chronic|illness|that|sometimes|affects|how|I|move|about|in|the|world|.|There|was|one|recent|day|when|I|almost|took|her|advice|.|The|classroom|was|getting|really|warm|and|uncomfortable|.|I|removed|as|much|clothing|as|is|socially|acceptable|and|sucked|down|my|cool|drink|(|I|always|bring|one|to|class|.|)|Nevertheless|,|I|started|feeling|lightheaded|,|weak|,|nauseous|and|as|if|the|speed|at|which|I|was|processing|things|mentally|was|slowing|down|.|I|considered|explaining|why|I|felt|this|way|.|But|I|chickened|out|.|The|students|probably|would|have|been|fine|with|the|disclosure|and|would|have|welcomed|a|short|break|.|But|as|I|played|the|scenario|out|in|my|head|,|I|envisioned|this|MS|revelation|as|potentially|having|a|negative|effect|on|teaching|evaluations|,|as|emboldening|some|to|challenge|grades|based|on|my|illness|or|to|question|whether|MS|was|the|reason|it|was|taking|me|so|long|to|review|their|work|.|In|reality|,|I|put|in|a|lot|of|effort|for|my|students|and|try|to|overcompensate|for|any|obstacles|MS|puts|in|my|way|.|So|,|would|anything|bad|really|have|happened|had|I|told|them|about|the|MS|?|Likely|not|.|But|you|never|know|.|The|closest|thing|I|’|ve|done|to|being|transparent|about|my|as-of-now|invisible|disease|is|to|print|out|two|pieces|of|paper|and|slide|them|in|the|front|windshield|of|my|car|whenever|I|use|my|disabled|parking|placard|.|One|features|a|colorful|orange|“|Multiple|Sclerosis|Awareness|”|logo|,|the|other|features|the|black|and|orange|logo|for|the|National|Multiple|Sclerosis|Society|,|underneath|which|I|’|ve|written|,|“|I|have|MS|.|”|These|thin|pieces|of|paper|represent|the|sum|total|of|my|attempts|to|dissuade|any|would-be|nasty-note-writers|from|tucking|a|menacing|missive|beneath|my|windshield|wipers|.|I|’|m|not|sure|there|is|one|correct|answer|.|I|’|m|also|not|sure|I|should|be|worrying|so|much|about|what|people|are|thinking|when|I|experience|an|MS|symptom|or|take|measures|to|avoid|triggering|one|(|by|taking|an|elevator|up|a|single|floor|or|utilizing|disabled|parking|)|.|However|,|I|am|sure|of|one|thing|:|I|am|fortunate|to|have|this|choice|because|not|everyone|with|MS|does|.|Deciding|what|to|do|and|how|to|react|is|a|privilege|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4718118932222931405/Soft-drink-companies-copy-tobacco-playbook-to-lure-young-users	Soft drink companies copy tobacco playbook to lure young users	"Tobacco conglomerates that used colors, flavors and marketing techniques to entice children as future smokers transferred these same strategies to sweetened beverages when they bought food and drink companies starting in 1963, according to a study by researchers at UC San Francisco. The study, which draws from a cache of previously secret documents from the tobacco industry that is part of the UCSF Industry Documents Library tracked the acquisition and subsequent marketing campaigns of sweetened drink brands by two leading tobacco companies: R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris. It found that as tobacco was facing increased scrutiny from health authorities, its executives transferred the same products and tactics to peddle soft drinks. The study publishes March 14, 2019, in The BMJ . ""Executives in the two largest U.S.-based tobacco companies had developed colors and flavors as additives for cigarettes and used them to build major children's beverage product lines, including Hawaiian Punch, Kool-Aid, Tang and Capri Sun,"" said senior author Laura Schmidt, PhD, MSW, MPH, of the UCSF Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies . ""Even after the tobacco companies sold these brands to food and beverage corporations, many of the product lines and marketing techniques designed to attract kids are still in use today."" Fruit Juice, Sports Drinks Linked to Obesity, Metabolic Disease. American youth currently consume an average of 143 calories a day in sugary beverages, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These calorie-dense drinks do not provide the satiety of foods and are associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that increase the risk for heart disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes. Sugary beverages include most fruit juices, sports and energy drinks, soda and other beverages sweetened with added sugars, including honey, fructose, glucose, sucrose, dextrose, corn sweetener, malt syrup, corn syrup, brown sugar and raw sugar. The new papers, which are available in the UCSF Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library , a subset of the UCSF Industry Documents Library , reveal connections between the tobacco and food industries. Tobacco giant R.J. Reynolds led the transition to sweetened beverages in 1963 when it purchased Hawaiian Punch from Pacific Hawaiian Products Company. The beverage previously had been promoted to adults as a cocktail mixer, but R.J. Reynolds sought to beef up the drink's ""Punchy"" mascot -- a counterpart to the ""Joe Camel"" cartoon character the company used to promote cigarettes -- and featured it on toys, schoolbook covers, comics, tumblers, clothing and TV commercials. Punchy became the ""best salesman the beverage ever had,"" according to tobacco industry documents. In the '60s and '70s, the company conducted taste tests with children and mothers to evaluate sweetness, colors and flavors for Hawaiian Punch product line extensions. The children's preferences were prioritized, the authors noted. By 1983, R.J. Reynolds introduced the nation's first juice box, marketed as a ""handy little carton that comes with its very own straw."" This innovation was largely responsible for a 34 percent jump in sales, according to industry documents. Kool-Aid Joins Marlboro. Meanwhile, tobacco competitor Philip Morris had acquired Kool-Aid, via General Foods, in 1985. The company flipped its marketing audience from families to children, created its ""Kool-Aid Man"" mascot, and launched collaborations with branded toys, including Barbie and Hot Wheels. It also developed a children's Kool-Aid loyalty program described as ""our version of the Marlboro Country Store,"" a cigarette incentives program. ""The Wacky Wild Kool-Aid style campaign had tremendous reach and impact,"" said first author Kim Nguyen, ScD, MPH, who is also with the UCSF Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies. ""Lots of kids in the '80s dreamed of getting swag from the Wacky Warehouse. What is really 'wacky' is that the Kool-Aid kid program was modeled after a tobacco marketing strategy designed to build allegiance with smokers."" By 2004, Philip Morris had developed at least 36 child-tested flavors to its Kool-Aid line, of which some -- like ""Great Bluedini"" -- integrated colors with cartoon characters. The tobacco giant also acquired Capri Sun and Tang, and used similar child-focused integrated marketing strategies to drive those sales. Most sweetened beverage manufacturers claim to limit marketing to children of unhealthy foods and drinks. The industry launched both the Children's Advertising Review Unit, to promote responsible advertising to children through industry self-policing, and the Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, which states that it devotes 100 percent of ""child-directed advertising to better-for-you foods."" ""The industry claims that these tobacco-inspired marketing strategies are not actually targeting children and should be excluded from these industry-led agreements"" said Schmidt. ""But the evidence cited in our research shows that these product lines and marketing techniques were specifically designed for and tested on children."" The authors conclude that, given the current high rates of childhood obesity, there is a clear need to replace current industry-led voluntary standards with well-enforced government regulations on marketing sugary beverages to children. ""Parents do play a significant role in what their kids eat and drink,"" Nguyen said. ""However, we cannot underestimate the influence of these beverage corporations and their marketing. They intentionally develop marketing campaigns that appeal to kids by making the drinks fun and exciting."" The UCSF Industry Documents Library was launched in 2002 as a digital portal for tobacco documents. Today, the library includes close to 15 million internal tobacco, drug, chemical and food industry documents used by scientists, policymakers, journalists and community members in their efforts to improve and protect the health of the public.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4718030056652486282/MS-Ireland--::-Helping-Everyone-Affected-by-Multiple-Sclerosis	MS Ireland  :: Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis	MS Ireland  ::. Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Thursday March 14 2019 10:54 AM. This week we get to share in a conversation between two MS and Me bloggers, Fergal Hughes and Willeke van Eeckhoutte. Read on for their personal take on some of the issues MS brings to their lives . It's tough. Life with MS is tougher than life without MS of course. That said, I doubt that any of us MSers would say our life is tougher than someone else's...anyone else's, MS or no MS! “Walk a mile in someone else's shoes” and all that. Still, MS does have more than its fair share of negative points and it gives us more than our fair share of ‘bad days'. With our new friendship, we ( Willeke van Eeckhoutte and Fergal Hughes ) find we enjoy convincing each other that it's not all bad and that every cloud has a silver lining. WvE: Life with MS put a big exclamation mark in my life... and I wasn't having it! No more hillwalking or thinking of chasing cows in the middle of nowhere only to realise there is a bull just 150 metres ahead of me! FH: Even though some capabilities may have been taken from you, you just need to remind yourself that you can still do what you can do and, well, you'll keep doing it. The goalposts may have been moved – personally, what I now consider to be a major achievement is certainly different to what it was some years ago – but I'm pretty sure you have the confidence and strength to deal with it and adapt. FH: Me, I work as a software engineer. This is both brilliant and not so brilliant. My job requires that I sit down for 8 hours a day. This means there's minimal call for me to be physical but it also means I get minimum chance to be mobile or to work the muscles. Also, my mind has to constantly be in tip-top condition … and with MS that can be a struggle. WvE: My experience is that lately, it seems that my concentration and memory have gone to tatters. My prospective memory especially has led to awkward situations because I agree to do certain tasks, but then I can't remember that I had to remember to perform that task. The intention is there and unless I sticky-tape notes to every wall of the house, I often find myself apologising. WvE: This is no joke. It takes 100% true grit trying to stay awake for five minutes once I put my head on my pillow. Can you imagine having a relationship like this? I have to watch episodes of my favourite shows five or six times to see the whole 45-minute program! What's your secret, Fergal? FH: Combatting fatigue is no easy matter, Willeke. I've found that a regular schedule for going to bed at a particular time every evening and getting up at roughly the same time every morning helps me … as long as I stick to it! As long as I give my body and mind the best possible chance , the closer to a ‘normal life' I get. FH: I'm a worrier. It's alright saying I live in the 'here and now' but shouldn't I at least consider the worst possible future … so I'll be prepared for it if it did happen. WvE: As a great philosopher once said, ‘Don't worry, be happy'. But hey, always remember, you can't control the future. You can maybe have an effect on today and this week but let the long-term future take care of itself. A BURDEN ON OTHERS. WvE: I feel shut out when people tell me I don't need to worry about certain news, that I have enough on my mind already. I tell them again and again that they don't need to worry about what I live with, but I cannot convince them. Backup or tips needed here, Fergal! FH: No one wants to feel like a burden on family or friends. But come on, Willeke, we can't control how others feel. And anyway, we might be wrong! I KNEW I WAS DEPRESSED BUT WAS AFRAID OF REACHING OUT. FH: I waited too long to get help and felt there wasn't much support available in my community. When I eventually found a therapist, it was expensive enough for the amount of time I was given. WvE: I'm sorry to hear that Fergal. People with MS need more readily available access to mental health services. Once I opened up, I felt relief knowing I was not the only one. Therapists might have group sessions also for ‘people with chronic illnesses'. 	1	1	MS|Ireland|::|Helping|Everyone|Affected|by|Multiple|Sclerosis	MS|Ireland|::|.|Helping|Everyone|Affected|by|Multiple|Sclerosis|.|Thursday|March|14|2019|10:54|AM|.|This|week|we|get|to|share|in|a|conversation|between|two|MS|and|Me|bloggers|,|Fergal|Hughes|and|Willeke|van|Eeckhoutte|.|Read|on|for|their|personal|take|on|some|of|the|issues|MS|brings|to|their|lives|.|It's|tough|.|Life|with|MS|is|tougher|than|life|without|MS|of|course|.|That|said|,|I|doubt|that|any|of|us|MSers|would|say|our|life|is|tougher|than|someone|else's|...|anyone|else's|,|MS|or|no|MS|!|“|Walk|a|mile|in|someone|else's|shoes|”|and|all|that|.|Still|,|MS|does|have|more|than|its|fair|share|of|negative|points|and|it|gives|us|more|than|our|fair|share|of|‘|bad|days|'|.|With|our|new|friendship|,|we|(|Willeke|van|Eeckhoutte|and|Fergal|Hughes|)|find|we|enjoy|convincing|each|other|that|it's|not|all|bad|and|that|every|cloud|has|a|silver|lining|.|WvE|:|Life|with|MS|put|a|big|exclamation|mark|in|my|life|...|and|I|wasn't|having|it|!|No|more|hillwalking|or|thinking|of|chasing|cows|in|the|middle|of|nowhere|only|to|realise|there|is|a|bull|just|150|metres|ahead|of|me|!|FH|:|Even|though|some|capabilities|may|have|been|taken|from|you|,|you|just|need|to|remind|yourself|that|you|can|still|do|what|you|can|do|and|,|well|,|you'll|keep|doing|it|.|The|goalposts|may|have|been|moved|–|personally|,|what|I|now|consider|to|be|a|major|achievement|is|certainly|different|to|what|it|was|some|years|ago|–|but|I'm|pretty|sure|you|have|the|confidence|and|strength|to|deal|with|it|and|adapt|.|FH|:|Me|,|I|work|as|a|software|engineer|.|This|is|both|brilliant|and|not|so|brilliant|.|My|job|requires|that|I|sit|down|for|8|hours|a|day|.|This|means|there's|minimal|call|for|me|to|be|physical|but|it|also|means|I|get|minimum|chance|to|be|mobile|or|to|work|the|muscles|.|Also|,|my|mind|has|to|constantly|be|in|tip-top|condition|…|and|with|MS|that|can|be|a|struggle|.|WvE|:|My|experience|is|that|lately|,|it|seems|that|my|concentration|and|memory|have|gone|to|tatters|.|My|prospective|memory|especially|has|led|to|awkward|situations|because|I|agree|to|do|certain|tasks|,|but|then|I|can't|remember|that|I|had|to|remember|to|perform|that|task|.|The|intention|is|there|and|unless|I|sticky-tape|notes|to|every|wall|of|the|house|,|I|often|find|myself|apologising|.|WvE|:|This|is|no|joke|.|It|takes|100|%|true|grit|trying|to|stay|awake|for|five|minutes|once|I|put|my|head|on|my|pillow|.|Can|you|imagine|having|a|relationship|like|this|?|I|have|to|watch|episodes|of|my|favourite|shows|five|or|six|times|to|see|the|whole|45|-|minute|program|!|What's|your|secret|,|Fergal|?|FH|:|Combatting|fatigue|is|no|easy|matter|,|Willeke|.|I've|found|that|a|regular|schedule|for|going|to|bed|at|a|particular|time|every|evening|and|getting|up|at|roughly|the|same|time|every|morning|helps|me|…|as|long|as|I|stick|to|it|!|As|long|as|I|give|my|body|and|mind|the|best|possible|chance|,|the|closer|to|a|‘|normal|life|'|I|get|.|FH|:|I'm|a|worrier|.|It's|alright|saying|I|live|in|the|'|here|and|now|'|but|shouldn't|I|at|least|consider|the|worst|possible|future|…|so|I'll|be|prepared|for|it|if|it|did|happen|.|WvE|:|As|a|great|philosopher|once|said|,|‘|Don't|worry|,|be|happy|'|.|But|hey|,|always|remember|,|you|can't|control|the|future|.|You|can|maybe|have|an|effect|on|today|and|this|week|but|let|the|long-term|future|take|care|of|itself|.|A|BURDEN|ON|OTHERS|.|WvE|:|I|feel|shut|out|when|people|tell|me|I|don't|need|to|worry|about|certain|news|,|that|I|have|enough|on|my|mind|already|.|I|tell|them|again|and|again|that|they|don't|need|to|worry|about|what|I|live|with|,|but|I|cannot|convince|them|.|Backup|or|tips|needed|here|,|Fergal|!|FH|:|No|one|wants|to|feel|like|a|burden|on|family|or|friends|.|But|come|on|,|Willeke|,|we|can't|control|how|others|feel|.|And|anyway|,|we|might|be|wrong|!|I|KNEW|I|WAS|DEPRESSED|BUT|WAS|AFRAID|OF|REACHING|OUT|.|FH|:|I|waited|too|long|to|get|help|and|felt|there|wasn't|much|support|available|in|my|community|.|When|I|eventually|found|a|therapist|,|it|was|expensive|enough|for|the|amount|of|time|I|was|given|.|WvE|:|I'm|sorry|to|hear|that|Fergal|.|People|with|MS|need|more|readily|available|access|to|mental|health|services|.|Once|I|opened|up|,|I|felt|relief|knowing|I|was|not|the|only|one|.|Therapists|might|have|group|sessions|also|for|‘|people|with|chronic|illnesses|'|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4717442581055814470/Stephen-Hawking's-former-nurse-banned-from-practice-in-United-Kingdom	Stephen Hawking's former nurse banned from practice in United Kingdom	"Stephen Hawking's former nurse banned from practicing over care for late physicist. Ryan W. Miller USA TODAY. Published 8:40 PM EDT Mar 12, 2019. A former nurse for Stephen Hawking was banned from practicing in the United Kingdom after regulators found she ""failed to provide the standards of good, professional care"" for the late theoretical physicist. Patricia Dowdy, a registered nurse, faced multiple misconduct charges related to her care of Hawking, including financial misconduct, dishonesty, not providing appropriate care, not cooperating with regulators and not having the correct qualifications, the U.K.'s Nursing and Midwifery Council announced Tuesday. ""As the public rightly expects, in serious cases such as this – where a nurse has failed in their duty of care and has not been able to evidence to the panel that they have learned from their mistakes and be fit to practise – we will take action,"" Matthew McClelland, the NMCs director of fitness to practice said in a statement. ""We have remained in close contact with the Hawking family throughout this case and I am grateful to them – as they approach the anniversary of Professor Hawking’s death – and others for sharing their concerns with us. My thoughts are with the family at this difficult time,"" McClelland added. Hawking died a year ago, on March 14, 2018, at age 76. For decades, the world-renowned scientist lived with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s Disease, a neurological disease that handcuffs movement. But Hawking's longevity stunned many medical experts. ALS can kill someone within a few months of diagnosis, and there's only a 10 percent chance patients live more than a decade, the ALS Association says. More: Stephen Hawking auction: Wheelchair and thesis sell for over $1 million. More: Stephen Hawking wrote 'there is no God' in his final book. It's not the first time he's shared that belief. The Associated Press reported that Dowdy worked for Hawking from 1999 to 2004 and again from July 2013 until receiving an interim suspension in March 2016. ""The Hawking family are relieved this traumatic ordeal has now concluded and that as a result of the verdict, others will not have to go through what they suffered from this individual,"" the family said in a statement, the AP reported.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4716933960767226982/Could-I-Have-MS?	Could I Have MS?	Hello all,. I'll try to keep this brief. A week and a half ago a shelter house in our yard blew into our neighbor's yard and I had to go take it down and move it. Our neighbor was a very stressful experience as he was swearing at me and very angry. Then later in the day I was lifting 25 pound concrete blocks and at one point carried one on a shoulder. A couple of hours later I started making dinner and my feet/legs started getting tingling/burning/muscle soreness feeling. The next day my upper back, shoulders, arms, and hands were also experiencing the same symptoms and it's continued every day since then. On Sunday I wore heels and my sciatica went crazy for about 24 hours. I've had that for over 20 years but normally it doesn't act up unless I do something to irritate it. So these symptoms come and go throughout the day, and go away completely at night. If I'm laying down and very relaxed they are almost gone as well. If I am relaxed in general they are better. I'll wake up in the morning and feel normal and then the symptoms will start again. I'm a full-time student so I sit/use my hands a lot. These sensations and aches are worse when I'm sitting, typing, writing, or driving. If I change positions or walk or move in some way then the sensations/aches will get better. Then today the front of my tongue feels tingly. So that has me worried. I am under a lot of stress. Does this sound like it could be MS or is this a combination of stress/injury from all the lifting I did? 	1	0	Could|I|Have|MS|?

I'm not sure about disability benefits but I have heard the lack of write offs is supposedly offset by a higher basic deduction? I haven't gotten mine back from the accountant but I think I liked all the deductions better. Yeah; I'm not concerned about ""write-offs"". I don't itemize my deductions so they don't affect me. And, yes; there is a larger standard deduction this year. That doesn't explain why my disability benefit is taxed at a much higher rate this year. An SSDI disability benefit is income.

A first study tested VX-445 combined with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in people with cystic fibrosis who have an F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation, whereas a second study compared this triple-combination modulator to tezacaftor/ivacaftor in people with two copies of the F508del mutation. Both studies showed an improvement in lung function. After the completion of the ongoing Phase 3 trials, Vertex will decide which one of two potential triple-combination therapies will be put forward to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval. If approved, a triple combination has the potential to eventually benefit more than 90 percent of people with CF. This would be an incredible step toward our goal of ensuring that all people with CF have effective treatments and, ultimately, a cure. 	0	0	MS|Views|and|News|::|Cystic|Fibrosis|Breaking|News	March|6|,|2019|This|morning|,|VX|-|445|plus|tezacaftor|/|ivacaftor|(|Symdeko|®|)|.|A|first|study|tested|VX|-|445|combined|with|tezacaftor|/|ivacaftor|in|people|with|cystic|fibrosis|who|have|an|F508del|mutation|and|a|minimal|function|mutation|,|whereas|a|second|study|compared|this|triple-combination|modulator|to|tezacaftor|/|ivacaftor|in|people|with|two|copies|of|the|F508del|mutation|.|Both|studies|showed|an|improvement|in|lung|function|.|After|the|completion|of|the|ongoing|Phase|3|trials|,|Vertex|will|decide|which|one|of|two|potential|triple-combination|therapies|will|be|put|forward|to|the|U|.|S|.|Food|and|Drug|Administration|(|FDA|)|for|approval|.|If|approved|,|a|triple|combination|has|the|potential|to|eventually|benefit|more|than|90|percent|of|people|with|CF|.|This|would|be|an|incredible|step|toward|our|goal|of|ensuring|that|all|people|with|CF|have|effective|treatments|and|,|ultimately|,|a|cure|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4708828578289378806/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	"At the age of 26 I had started to have problems with my vision. Thinking that I just needed a new pair of glasses, I went to a local Optician. My new glasses didn't help & my vision got worse. My Oncologist sent me to a vision specialist. That was where I found out that I had severe issues with my Optic nerves. I began to have other symptoms such as numbness, clumsiness, and abnormal fatigue. He suggested an MRI of my brain. That led to a Lumbar puncture which led to my diagnosis. That was 15 years ago & I have learned a lot about MS in general and how it affects me in particular. After trying various drugs with worsening side effects, I now know that what works for me is a nutritional approach. No Gluten, meat, dairy, or processed foods. One of my favorite sayings is ""When the side effects become worse than the disease, it's time to stop your therapy & look for something else."" Has this cured me? Of course not.

After diagnosis I started on Copaxone as I am not willing to take anything else. For the next 2 years my life got back to normal and I forgot that I had MS. My husband deployed in January of 2013, I took 17 credit hours, homeschooled our children among other things, and misssed about 30 days of medicine. We are also eating fast food most nights (and I wasn't eating much at all) I lost 8 pounds which took me down to 112. Then MS reminded me that it was still there. I had two back to back relapses and a new brainstem lesion. My husband came home on emergency leave to situated myself and the children with my family in Wyoming. Two rounds of Solumedrol and 2 months of prednisone and I am back to feeling almost normal. I am taking my Copaxone everyday now! I have slowed way down! Changed to the Swank diet, exercise, and yoga. My teachers were nice enough to give me incompletes and I have had the summer to complete the courses. One more to go. I'm 30 hrs from my bachelors but I am not going to return to college in the fall. Mostly because I'm scared. However, God has been with me the whole time. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	MS|began|affecting|my|life|in|2011|right|after|my|husband|returned|from|deployment|in|April|.|After|diagnosis|I|started|on|Copaxone|as|I|am|not|willing|to|take|anything|else|.|For|the|next|2|years|my|life|got|back|to|normal|and|I|forgot|that|I|had|MS|.|My|husband|deployed|in|January|of|2013|,|I|took|17|credit|hours|,|homeschooled|our|children|among|other|things|,|and|misssed|about|30|days|of|medicine|.|We|are|also|eating|fast|food|most|nights|(|and|I|wasn't|eating|much|at|all|)|I|lost|8|pounds|which|took|me|down|to|112|.|Then|MS|reminded|me|that|it|was|still|there|.|I|had|two|back|to|back|relapses|and|a|new|brainstem|lesion|.|My|husband|came|home|on|emergency|leave|to|situated|myself|and|the|children|with|my|family|in|Wyoming|.|Two|rounds|of|Solumedrol|and|2|months|of|prednisone|and|I|am|back|to|feeling|almost|normal|.|I|am|taking|my|Copaxone|everyday|now|!|I|have|slowed|way|down|!|Changed|to|the|Swank|diet|,|exercise|,|and|yoga|.|My|teachers|were|nice|enough|to|give|me|incompletes|and|I|have|had|the|summer|to|complete|the|courses|.|One|more|to|go|.|I'm|30|hrs|from|my|bachelors|but|I|am|not|going|to|return|to|college|in|the|fall|.|Mostly|because|I'm|scared|.|However|,|God|has|been|with|me|the|whole|time|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4708828561584932458/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	I was diagnosed in April 2012. I first had chest pain but knew that it was not a heart attack. The pain came and went for over 24 hours. I went to the Everett Clinic and they did an EKG. Everything was normal. Within a week, I started to have vision problems (i.e., blurred and double vision). The doctors believed that the symptoms were not related and said to go to the optometrist. Then, the optometrist referred me to an ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologist saw something and ordered an MRI. The MRI showed signs of MS and referred me to a neurologist. At this time, I also had vertigo and motion sickness. I was diagnosed and spent three days getting an IV of steroids. After a week, I was normal again. All the symptoms were related to the MS. When I first was diagnosed, I was scared. My daughter was almost a year old. I did not know what to do. My neurologist said the best thing to do was to research and become an expert on MS. I started reading books and going to the gym more. I have found the more I work out the better I feel. This past year my family and I participated in the Walk MS in Snohomish County. My aunt, who passed away a couple years ago from lung cancer, also had MS but she did not talk about it because she had other issues as well. My family and I walked for her and our children. Life is better than when I was first diagnosed. I'm finishing my bachelor degree in business and taking control of my life. I tend to be a little bit more isolated than I used to be. Once my last class is finished, I am looking forward to spending time with my daughter, family, and friends. I love to hike and camp, so I need to get my hiking gear ready. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	I|was|diagnosed|in|April|2012|.|I|first|had|chest|pain|but|knew|that|it|was|not|a|heart|attack|.|The|pain|came|and|went|for|over|24|hours|.|I|went|to|the|Everett|Clinic|and|they|did|an|EKG|.|Everything|was|normal|.|Within|a|week|,|I|started|to|have|vision|problems|(|i|.|e|.|,|blurred|and|double|vision|)|.|The|doctors|believed|that|the|symptoms|were|not|related|and|said|to|go|to|the|optometrist|.|Then|,|the|optometrist|referred|me|to|an|ophthalmologist|.|The|ophthalmologist|saw|something|and|ordered|an|MRI|.|The|MRI|showed|signs|of|MS|and|referred|me|to|a|neurologist|.|At|this|time|,|I|also|had|vertigo|and|motion|sickness|.|I|was|diagnosed|and|spent|three|days|getting|an|IV|of|steroids|.|After|a|week|,|I|was|normal|again|.|All|the|symptoms|were|related|to|the|MS|.|When|I|first|was|diagnosed|,|I|was|scared|.|My|daughter|was|almost|a|year|old|.|I|did|not|know|what|to|do|.|My|neurologist|said|the|best|thing|to|do|was|to|research|and|become|an|expert|on|MS|.|I|started|reading|books|and|going|to|the|gym|more|.|I|have|found|the|more|I|work|out|the|better|I|feel|.|This|past|year|my|family|and|I|participated|in|the|Walk|MS|in|Snohomish|County|.|My|aunt|,|who|passed|away|a|couple|years|ago|from|lung|cancer|,|also|had|MS|but|she|did|not|talk|about|it|because|she|had|other|issues|as|well|.|My|family|and|I|walked|for|her|and|our|children|.|Life|is|better|than|when|I|was|first|diagnosed|.|I'm|finishing|my|bachelor|degree|in|business|and|taking|control|of|my|life|.|I|tend|to|be|a|little|bit|more|isolated|than|I|used|to|be|.|Once|my|last|class|is|finished|,|I|am|looking|forward|to|spending|time|with|my|daughter|,|family|,|and|friends|.|I|love|to|hike|and|camp|,|so|I|need|to|get|my|hiking|gear|ready|.

My biggest challenge is my self confidence with battling my symptoms and feeling misunderstood by those around me including my own family. I also struggle the most with having enough energy to complete daily functions and try to remain active and social. My hope and dream is to get stable and well enough to get out of the house more and engage with others and participate in new activities to make new friends and connections.

After being in the hospital for a week (me lying in a hospital bed, laughing because I had no idea what was going on and how I thought a ""spinal tap"" tickled, I was diagnosed with MS in April of 2005. My neurologist told me that I would probably be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of my life.... but I proved him wrong. (Symptom free since 2007, back to normal :) ) Overall, I believe having MS and how you deal with the diagnosis depends on your attitude towards it.

Take a look at this study. There's another study that states CBD can produce beneficial effects in AD, PD and MS patients here. I would not recommend products that use CBD isolate (or low dosage under 1000mg/oz) as it is an inferior product and you wouldn't get all the cannabinoids that using the whole plant does. If you're looking for a pharmacy-quality high potency CBD oil, Zion Medicinals uses US organic hemp and extracts the whole plant for a full spectrum for better bioavailability and a higher potency product.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4703875468334008136/MS-Ireland--::-Providing-Care	MS Ireland  :: Providing Care	MS Ireland  ::. Caring for someone with MS can be deeply satisfying. Partners, family, and friends can be drawn more closely together when they meet the challenges. But care giving can also be physically and emotionally exhausting, especially for the person who is the primary caregiver. That person is most often a partner or spouse, but can also be a child, parent, or friend. There are a wide range of care giving activities, just as there are a wide range of abilities and disabilities among people with MS. Someone who is a Care Giver to a person who has relatively few functional difficulties may be helping with injections of a disease-modifying drug and offering support in dealing with the medical team. Someone who is a Care Giver for a person with a more severe level of disability may be involved in daily activities like toileting, dressing, transferring, and feeding, as well as medical treatments. How can you improve the quality of care you provide? What changes (if any) need to be made? Here are some guidelines for evaluating your role in the ongoing care process:. Obviously, perfect balance is impossible, and probably not even desirable. But you should look for times where you can “make room for yourself,” and get some perspective. Remember to be a Care Giver for yourself, too. 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|Providing|Care	MS|Ireland|::|.|Caring|for|someone|with|MS|can|be|deeply|satisfying|.|Partners|,|family|,|and|friends|can|be|drawn|more|closely|together|when|they|meet|the|challenges|.|But|care|giving|can|also|be|physically|and|emotionally|exhausting|,|especially|for|the|person|who|is|the|primary|caregiver|.|That|person|is|most|often|a|partner|or|spouse|,|but|can|also|be|a|child|,|parent|,|or|friend|.|There|are|a|wide|range|of|care|giving|activities|,|just|as|there|are|a|wide|range|of|abilities|and|disabilities|among|people|with|MS|.|Someone|who|is|a|Care|Giver|to|a|person|who|has|relatively|few|functional|difficulties|may|be|helping|with|injections|of|a|disease-modifying|drug|and|offering|support|in|dealing|with|the|medical|team|.|Someone|who|is|a|Care|Giver|for|a|person|with|a|more|severe|level|of|disability|may|be|involved|in|daily|activities|like|toileting|,|dressing|,|transferring|,|and|feeding|,|as|well|as|medical|treatments|.|How|can|you|improve|the|quality|of|care|you|provide|?|What|changes|(|if|any|)|need|to|be|made|?|Here|are|some|guidelines|for|evaluating|your|role|in|the|ongoing|care|process|:|.|Obviously|,|perfect|balance|is|impossible|,|and|probably|not|even|desirable|.|But|you|should|look|for|times|where|you|can|“|make|room|for|yourself|,|”|and|get|some|perspective|.|Remember|to|be|a|Care|Giver|for|yourself|,|too|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4703875410451792690/MS-Ireland--::-Dietician	MS Ireland  :: Dietician	MS Ireland  ::. A dietitian provides a high-quality therapeutic and nutritional advisory service to improve a person's health. This may be done within the hospital setting as part of a multi-professional team or within the community. A healthy diet is important for everyone and many people with MS find it a good way to manage their health. A healthy, balanced diet, combined with the right exercise, can help to:. Many different diet therapies have been advocated in the management of MS. Some people feel specialist diets make a difference to how they feel, perhaps by reducing relapse rate or improving their overall quality of life; others don’t feel this way. At the moment, there isn’t any conclusive evidence to suggest they are effective. Following one of these diets is an individual choice – but if you do decide to try a new diet, it’s important to make sure you still get enough energy and all your essential nutrients. You should speak to a dietitian before making any major changes to your diet, particularly if you have any other health conditions which might also affect your dietary needs. In some centres, dietitians work as part of a multi-disciplinary team in the care of those with MS. In this situation, one may access the dietician while attending the multi-disciplinary MS clinic. Otherwise, a dietitian will be available through referral from the hospital consultant. You can also contact a private dietitian via the website of the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute. Dietitian or nutritionist? It is important to understand the difference between a dietitian, a nutritionist and a nutritional therapist. Many people claim to be experts in nutrition yet have very limited knowledge and do not offer protection to the public. Choosing the right person from whom to seek help and advice can sometimes be a confusing task. This is not helped by an increasing number of self- proclaimed or alternative ‘nutrition practitioners’ emerging from informal courses. Such courses are not recognised by the State or by Irish Universities. Further information and advice on choosing a qualified practitioner can be found on the website of the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute. 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|Dietician	MS|Ireland|::|.|A|dietitian|provides|a|high-quality|therapeutic|and|nutritional|advisory|service|to|improve|a|person's|health|.|This|may|be|done|within|the|hospital|setting|as|part|of|a|multi-professional|team|or|within|the|community|.|A|healthy|diet|is|important|for|everyone|and|many|people|with|MS|find|it|a|good|way|to|manage|their|health|.|A|healthy|,|balanced|diet|,|combined|with|the|right|exercise|,|can|help|to|:|.|Many|different|diet|therapies|have|been|advocated|in|the|management|of|MS|.|Some|people|feel|specialist|diets|make|a|difference|to|how|they|feel|,|perhaps|by|reducing|relapse|rate|or|improving|their|overall|quality|of|life|;|others|don|’|t|feel|this|way|.|At|the|moment|,|there|isn|’|t|any|conclusive|evidence|to|suggest|they|are|effective|.|Following|one|of|these|diets|is|an|individual|choice|–|but|if|you|do|decide|to|try|a|new|diet|,|it|’|s|important|to|make|sure|you|still|get|enough|energy|and|all|your|essential|nutrients|.|You|should|speak|to|a|dietitian|before|making|any|major|changes|to|your|diet|,|particularly|if|you|have|any|other|health|conditions|which|might|also|affect|your|dietary|needs|.|In|some|centres|,|dietitians|work|as|part|of|a|multi-disciplinary|team|in|the|care|of|those|with|MS|.|In|this|situation|,|one|may|access|the|dietician|while|attending|the|multi-disciplinary|MS|clinic|.|Otherwise|,|a|dietitian|will|be|available|through|referral|from|the|hospital|consultant|.|You|can|also|contact|a|private|dietitian|via|the|website|of|the|Irish|Nutrition|and|Dietetic|Institute|.|Dietitian|or|nutritionist|?|It|is|important|to|understand|the|difference|between|a|dietitian|,|a|nutritionist|and|a|nutritional|therapist|.|Many|people|claim|to|be|experts|in|nutrition|yet|have|very|limited|knowledge|and|do|not|offer|protection|to|the|public|.|Choosing|the|right|person|from|whom|to|seek|help|and|advice|can|sometimes|be|a|confusing|task|.|This|is|not|helped|by|an|increasing|number|of|self|-|proclaimed|or|alternative|‘|nutrition|practitioners|’|emerging|from|informal|courses|.|Such|courses|are|not|recognised|by|the|State|or|by|Irish|Universities|.|Further|information|and|advice|on|choosing|a|qualified|practitioner|can|be|found|on|the|website|of|the|Irish|Nutrition|and|Dietetic|Institute|.

Since changing from cows milk to almond/soya/oat milks + soya yogurts at breakfast back in November 2018 my husbands regular morning ‘off periods’ which lasted for between 60 and 90 minutes EVERY morning for several years have completely disappeared. I have recently spoken to a nutricianist who informed me that it is a well know fact that giving up dairy products helps with all neurological diseases such as PD,MS etc. Hope that helps, I always think that anything is worth a try. Also, on the advice found on this website he also has a teaspoon of Mucuna Prurians powder in soya milk first thing each morning, this is a natural form of dopamine, I buy it online from Indigo Herbs Ltd. 	0	0	Anyone|changed|their|diet|?

I don't have the answer to your question, however, I am wondering if you are taking this for depression or for sleep? I recently had a sleep study and that doc wants me to take amitripyline as a sleep aid at night...not sure of the dose, he did say that it would be a lower dose then is used for depression? Hello, I am on amitripline 150 mgs per night for fibromyalgia. And yes, sometimes certain foods taste disgusting, that bitter taste. I have also noticed, anything that has a acid base to it, like ketchup, dill pickles, green olives and etc is nasty. I have been maxed out on the medication since March of 2017, I certainly hope that this with the foods tasting bitter gets better soon. Hi there... I take the same at 10mg low dose for pain... Plus I take it at night to help fall asleep... I was prescribed this for pain... Have muscle spasm like pain through my back, legs arms and neck... Dx fibromyalgia.. The taste does get better over time so hang tight... And i take it like 3 hours before bed or I will be groggy in the morning... girl - I am takingit for pain and the idea being it will help me sleep, whichit does to some degree. But I still get woken some nights by cramp. Dawnym - thanks I keep going, I'm not groggy in the morning, infact with all the drugs I have been given my body has adapted well it normally only take 48 hours of feeling a bit odd and then I'm fine (may this is the same reason as they are having little effect too.). I must stop eating though! I had been on amitriptyline since March to help me sleep and for nerve pain. I was only on 10m.g and it certainly helped. I found I had a dry mouth and needed to drink more water in the day than usual. I have just very slowly come off it as I feel it made me put on weight. However I have only been off it for a few days and am aware that I am not sleeping so well so am reserving judgment about whether I need to remain on it. My Consultant was happy for me to work out for myself what I need and he did say that I could just take it now and then if I needed a good night's sleep. Amitriptyline is used for depression, chronic pain, sometimes headaches, and sleep so I would think its a good choice for some folks with MS. With some meds with bad taste it helps to swallow it in a huge gump of applesauce instead of water. Prednisone leaves a bad taste for me for hours and when I use applesauce I dont notice it. I have been taking amitriptyline since November 2015 and still have this horrible tainted taste. I too try to eat anything that will take it away. I am a huge salad lover but cannot stand it at the moment as it tastes wrong. I am on a dose of 75mg nightly for depression, nerve pain and sleep. I am contemplating changing medication as this tainted taste is driving me crazy! Nothing gets rid of it. I'm drinking at least 2L of water over s 24hr period for dry mouth too. I do have this awful taste and it lasts all day. I have only been on it for a few weeks and sometimes it helps me sleep. I have fibromyalgia. I was taking Lycria for damaged nerves in my hand and an anti depressant but since I have stopped taking the anti depressant, my mood is really bad, angry all the time. I just wonder if it is worthwhile taking the new one. 	0	0	Amitriptyline|...|bad|taste|!|-|Multiple|Sclerosis|-|MedHelp	Amitriptyline|...|bad|taste|!|-|Multiple|Sclerosis|-|MedHelp|.|I|don't|have|the|answer|to|your|question|,|however|,|I|am|wondering|if|you|are|taking|this|for|depression|or|for|sleep|?|I|recently|had|a|sleep|study|and|that|doc|wants|me|to|take|amitripyline|as|a|sleep|aid|at|night|...|not|sure|of|the|dose|,|he|did|say|that|it|would|be|a|lower|dose|then|is|used|for|depression|?|Hello|,|I|am|on|amitripline|150|mgs|per|night|for|fibromyalgia|.|And|yes|,|sometimes|certain|foods|taste|disgusting|,|that|bitter|taste|.|I|have|also|noticed|,|anything|that|has|a|acid|base|to|it|,|like|ketchup|,|dill|pickles|,|green|olives|and|etc|is|nasty|.|I|have|been|maxed|out|on|the|medication|since|March|of|2017|,|I|certainly|hope|that|this|with|the|foods|tasting|bitter|gets|better|soon|.|Hi|there|...|I|take|the|same|at|10mg|low|dose|for|pain|...|Plus|I|take|it|at|night|to|help|fall|asleep|...|I|was|prescribed|this|for|pain|...|Have|muscle|spasm|like|pain|through|my|back|,|legs|arms|and|neck|...|Dx|fibromyalgia|..|The|taste|does|get|better|over|time|so|hang|tight|...|And|i|take|it|like|3|hours|before|bed|or|I|will|be|groggy|in|the|morning|...|girl|-|I|am|takingit|for|pain|and|the|idea|being|it|will|help|me|sleep|,|whichit|does|to|some|degree|.|But|I|still|get|woken|some|nights|by|cramp|.|Dawnym|-|thanks|I|keep|going|,|I'm|not|groggy|in|the|morning|,|infact|with|all|the|drugs|I|have|been|given|my|body|has|adapted|well|it|normally|only|take|48|hours|of|feeling|a|bit|odd|and|then|I'm|fine|(|may|this|is|the|same|reason|as|they|are|having|little|effect|too|.|)|.|I|must|stop|eating|though|!|I|had|been|on|amitriptyline|since|March|to|help|me|sleep|and|for|nerve|pain|.|I|was|only|on|10m|.|g|and|it|certainly|helped|.|I|found|I|had|a|dry|mouth|and|needed|to|drink|more|water|in|the|day|than|usual|.|I|have|just|very|slowly|come|off|it|as|I|feel|it|made|me|put|on|weight|.|However|I|have|only|been|off|it|for|a|few|days|and|am|aware|that|I|am|not|sleeping|so|well|so|am|reserving|judgment|about|whether|I|need|to|remain|on|it|.|My|Consultant|was|happy|for|me|to|work|out|for|myself|what|I|need|and|he|did|say|that|I|could|just|take|it|now|and|then|if|I|needed|a|good|night's|sleep|.|Amitriptyline|is|used|for|depression|,|chronic|pain|,|sometimes|headaches|,|and|sleep|so|I|would|think|its|a|good|choice|for|some|folks|with|MS|.|With|some|meds|with|bad|taste|it|helps|to|swallow|it|in|a|huge|gump|of|applesauce|instead|of|water|.|Prednisone|leaves|a|bad|taste|for|me|for|hours|and|when|I|use|applesauce|I|dont|notice|it|.|I|have|been|taking|amitriptyline|since|November|2015|and|still|have|this|horrible|tainted|taste|.|I|too|try|to|eat|anything|that|will|take|it|away|.|I|am|a|huge|salad|lover|but|cannot|stand|it|at|the|moment|as|it|tastes|wrong|.|I|am|on|a|dose|of|75mg|nightly|for|depression|,|nerve|pain|and|sleep|.|I|am|contemplating|changing|medication|as|this|tainted|taste|is|driving|me|crazy|!|Nothing|gets|rid|of|it|.|I'm|drinking|at|least|2L|of|water|over|s|24hr|period|for|dry|mouth|too|.|I|do|have|this|awful|taste|and|it|lasts|all|day|.|I|have|only|been|on|it|for|a|few|weeks|and|sometimes|it|helps|me|sleep|.|I|have|fibromyalgia|.|I|was|taking|Lycria|for|damaged|nerves|in|my|hand|and|an|anti|depressant|but|since|I|have|stopped|taking|the|anti|depressant|,|my|mood|is|really|bad|,|angry|all|the|time|.|I|just|wonder|if|it|is|worthwhile|taking|the|new|one|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695087154427367612/Incomplete-transverse-myelitis---Neurology---MedHelp	Incomplete transverse myelitis - Neurology - MedHelp	"Hi - I am currently undergoing a lot of examinations as I have 2 lesions on the spinal cord (incomplete transverse myelitis). One placed cervical and one further down. No lesions on the brain. I am very concerned about the lack of progress the doctors are making finding out what is causing this. So far I have seen a neurologist and currently I am being examined for infections. It was back in September I had my MRI and lumbal puncture. As mentioned above the MRI revealed two lesions on the spine. Tests of the csf revealed oligoclonal bands. WBC in CSF was 43. Borrelia was negative in CSF and Blood. Negative tests for HSV-1 and HSV-2 in CSF. Doctors concluded that there was no infection in CSF. Thus suspecting auto-immune, demylenating disease (MS). I am told I have CIS. Blood tests revealed elevated WBC in blood. Neutrophillocytes (8.01), Monocytes (0.84), Leukocytes (11,3). Lymphocytes are normal. They have NOT made test for oligoclonal bands in the blood. Would you think this could be a postinfectious/infectious incident of Partial Transverse Myelitis? Further info: Paraneoplastic markers are all negative. My general health is good and I only have minor symptoms that have become less and less since june.. (tingling, burning sensations on/off, primarily right side, but lately a bit more symmetrical. Symptoms change position and severity - but in general very mild). I am ""positive"" it is caused by an infection as I have been struggling a lot with urinary tract infections in recent years - suspecting mycoplasma. But when being examined by a MS expert it seems they want you to fit the MS diagnose and not investigate things much further.

My left eye wouldn't go all the way left so I was seeing double. Doctors said is was West Nile. Then 3 years later my whole left side head to toe went numb. I did another MRI and then Spinal Tap. Then I had a Spinal headache for 3 days. Then got the call saying I have MS. Both my mom and grandma started to cry. My mom said you are taking this better then I thought. I told I'm relieved. I'm not CRAZY. My grandma said ""not only did you get my name but you got my disease"" I told her ""its not like I'm dying in 6 weeks. Its just something I have to live with for the rest of my life. You can help me through it. To be honest I haven't had major moments I started Avonex right away and went in to remission in 2009 when I was pregnant and have been till now. I have a few symptoms but not bad ones. They last any from an hour to a few days. I'm hoping they stay that way. My biggest challenge is taking care of my two boys on my bad days. Lately I have be dizziness and pain. I would say to someone new to MS It doesn't define who you are, and don't let it control your life. You can control it.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692591180743991592/Post-operative-risks-and-MS---Multiple-Sclerosis---MS-----MedHelp	Post operative risks and MS - Multiple Sclerosis - MS - - MedHelp	Dear Dr. Kantor,. My dilemma is not about whether I have MS or not but advice on another procedure I am due to have carried out. In September last year I had problems with my legs to the point of being unable to walk for a time, which ended in being referred to an orthopedic surgeon. An MRI on my knees in January this year revealed that the right knee has some reduced space, bits of bone / debris and a tear in the meniscus cartilage. This was anticipated as it has given me problems for approximately 12 years. An arthroscopy was recommended and is booked to go ahead on 1st May. However, the surgeon felt that the main problem with my legs that I had been referred for was probably neurological –and adviced me to talk to my neurologist. I had a further meeting with my neurologist last week to discuss the symptoms I had experienced in my legs. I was diagnosed with mild MS in December last year and during the diagnosis phase we had not considered my knees / legs as I had been told by my GP it was a physical injury, caused by overuse. The neuro has now ordered an MRI of the spine, a full neurological exam (it did not include my legs last time) and an LP if the first 2 tests are not conclusive. He also said 'Are you sure you have enough pain in the right knee for surgery?', as he is now sure that my leg problems were typical for MS. During my leg problems the left knee was much worse but no problems were detected on the MRI. My questions are:. Should I go ahead with an arthroscopy or delay it until my MS diagnosis process is complete? As the operation is predominately diagnostic, although he does think my knee will be more 'comfortable' afterwards, would it be an unnecessary risk having a full anesthetic for a diagnostic operation, are there extra risks with MS in this? Thank you and sorry to be so long winded but the story is a real mix up of symptoms being mistaken by both me and my GP. 	1	1	Post|operative|risks|and|MS|-|Multiple|Sclerosis|-|MS|-|-|MedHelp	Dear|Dr|.|Kantor|,|.|My|dilemma|is|not|about|whether|I|have|MS|or|not|but|advice|on|another|procedure|I|am|due|to|have|carried|out|.|In|September|last|year|I|had|problems|with|my|legs|to|the|point|of|being|unable|to|walk|for|a|time|,|which|ended|in|being|referred|to|an|orthopedic|surgeon|.|An|MRI|on|my|knees|in|January|this|year|revealed|that|the|right|knee|has|some|reduced|space|,|bits|of|bone|/|debris|and|a|tear|in|the|meniscus|cartilage|.|This|was|anticipated|as|it|has|given|me|problems|for|approximately|12|years|.|An|arthroscopy|was|recommended|and|is|booked|to|go|ahead|on|1st|May|.|However|,|the|surgeon|felt|that|the|main|problem|with|my|legs|that|I|had|been|referred|for|was|probably|neurological|–|and|adviced|me|to|talk|to|my|neurologist|.|I|had|a|further|meeting|with|my|neurologist|last|week|to|discuss|the|symptoms|I|had|experienced|in|my|legs|.|I|was|diagnosed|with|mild|MS|in|December|last|year|and|during|the|diagnosis|phase|we|had|not|considered|my|knees|/|legs|as|I|had|been|told|by|my|GP|it|was|a|physical|injury|,|caused|by|overuse|.|The|neuro|has|now|ordered|an|MRI|of|the|spine|,|a|full|neurological|exam|(|it|did|not|include|my|legs|last|time|)|and|an|LP|if|the|first|2|tests|are|not|conclusive|.|He|also|said|'|Are|you|sure|you|have|enough|pain|in|the|right|knee|for|surgery|?|'|,|as|he|is|now|sure|that|my|leg|problems|were|typical|for|MS|.|During|my|leg|problems|the|left|knee|was|much|worse|but|no|problems|were|detected|on|the|MRI|.|My|questions|are|:|.|Should|I|go|ahead|with|an|arthroscopy|or|delay|it|until|my|MS|diagnosis|process|is|complete|?|As|the|operation|is|predominately|diagnostic|,|although|he|does|think|my|knee|will|be|more|'|comfortable|'|afterwards|,|would|it|be|an|unnecessary|risk|having|a|full|anesthetic|for|a|diagnostic|operation|,|are|there|extra|risks|with|MS|in|this|?|Thank|you|and|sorry|to|be|so|long|winded|but|the|story|is|a|real|mix|up|of|symptoms|being|mistaken|by|both|me|and|my|GP|.

More details in question details. Causes? - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp	"Right foot turns outward. More details in question details. - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp. Hi and welcome to the MS community although what your dealing with is not specifically an MS issue, people with MS can and do still experience Plantar Fasciitis and Heel Spurs just like anybody. It's possible with plantar fasciitis and heel spurs to additionally experience compensatory ankle issues basically because the ankle joint has to do a lot more work to keep the ankle stable and it can cause pain or discomfort that runs down either side of the ankle bone. One of the more common causes of plantar fasciitis and heel spurs, as well as ankle issues, is not actually a problem with the feet or ankle but from overly tight calf muscles, which is why calf stretching is typically part of the treatment plan. ""Exercise. Plantar fasciitis is aggravated by tight muscles in your feet and calves. Stretching your calves and plantar fascia is the most effective way to relieve the pain that comes with this condition. Lean forward against a wall with one knee straight and the heel on the ground. Place the other leg in front, with the knee bent. To stretch the calf muscles and the heel cord, push your hips toward the wall in a controlled fashion. Hold the position for 10 seconds and relax. Repeat this exercise 20 times for each foot. A strong pull in the calf should be felt during the stretch. Plantar fascia stretch. This stretch is performed in the seated position. Cross your affected foot over the knee of your other leg. Grasp the toes of your painful foot and slowly pull them toward you in a controlled fashion. If it is difficult to reach your foot, wrap a towel around your big toe to help pull your toes toward you. Place your other hand along the plantar fascia. The fascia should feel like a tight band along the bottom of your foot when stretched. Hold the stretch for 10 seconds. Repeat it 20 times for each foot. This exercise is best done in the morning before standing or walking."" I'd recommend you consult your dr and consider seeing a physio. Hope that helps......

I rolled in there with my wheelchair expecting to hear I had ALS or some kind of awful illness. My neuro examined me as usual and then sat me down. He ever so gently told me that although he thinks I MS, he is pretty sure that my swift progression is psychosomatic. My reaction was tears. I cried because I knew deep down that he was probably right. He wasn't saying that there is nothing going on, but he was saying that all most of my mobility issues were due to fear and anxiety. As some of you may recall, this is not the first time I had heard this. He said if it is not MS, he is still concerned with all the ""spots"" on my brain MRI. He said I could be one of those people with a rare neurological disorder that they don't normally see. I think he was just trying to make me feel like I wasn't a nut job! He's very caring. He is having me get a second opinion from the MS neuro in the practice. Upon leaving his office I proceeded to feel really sorry for myself. After that, I decided to get out of that damn wheelchair and start walking. None to my surprise I can walk. Now I am not walking like a ""normal"" person, but I can get around to living. A few days later I saw my psychiatrist, who had already spoken to my neuro, and he said I did not have conversion disorder, but I did have much anxiety. We left off agreeing that I should take daily ""walks."" Next week I will see a psychologist and finally start dealing with this anxiety. It is something I can no longer ignore. Today I saw a chiropractor who lives on my street wouldn't you know. He said that he could see why my legs were initially having difficulty. My spine is all jammed up. I am also going to get acupuncture to help deal with the anxiety issues. I see him again on Monday. Next week I see the other neuro and if he says he doesn't think I have MS, I am going to stop looking. I am not hoping I have MS as this year has been hell for my family. I do know for sure that if it is indeed MS, it is not going to kill me anytime soon and I am very capable of functioning normally most days. I want to thank all of you on the forum who have followed me this last year. It has been very enlightening. But the thing I like the most about this forum is that no one will be dis honest. There have been many times that I have been ""called out"" on my posts and it has made me be honest with myself and really discover the root of my issues. So far I have figured out I have had one AWFUL childhood. I don't think I ever had the guts to admit but there it is. Maybe I should make a stop at the mental health forum. Can't hurt!

I'm afraid I'm being really cheeky here again after disappearing from your lives for a while, I come back and ask questions of the 'real' experts when my neuro is being a twit as he so often is. By the way, twit is an English expression that replaces the expletives that should be applied to him! So my question is: has anyone around here suffered from Scintillating Scotomas SS (Visual aura with no migraine)? The reason I ask is I started getting these about a year ago. When they happen I get a clutch of them altogether in a few days, sometimes several a day, and then they stop again for a month or so. They are often accompanied by other MSy type symptoms, but I can't establish which is instigating which. As SS is a concern when it's starts at 60+ I was whisked off to the TIA clinic initially:. Consultant there said it's not vascular it's neurological go see your MS neuro. My neuro says it's not neurological it's vascular and it's migraine. Don't worry have a look at the Migraine Trust website. The website says if this occurs for the first time in over 60s the diagnosis should be guarded and looked at carefully as it's associated with stroke. I ask again of MS team and they order Carotid Doppler, EEG, blood tests, etc. nothing shows up all fine! So here's my conundrum:. I was diagnosed with tendency to epilepsy before I was diagnosed with MS. We know MS can cause epilepsy, my neuro says there is no relationship between epilepsy and MS! But SS is also associated with epilepsy. Then I was diagnosed with MS. Now I've been diagnosed with Migraine too, Migraine is associated with epilepsy and with MS but my neuro says no! Can one person really have 3 neurological problems and none of them be connected? Particularly as I know I have lesions in the visual cortex and my vision has always been an issue, hence my user name.

I have had many epidurals for my lumbar pain via fluoroscopic instrument. I never have had a problem. I have the epidural injection to block nerve pain.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692591195914123388/Pregnant-while-injecting-Rebif---Multiple-Sclerosis---MedHelp	Pregnant while injecting Rebif - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp	Hi, Welcome to our little bright side of the moon. Yes, if you are pregnant STOP the Rebif. The problem with the interferons and pregnancy is that they have a powerful ability to cause miscarriage. All of the interferons do. Now that you are already pregnant all you can do is stop the med. In my reading the tendency to cause miscarriage is the main concern. I read repeatedly that in the pregnancies that went on to deliver, that there was no problem with malformations or any other type of birth defect. The babies are healthy. So, I would think there is no reason to even consider terminating the pregnancy on this basis. But, I am NOT an expert in this field!! Now, this is a hugely important topic. I want you to get ahold of an OB and get this question to them ASAP. While you are waiting for official answers I believe that you should stop the Rebif immediately. And I hope this is a welcome pregnancy. Pregnancy does not complicate MS at all. In fact the majority of women feel much better and have far fewer relapses while pregnant. there is even some data that suggest that pregnancy can exert a favorable influence on the lifetime disease. The main concern is the high likelihood of a relaspe in the 3 months following delivery, so this should be kept in mind when deciding on returning to work or in having extra help available.

CSF test results are: elevated CSF IgG index(1.49)CSF IgG synthesis rate(39.8)total proteins (54) and 2 oligoclonal bands in the far gamma region,Albumin Index is normal and all other test are with in normal limits. I have had this for 7 years and I can't find a doctor to help me with my pain and treatment. They thought it was MS for a while but MRI's and EMG's always come back normal(except slight inferior ectopia of cerebellar tonsils of 4mm,and small increased signal in the right mastoid region). I suffer from daily headaches,buzzing feeling mostly in feet(worse when anxious and more noticable when at rest),little squiggly flashes of light on vision most noticable when I look at a light colored wall or the sky, constant neck pain, small amount of pain and aching in muscles and joints. I have been through about 10-12 specialists in 7 years and I still don't have any answers, the have tested me for several illnesses like:Lyme,MS,Neurosyphillis,several additional Lab tests, and all Labs seem to be normal except CSF. Well I recently went to the Mayo clinic and they tested the csf and now I have 13 O-bands and slightly elevated iGg index and protiens, they told me that I probably got viral encephalitis 7 years ago and I'm still suffering the effects of it today, I thought O-bands were suppossed to go away when the disease is gone.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692591198702110490/Help-reading-the-MRI-report---Multiple-Sclerosis---MedHelp	Help reading the MRI report - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp	"Hi and welcome,. In the findings section of your report it provides you with specific lesion information...""These are old rounded and measure approximately 1 mm. These are nonspecific and could represent incidental gliosis. Migraine related white matter change could also cause these findings. These are not typical for demyelination."" A few 'tiny' (less than 3mm in size) round shaped white matter lesions only located in the subcortical area are very common findings and because of the shape, size and singular common location it would generally indicate these findings are highly unlikely to be demyelinating lesions, which are the specific type of lesions suggestive-consistent with MS. Your MRI report also states within the conclusions section that your MRI only showed ""Occasional subcortical white matter hyperintensities in the centrum semiovale ovale probably incidental gliosis. IF MS was one of the potential causation's you were being assessed for, what ever symptoms, neurologically abnormal clinical signs you have etc, it looks like your brain MRI evidence alone would be placing a condition like MS very low down on your potential causes list, so it's very possible what you've experienced is not related to a neurological condition like MS and one of it's mimics. I hope that helps..... sorry typo, it should read....so it's very possible what you've experienced is not related to a neurological condition like MS and it is one of MS's many mimics instead. Thanks for providing more details to this. I wanted to mention I have few symptoms such as tremors, pins and needles, spasms. Please advisde why the radiologist said these are not typical for demyelination. ""In the findings section of your report it provides you with specific lesion information...""These are old rounded and measure approximately 1 mm. IF you are asking ""why the radiologist said these are not typical for demyelination"" when you didn't actually have a brain MRI to even look for MS, and the radiologist just mentioning 'demyelination' is confusing or worrying you... Radiologists generally examine patients MRI scans and report any normal and abnormal findings they see, Radiologists typically use structured reporting or contextual reporting templates, which are basically standardised text blocks for the different types of things commonly found on an MRI that he/she can pick and choose to put into an individuals report. ""These are nonspecific and could represent incidental gliosis. These are not typical for demyelination."" is likely to be the standardised text block the radiologist uses for non specific white matter hypersensitivities (WMH). Non specific means that the WMH’s are not specific to any disorder but in order to establish clinical significance, the findings need to be correlated with a your clinical history and neurological examination. Symptoms are not the same as 'clinical' objective signs of neurological abnormality eg Clonus, Babinski sign, hyperreflexia etc. Unfortunately the types of symptoms you've mentioned could literally be caused by many different things, having the occasional tiny 1 mm sized lesion in only the subcortical area would usually be an unlikely explanation for any abnormal clinical signs, so what ever is causing you these issues is probably not being caused by a brain related abnormality.

I have been having symptoms of MS. I got these off the internet: slow word recall, abnormal pupil responses, infrequent bowel movements, short term memory loss, vision problems, problems empying my bladder, unbalanced and incontinence (at night when i get out of bed to go to the bathroom) I am on Humira. It lowers your immune system and can cause MS. The first thing I noticed was my vision seemed to have changed over night. I have wore glasses for far away objects for years but now I have trouble seeing things close up. It was so sudden. I went to an ophthamologist and he said it was from my diabetes. He said my vision would fluctuate with my sugar and i told him it was hard to to see things close up all the time. He just dismissed it. The highest my sugar has been other than the glucose tolerance test is 188. If there is such a thing as low grade diabetes then thats what i have. Before that a woman checked my pupils and she said my left pupil got bigger when she shined the light in my eyes and the right one constricted really slow. The doctor didn't even mention that. I was told to come back in 1-2 weeks so his partner could test me and fit me for contacts. The doctor also said that my old prescription was too strong for my eyes. But they have always helped me to see far off. I am only 28 and i have to hold things a way from my face to read it. I have also had to get my husband to read things for me because it was to small. I have an appointment to see a neuro-ophthamologist. I am scared to know the results. I am going to him for a second opinion. Can anyone tell me what he will do.

One of the problems is that IBS is too readily dx, if you have a history of constipation or diarrhea you'll end up with a dx of IBS. By Karen S. Kaufman, MS, CCN. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal ailment that affects up to 20 percent of the population.1 IBS symptoms include cramps, abdominal pain, gas, bloating, and alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea. These symptoms range from being mildly annoying to very painful and disabling. According to one study, about 35 million people currently suffer from IBS. Women are afflicted about twice as often as men. Given the large number of people suffering from IBS, it is not surprising that a similarly high percentage of pharmaceutical advertising is devoted to popularizing over the counter medications for symptoms such as intestinal gas, bloating, diarrhea or constipation. IBS is caused by dysfunctions in bowel motility--from whatever cause. Both hyper- (excessive) or hypo- (inadequate) bowel motility may lead, respectively, to constipation or diarrhea. People with IBS are either very sensitive to or have excessive amounts of gut hormones such as Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP), Cholecystokinin (CCK), and motilin. These substances can cause motility disturbances throughout the upper GI tract and colon.2. Constipation is the more common issue for MSers but diarrhea isn't though bouts of constipation can cause leakages getting past the obstruction but its not really classed as diarrhea. Is that too much information? Sometimes the meds cause bowel issues so thats worth checking out if you havent already. I'm sure there lots on the topic in our archives if you want to go looking, sorry i'm exhausted or i'd find something for you. 	1	0	MS|and|IBS|-|Multiple|Sclerosis|-|MedHelp	From|memory|yes|though|its|constipation|thats|more|closely|connected|to|MS|than|actual|true|IBS|.|One|of|the|problems|is|that|IBS|is|too|readily|dx|,|if|you|have|a|history|of|constipation|or|diarrhea|you'll|end|up|with|a|dx|of|IBS|.|By|Karen|S|.|Kaufman|,|MS|,|CCN|.|Irritable|Bowel|Syndrome|(|IBS|)|is|a|common|gastrointestinal|ailment|that|affects|up|to|20|percent|of|the|population|.|1|IBS|symptoms|include|cramps|,|abdominal|pain|,|gas|,|bloating|,|and|alternating|bouts|of|constipation|and|diarrhea|.|These|symptoms|range|from|being|mildly|annoying|to|very|painful|and|disabling|.|According|to|one|study|,|about|35|million|people|currently|suffer|from|IBS|.|Women|are|afflicted|about|twice|as|often|as|men|.|Given|the|large|number|of|people|suffering|from|IBS|,|it|is|not|surprising|that|a|similarly|high|percentage|of|pharmaceutical|advertising|is|devoted|to|popularizing|over|the|counter|medications|for|symptoms|such|as|intestinal|gas|,|bloating|,|diarrhea|or|constipation|.|IBS|is|caused|by|dysfunctions|in|bowel|motility--from|whatever|cause|.|Both|hyper|-|(|excessive|)|or|hypo|-|(|inadequate|)|bowel|motility|may|lead|,|respectively|,|to|constipation|or|diarrhea|.|People|with|IBS|are|either|very|sensitive|to|or|have|excessive|amounts|of|gut|hormones|such|as|Vasoactive|Intestinal|Peptide|(|VIP|)|,|Cholecystokinin|(|CCK|)|,|and|motilin|.|These|substances|can|cause|motility|disturbances|throughout|the|upper|GI|tract|and|colon|.|2|.|Constipation|is|the|more|common|issue|for|MSers|but|diarrhea|isn't|though|bouts|of|constipation|can|cause|leakages|getting|past|the|obstruction|but|its|not|really|classed|as|diarrhea|.|Is|that|too|much|information|?|Sometimes|the|meds|cause|bowel|issues|so|thats|worth|checking|out|if|you|havent|already|.|I'm|sure|there|lots|on|the|topic|in|our|archives|if|you|want|to|go|looking|,|sorry|i'm|exhausted|or|i'd|find|something|for|you|.

Over a period of the next 45-60 seconds, this pain and weekness ""creeps"" up my inner arms, at exactly the same pace for each.

As soon as it reaches my chest and back, I feel very lightheaded. I feel as though I should be white as a sheet, but those who have been around me when this happens have all said I look quite normal. During these episodes, it is painful to raise my arms or to use them in any way, so thankfully these episodes haven't occurred while driving! If forced to, I could certainly move them, but I choose not to if I don't have to!!! When these episodes first began, I recovered rather rapidly. Lately, however, I am left with a feeling of extreme fatigue/exhaustion. Also, now when I have an episode, I'm usually left with muscle weakness for about 24 hours. I also feel like I've lost strength in my arms and hands over time. Does anyone know what this might be a sign of???

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692591595544593408/Possible-ms-symptoms---Multiple-Sclerosis---MedHelp	Possible ms symptoms - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp	Hi and welcome,. The main reason google will always bring up neurological conditions like MS in symptom searches is because MS is associated with balance issues, numbness, tingling as well as hundreds of other symptoms simply because MS is a condition that affects the central nervous system BUT what googling symptoms won't give you is a way to match your specific list of symptoms, pattern and time frame with any specific medical condition. Your extensive symptom list, symptom pattern and short time frame are all generally pointing away from neurological conditions like MS being a likely causation....basically the way lesion damage works, present and develop over time, neurological conditions wouldn't even get on the list of possible causes because you have too much happening that honestly doesn't fit, is happening too fast, is all over, in all peripheral limbs etc and would combined generally be more likely consistent- suggestive of something else.... It's possible the dr's were talking about secondary drug adverse effects making things worse and your focusing on these symptoms all began 3 weeks ago so drug side effects doesn't make sense as the cause.......from my lay person understanding it would be suggestive of it beginning with an infection or virus eg 1. Low grade reoccurring fever x 3 weeks, 9. Watery eye reoccurring left dominant x 3 weeks,. Weakness general arms legs head x 3 weeks, 13. Dizziness reoccurring/feeling faint x 3 weeks with further symptoms being added in the following weeks as it progressed unabated. It is actually possible for your daily medication of seroquel to of helped prolong the reaction, basically created a combined drug adverse reaction because seroquel has hundreds of medication known to cause combined interaction issues, the adverse side effects of these drugs would be hard to ignore with the timing... You've mentioned being treated for bronchitis which is very common and it is caused by virus infections in over 95% of case with the minority caused by bacteria so you are most likely dealing with a fairly common viral infection and unfortunately experienced a rare adverse reaction to the Tesselon perle to suppress the cough, which can cause convulsions.

Am I typical? - Multiple Sclerosis - MS - - MedHelp	Is this progression of MS? Am I typical? - Multiple Sclerosis - MS - - MedHelp. I was diagnosed with RRMS last February after two bouts of ON, abnormal MRI, leg that seemed like it was not there, extreme fatigue, bathroom issues, and tests that were normal. I have had a lot of sensory symptoms that include numbness but have never had a limb go completely numb. I have been on Avonex almost a year. I sleep a lot but I had to stop taking Provigil because it was shooting my bp up too high. ;( So I just sleep when I need to now. I feel more rested and feel better. My PT wants me to ask if Provigil can cause weakness and balance problems? Over the past year the new symptoms I have are progression of weakness, balance issues, and tremors. I am going to weekly PT and OT. Both have recommended I get a rollator for in the home and a scooter for outside of my home. It is confusing when one week I need my walker and the next I am fairly steady. My MS doctor is not completly happy with how I am doing. I know my question is difficult to answer but is it possible for my strength and balance to get back to normal? My balance is bad enough my PT says I should not be walking unassisted. That is why I have the rollator. My hand strength is pathetic. I can not do resistance exersices so they have me doing isometric. I am wondering how I got here. I used to be very physically strong for a girl. I could pass a foot ball as far as any guy! But now I am so weak I can not easily lift a one pound weight. How does this happen without me noticing? I knew things were going on but didn't realize how bad it was until I got into therapy. I have been over compensating in other areas long enough now I guess I just didn't realize what was happening. I have a great MS specialist taking care of me.

As a woman with MS I have had the concerns too about having a pregnancy after diagnosis of MS. Pregnancy actually puts MS into remission while you are pregnant, but the risk of relapse after pregnancy is higher than if you had never been pregnant. I would say that comes out to about neutral, wouldn't you? Female hormones have a suppressing effect on MS and other ""autoimmune"" disorders. There was a study done on estriol, a hormone that the body makes while pregnant, and the women who were taking it had their MS go into remission. Since then some have discredited the study, and the FDA has tried to outlaw estriol. The only way to get it right now is for menopausal or perimenopausal symptoms. Some women get perimenopause in their 30's. And then it has to be made up by a compounding pharmacy, which there are some around, not too big a deal. The cost is very low. Anyhoo - from what I could find the risk of MS in your child could be as high as one in 35 or so. But if you breastfeed very well (for up to 3 years) it will lay down a very thick coat of myelin in your child's brain as well as help their immune system. Not being breastfed and especially being put on cow milk formula in infancy is a major trigger for those of us who have the MS gene (of course, we don't find out until later in life). My naturopath tells me that a pregnancy would be great for my body in suppressing the MS but I am not willing to do that until more ducks are in a row. LOL ; ). I am not sure if breastfeeding protects you from progressing in the MS but I think it may since you have all those extra female hormones. That is what I am banking on for future childbearing. I am on Avonex and you shouldn't get pregnant while on Avonex as they don't know yet if it is a tetragen (cause birth defects). I would suspect that you would not want to be on a shot while breastfeeding either. You would have to look into it further. As far as the cost of the meds, until the national healthcare stuff goes through, you have to find a better employer for yourself or spouse if the cost of the meds is too much. You can ask the National MS Society for financial help. The state is no help unless you want to ""pay down"" the difference between your income and the medicaid income eligibility level (below poverty line). Biogen Idec has a program for people who can't afford their meds that really helped a friend of mine. You could give them a call. I think they are the makers of a couple of the drug therapies but I don't know if they make the one you are considering. I chose avonex because it had the least number of injections LOL ; ) and luckily it is working well for me (Biogen Idec is the maker of Avonex). Women are the ones who get autoimmune conditions the most and I think it maybe because we are not living our natural ""cave woman"" life of constant babies and nursing. MS is a first world disease and I think that has a lot to do with it. The women in previous generations who had the MS gene, it was masked by all the female hormones in their system due to pregnancy and nursing and of course they were probably nursed themselves. So the changes in childbearing and rearing practices could be part of why we are seeing more MS and other autoimmune conditions as time goes on. Of course we also have more plastics, etc. too (never microwave in tupperware or plastic wrap! in fact, don't microwave at all. Other countries have outlawed them.).

Last opthamologist appointment I was told I had occular rosacea? and by chance had missed one of the color charts red plate. 4 months prior I had no issues. Since the birth of my son (surprise baby) I have been on a downward spiral. Pain, balance, muscle spasms, walking issues, tremors, sleep issues and fatigue. I take medication to help but not much seems to help provigil is not too helpful anymore. I have severe neck pain and back pain. I take hydrocodone Ibuprofen, clonipin (sp?) Lyrica, medication for arthritis, antibiotics, sleeping meds... you name it. I think the side effects are awful but not taking them would be worse. Lots of the meds have caused weight gain and although a small issue it bothers me. I suffer incontinence in bouts also have bowel issues. I have numbness and tingling and am very weak. I try to exercise but it leaves me suffering for days after. If the tests being peformed now are negative my neuro wants to send me to UVA to specialist. After all the docs I was reserved to go to yet another dr but at this point I know I have to and will run there if I have to. For the first time in my life I have ADD.

BUT--I sort of slipped into not taking one because I had already had MS about 15-20 years before they became available. And thoise years were manageable with sensory symptoms alone for the most part. I do think if at all possible everyone with MS (along with their doctor) choose one that is palatable and ""get right to it"" after perhaos waiting and seeing what the first 6mos to a year brings, oif inital symptoms are very slight. It only makes sense to me to protect ourselves for the future. That said, I am one who especially hates the ""Benign"" diagnosis----there is very very little about MS which is benign! Add it all up and I doubt if it EVER is Benign. MS is a hideous disease which has the potential to affect evevy single aspect of our lives. Take away a neuro's judgment, concentration, ability to speak and walk, sex life, energy levels, composure and self-esteem and ask them is it's benign for them!!! My former neuro called my 36 year old MS Benign because I could walk (but not far and not well.) She said I didn't have enough going on to make it less than Benign.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702046120260285229/Sudden-onset-of-cracking-joints-all-over---Degenerative-Diseases---MedHelp	Sudden onset of cracking joints all over - Degenerative Diseases - MedHelp	I get all over body cracks once in awhile, to me it is usually accompanied with spasms and aches and pains. I get nerve problems, and symptoms similar to MS and have times where it feels like I'm having some kind of absent seizure or stroke, and nerve pills have helped those symptoms. Could be lack of nutrients, usually spasms and nerve issues are due to lack of electrolytes. My shoulder has always had issues so it often gets very sore whenever this happens. I get pains in my ribs and back. In general I get very fatigued when this happens, but for example today I didn't eat properly, I didn't sleep properly, plus I did heavy weight lifting a couple days ago and if I don't rest and eat properly afterward a big workout like that it does give me major issues like this. On top of that, I get major anal bleeding and terrible stomach pain when I eat starchy carbs for more than a couple days, and unfortunately I ate some popcorn every day for many days because I didn't think it was classified as a starchy carb, but my body disagrees and I also ate a crap load of yams last night, and I'm guessing my body doesn't like those either because I felt terrible afterwards, and today I've been having rectal bleeding very heavily. It doesn't worry me as much as you think it would because I have eliminated starchy carbs from my diet and the bleeding stopped completely many times before. Obviously, there is something wrong with the part of my intestine that digests carbs and doctors are too stupid to do anything about it, I believe it is similar to an ulcer and just needs time to heal but I keep making it worse by eating starchy carbs when I shouldn't. (I honestly didn't think popcorn or yams would hurt me but now I know they are big no no foods for me). My point is with a combination of all of the above, today all my joints started cracking and my entire body feels like crap and that is usually a sign I'm just completely worn out. I think that if all your joints are cracking, it's a huge sign that something is amiss. For me, it's usually a combination of things but rest, eating lots of protein and fixing my posture always helps. I've noticed that my posture is out of whack, probably due to muscle imbalances from heavy weight lifting, this greatly effects my spine and ribs, in general that also effects my digestion, I think it is all connected. When I eat spicy foods lately, the heartburn I get in return actually sets of trigger points in my abdominal muscles which make my ribs and shoulders and upper back hurt. They say that abdominal trigger points can be triggered by internal issues. I actually think I've developed some sort of allergic reaction to harsh spices, it almost closed my throat up too. Obviously, something not right is going on with me, but rest, eating lots of protien and animal products and dairy products, cutting out all starchy carbs and not eating any spicey foods (eating minimal vegetables) and doing yoga and making sure to work out to correct my posture makes me feel a lot better. At first it was just gluten that made me bleed internally, but over time it became all starchy carbs. 	0	0	Sudden|onset|of|cracking|joints|all|over|-|Degenerative|Diseases|-|MedHelp	I|get|all|over|body|cracks|once|in|awhile|,|to|me|it|is|usually|accompanied|with|spasms|and|aches|and|pains|.|I|get|nerve|problems|,|and|symptoms|similar|to|MS|and|have|times|where|it|feels|like|I'm|having|some|kind|of|absent|seizure|or|stroke|,|and|nerve|pills|have|helped|those|symptoms|.|Could|be|lack|of|nutrients|,|usually|spasms|and|nerve|issues|are|due|to|lack|of|electrolytes|.|My|shoulder|has|always|had|issues|so|it|often|gets|very|sore|whenever|this|happens|.|I|get|pains|in|my|ribs|and|back|.|In|general|I|get|very|fatigued|when|this|happens|,|but|for|example|today|I|didn't|eat|properly|,|I|didn't|sleep|properly|,|plus|I|did|heavy|weight|lifting|a|couple|days|ago|and|if|I|don't|rest|and|eat|properly|afterward|a|big|workout|like|that|it|does|give|me|major|issues|like|this|.|On|top|of|that|,|I|get|major|anal|bleeding|and|terrible|stomach|pain|when|I|eat|starchy|carbs|for|more|than|a|couple|days|,|and|unfortunately|I|ate|some|popcorn|every|day|for|many|days|because|I|didn't|think|it|was|classified|as|a|starchy|carb|,|but|my|body|disagrees|and|I|also|ate|a|crap|load|of|yams|last|night|,|and|I'm|guessing|my|body|doesn't|like|those|either|because|I|felt|terrible|afterwards|,|and|today|I've|been|having|rectal|bleeding|very|heavily|.|It|doesn't|worry|me|as|much|as|you|think|it|would|because|I|have|eliminated|starchy|carbs|from|my|diet|and|the|bleeding|stopped|completely|many|times|before|.|Obviously|,|there|is|something|wrong|with|the|part|of|my|intestine|that|digests|carbs|and|doctors|are|too|stupid|to|do|anything|about|it|,|I|believe|it|is|similar|to|an|ulcer|and|just|needs|time|to|heal|but|I|keep|making|it|worse|by|eating|starchy|carbs|when|I|shouldn't|.|(|I|honestly|didn't|think|popcorn|or|yams|would|hurt|me|but|now|I|know|they|are|big|no|no|foods|for|me|)|.|My|point|is|with|a|combination|of|all|of|the|above|,|today|all|my|joints|started|cracking|and|my|entire|body|feels|like|crap|and|that|is|usually|a|sign|I'm|just|completely|worn|out|.|I|think|that|if|all|your|joints|are|cracking|,|it's|a|huge|sign|that|something|is|amiss|.|For|me|,|it's|usually|a|combination|of|things|but|rest|,|eating|lots|of|protein|and|fixing|my|posture|always|helps|.|I've|noticed|that|my|posture|is|out|of|whack|,|probably|due|to|muscle|imbalances|from|heavy|weight|lifting|,|this|greatly|effects|my|spine|and|ribs|,|in|general|that|also|effects|my|digestion|,|I|think|it|is|all|connected|.|When|I|eat|spicy|foods|lately|,|the|heartburn|I|get|in|return|actually|sets|of|trigger|points|in|my|abdominal|muscles|which|make|my|ribs|and|shoulders|and|upper|back|hurt|.|They|say|that|abdominal|trigger|points|can|be|triggered|by|internal|issues|.|I|actually|think|I've|developed|some|sort|of|allergic|reaction|to|harsh|spices|,|it|almost|closed|my|throat|up|too|.|Obviously|,|something|not|right|is|going|on|with|me|,|but|rest|,|eating|lots|of|protien|and|animal|products|and|dairy|products|,|cutting|out|all|starchy|carbs|and|not|eating|any|spicey|foods|(|eating|minimal|vegetables|)|and|doing|yoga|and|making|sure|to|work|out|to|correct|my|posture|makes|me|feel|a|lot|better|.|At|first|it|was|just|gluten|that|made|me|bleed|internally|,|but|over|time|it|became|all|starchy|carbs|.

I know also that my symptoms definately are partially related to anxiety as they are worse when i am thinking about them. The MRI came back saying mostly normal sounding stuff, other than:.

No lesion is seen in the corpus callosum or brain stem. Non specific but suspicious of an inflammatory de-myelinating process"" I know that that means possible MS.

COMMUNITY LEADER. supermum_ms. Hi and welcome,. I'm not sure why a neurological condition like MS would get on your potential causes list when your saying you don't have any suggestive-consistent MS lesion evidence and this originated whilst you were recovering as an inpatient after undergoing neck surgery, and 3 months on and your still not even close to normal functioning yet. Honestly the more likely cause of this to me would be that it's in some way associated with the cervical spinal surgery, that type of surgery would be the logical catalyst... It's good idea to see a neurologist, hopefully you'll get an independent second opinion on what's happened, and with the surgery being 3 months ago you'll likely need additional brain and spinal MRI's, nerve conductor tests, cognitive assessment etc etc before you have a better idea of what is going on. Hope that helps a little....... JJ. 1 Comments. Ambu10. Thanks for your comments. I know that seems like the most logical cause. Believe me, I was very angry with him. He has sit me down in front of a computer and shown me my spine after surgery and there is no stenosis left. He said the hardware in my neck looks well aligned. The nerves were all functioning correctly during surgery as they were continuously monitored (I guess they do that somehow?). I had a nerve conduction study and it was normal. I'm still not totally convinced yet either. But My primary care dr at one point thought I might have had MS in the past too. I had some temporary vision loss in my right eye a year ago. I also had a couple episodes of some vertigo/ataxia. One time I ended up walking into a wall and sliding down because the vertigo was so bad. The vertigo never lasted very long though. Again MRI was negative. They ended up calling it occipital neuralgia. Basically a pinched nerve in the back of my head. The problem is I can't have a mri of my spine, I have a medical device. It's an Interstim for interstitial cystitis. (Nerve stimulator in the low back to help my bladder) it has been there for many years). I'm at at loss. Very confused. . . Comment. Dizziness and vertigo can be caused by neck (cervical spine) dysfunction, which is known as cerviocogenic dizziness or Cervical vertigo, occipital neuralgia is a variant of cervical vertigo. I'm aware that occipital neuralgia is also associated with some type of vision impairments, ocular pain, and nausea so it's likely what you experienced prior to the cervical surgery is interconnected to your neck situation but i can't provide you anything more specific, sorry! I think what you are saying is that even though this originated whilst you were recovering as an inpatient after undergoing neck surgery, your surgeon hasn't been able to find anything physically, neurologically or diagnostically abnormal to account for what you have experienced so he can't work out what the problem is... A full spinal MRI would of been ideal to work out the health of your spine but to give you a better idea about diagnosing MS..... MS spinal cord lesions will typically still show the resulting neurological abnormality during neurological clinical exams even without a spinal MRI to corroborate the cord lesions exist and additionally, you've had at least a couple of brain MRI's over the last year or so and it's not been abnormal. MS literally means 'many scars' so when there isn't any brain 'and or' spinal cord lesions, the likelihood of MS becomes very unlikely compared to the other medical conditions that could also account for the same or similar symptoms the patient is-has experienced......in your situation your existing spinal situation would automatically be a more likely explanation than a neurological condition like MS, because you don't have any MS suggestive-consistent lesion evidence on your brain MRI and you have a diagnostic history that 'could' account for the symptoms you've experienced prior to and after the cervical surgery. I'm out of time, it's Christmas eve over here in OZ and i've still got a million things to do but i do hope i have helped a little bit....... 2 Comments. I will await the neurologist appointment to see what they say. I don't wish to have either problem. I also don't wish to have a physician tell me it's all in my head. So if the surgeon says it's not my spine and the neurologist finds nothing, then I guess it's all in my head. Which most people would think would be good news, but to me that would mean that I'm crazy. I don't want to feel that way right now. ive gone through too much in my life. I'm sorry, I'm extremely depressed right now, I appreciate ur point of view and the time u took in ur response at this busy time of year. I hope u have a merry Christmas! You'd probably be surprised how many people get told by a dr it's psychological and it turns out to be something completely different, it happens a lot in all areas of medicine. My daughter was obviously ill and getting worse, for months she really struggled with fatigue, dizziness, weakness, blurred vision, imbalance and breathing difficulties. She was at her dr's at least twice a week in the end desperate for help but because the tests the dr ran were all normal, her dr started telling her it was anxiety and depression. Since she does deal with anxiety she did start to wonder if it could really be all in her head, but after a really bad day at work she went back to her dr's clinic and begged to see someone else. New set of eyes and the other dr at the same clinic ran completely different tests, checked her breathing and she was trying to function on 30% lung capacity, it turned out she had an easily treated very common contagious childhood disease, she was an adult.....my point is that sometimes it is mental health related and sometimes it just isn't and it can take some time and lots of different types of tests to work out what is truly going on, so hang in there and breath!! I am a firm believer in being proactive about mental health, if your dealing with depression please seek help for your mental health, it is only to your benefit to seek out extra support and guidance, so please seriously consider seeing a psychologist or therapist to help you through this difficult time!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692591175655045993/Reflex-question---Multiple-Sclerosis---MedHelp	Reflex question - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp	Achilles tendon is the bottom half of the gastrocnemius muscle (tendons are merely the ends of the muscle that narrow and connect it to the bone). The gastrocneumius is a knee bender and a plantar flexor (makes foot point down like a ballerina) so when the reflex is checked behind the ankle, if it is intact, it will result in plantar flexion of the foot. A hyperactive reflex (too brisk) is indicative of an upper motor neuron lesion -- something wrong in the brain or upper levels of the spinal cord. A hypoactive reflex (minimal response) is indicative of lower motor neuron lesion -- something wrong in the lower half of the spinal cord or a nerve pinching somewhere else (i.e., like sciatica from the pelvis being out of alignment or one of the deep muscles in the pelvis being VERY unhappy and in spasm. If things are asymmetrical (different from one side to the other), it is often considered more important than if they are symmetrically absent or symmetrically brisk . . . . depends on all the other stuff and the neuro.

The Barometric airpressure affects me for sure. I've had Multiple Sclerosis for 17 years. I had relapse after relapse one year. By the time they stopped, I couldn't move or feel anything. When I starting getting stronger and was getting some feeling back and then the pain kicked in. I Was asked what time of the day did my pain occur. I Couldn't answer that because it was all over the place. I don't know why, but I thought maybe the weather played a part in it. I tracked the weather for a year documenting the dew point, temperatures, air pressure,and wind along with my symptoms. I found a pattern between high and low pressure as well as temperature. When the air pressure is low I am stiff, spastic,cramped up, and have insurmountable fatigue. I Always cry when the air pressure drops and I'm not sad. When the air pressure is high, I feel weak, ache all over, I am sensitive to touch, loud sounds, and other peoples energy. When the pressure changes quickly, my ears pop. When the temperature is cold, I am stiff and spastic. When the temperature is warm, I am weak, I feel nauseous, dizzy, numb, and muscle cramps. I live in Minnesota where changes in weather can be extreme often. I have a small window that feels just right. 29.95-30.15 inches for air pressure and 70-75 degrees with a dew point in the mid-fouties.. I feel almost normal under those conditions. 	1	1	MS|and|Barometric|Pressure|-|Multiple|Sclerosis|-|MedHelp	Oh|,|yes|.|The|Barometric|airpressure|affects|me|for|sure|.|I've|had|Multiple|Sclerosis|for|17|years|.|I|had|relapse|after|relapse|one|year|.|By|the|time|they|stopped|,|I|couldn't|move|or|feel|anything|.|When|I|starting|getting|stronger|and|was|getting|some|feeling|back|and|then|the|pain|kicked|in|.|I|Was|asked|what|time|of|the|day|did|my|pain|occur|.|I|Couldn't|answer|that|because|it|was|all|over|the|place|.|I|don't|know|why|,|but|I|thought|maybe|the|weather|played|a|part|in|it|.|I|tracked|the|weather|for|a|year|documenting|the|dew|point|,|temperatures|,|air|pressure|,|and|wind|along|with|my|symptoms|.|I|found|a|pattern|between|high|and|low|pressure|as|well|as|temperature|.|When|the|air|pressure|is|low|I|am|stiff|,|spastic|,|cramped|up|,|and|have|insurmountable|fatigue|.|I|Always|cry|when|the|air|pressure|drops|and|I'm|not|sad|.|When|the|air|pressure|is|high|,|I|feel|weak|,|ache|all|over|,|I|am|sensitive|to|touch|,|loud|sounds|,|and|other|peoples|energy|.|When|the|pressure|changes|quickly|,|my|ears|pop|.|When|the|temperature|is|cold|,|I|am|stiff|and|spastic|.|When|the|temperature|is|warm|,|I|am|weak|,|I|feel|nauseous|,|dizzy|,|numb|,|and|muscle|cramps|.|I|live|in|Minnesota|where|changes|in|weather|can|be|extreme|often|.|I|have|a|small|window|that|feels|just|right|.|29.95-|30.15|inches|for|air|pressure|and|70-75|degrees|with|a|dew|point|in|the|mid-fouties|..|I|feel|almost|normal|under|those|conditions|.

Your questions, however, surround non medicines, so I will address these:. 1. Massage therapy -- if you call it ""neuromuscular therapy"" it is usually covered by your insurance company. This can help relieve spasticity and make you feel better. 2. Acupuncture -- this can help pain and other symptoms. 3. Reflexology -- It may make you feel better. 4. Exercise -- This is great (even weight bearing exercises), but please make sure that you stay well hydrated and cool. This can help with general wellbeing and health (remember, MS does not prtect you against heart disease etc.), spasticity, weakness, fatigue .... It is always important to weight the costs of these treatments (exercise is the cheapest) against the benefits. My general rule is that if it makes you feel good and is safe, then it is probably worth it. Remember, however that these treatments are not disease modifying but rather are symptomatic treatments.

By Katherine Solem. Feeling dizzy involves a sense of unsteadiness or vertigo. Although causes of dizziness are most often not severe and usually resolve themselves, in some cases dizziness or vertigo can signal a larger problem. Read more about dizziness causes and how to treat dizziness. Causes of Dizziness. Dizziness is a general term that can describe a feeling associated with a number of other symptoms including vertigo, light headedness or just a sense of loss of balance. Each of these can be caused by different things. * Vertigo: Vertigo is feeling a sense of spinning or motion when there is none. + Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV): This is characterized by having a severe, but short, episode of vertigo whenever you shift the position of your head. This is the most common cause of vertigo and can occur when you roll over in your bed or just sit up. + Inner ear inflammation: An inflamed inner ear can cause a sudden onset of vertigo that can last for several days. This usually also involves feeling nauseous, vomiting and feeling imbalanced. While the symptoms can be severe, it usually resolves itself. + Meniere’s disease: This is characterized by inner ear fluid build up. The vertigo associated with this disease occurs suddenly and usually lasts from half an hour to several hours. + Labyrinthitis: This occurs most often immediately following a cold or flu and is due to an infection in your inner ear. + Migrainous vertigo: Some migraines can also cause a feeling of vertigo. + Acoustic neuroma: This is caused by a benign growth on your vestibular nerve which is responsible for connecting your inner ear to your brain. This vertigo is often also accompanied by a gradual loss of hearing and tinnitus. + Neurological problems: While rare, vertigo can also be caused by more serious issues including a stroke, brain hemorrhage or multiple sclerosis. If this is the case, vertigo is often accompanied with vision problems, slurred speech and difficulty walking. * Light headedness: The medical term for this feeling is “presyncope.” This feeling of being lightheaded can involve feeling dizzyand nauseous, having pale or clammy skin. + Blood pressure drop: A sudden drop in your blood pressure can cause this type of dizziness. Particularly as you get older, this can occur from simply getting up too quickly. In more severe cases, a blood pressure drop can be due to severe shock. + Heart problems: Some heart problems that cause your heart to pump too little blood can also cause a feeling of being light headed. This can occur due to a heart attack or stroke. If this is the cause of dizziness, it is usually accompanied by other symptoms including chest pain, increased heart rate, vision changes or speech difficulty. * Loss of balance:. + Vestibular problems: Your inner ear vestibular system is responsible for helping you maintain a sense of balance. As a result, disturbances to your inner ear function can impact your sense of balance. Having difficulty walking in the dark is particularly common with vestibular problems. + Sensory disorders: Loss of vision or nerve damage in your legs can cause balance problems. This is particularly common in older individuals. + Joint and muscle problems: Having muscle problems, including osteoarthritis, can also cause you to lose your balance more easily. + Neurological conditions: Some neurological problems can also cause you to loose your balance. These can include Parkinson’s disease, cerebellar ataxia, spinal cord disorders and normal pressure hydrocephalus. + Medications: Some drugs including anti-seizure medications, tranquilizers and sedatives, can also cause a feeling of imbalance. * Anxiety disorders: Some anxiety disorders can also cause you to feel dizzy or unsteady on your feet.

My diagnosis was proven through a lumbar puncture, visual evoked potential eye exam and other types of testing. I am positive, and my Neurologist concurs, that I've suffered with this disease for over 15 years. My primary care physician told me all those years that I had Fibromyalgia (she still says I likely have it along with the MS). In the last two weeks I have started experiencing EXTREME heat/electrical shock type of pain in my right leg just above my outer ankle bone. It started only radiating up about four inches above my ankle but is now going further up my leg and lasting longer. Is this a characteristic of MS? Also, is there any connection between MS and Raynaud's Disease and MS? I've suffered with this for over 20 years and it gets more difficult all the time. My Neurologist wants me to undergo the five day IV steroid therapy but every MS patient I've talked to say it just gives you a ""false and temporary burst of energy."" I hesitate to pump steroids in to my body, I already take 18 pills a day. Any thoughts?

Even when receiving very good skin care, research has shown that the number of skin wounds rises due to risk factors such as lack of movement and muscle spasms, taking in less food and fluid, a weak immune system, loss of the ability to feel pain, and loss of bowel and bladder control. This section provides tips and advice on caring for skin. Your role may be ‘hands-on’, i.e. checking the skin for signs of redness or irritation, applying moisturizing creams, changing dressings, turning and positioning, or applying booties, lambskin or other pressure reducing surfaces in order to prevent or treat pressure sores. Or your role could be one of “manager”, i.e., supervising home health staff, or calling nurses or other health care professionals regarding skin status in order to ensure that appropriate care is being provided. At the earliest sign of skin breakdown contact your GP or Public Health Nurse immediately. 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|Skin|Care	MS|Ireland|::|.|In|advanced|stages|of|MS|,|a|person|’|s|skin|is|more|likely|to|break|down|.|Even|when|receiving|very|good|skin|care|,|research|has|shown|that|the|number|of|skin|wounds|rises|due|to|risk|factors|such|as|lack|of|movement|and|muscle|spasms|,|taking|in|less|food|and|fluid|,|a|weak|immune|system|,|loss|of|the|ability|to|feel|pain|,|and|loss|of|bowel|and|bladder|control|.|This|section|provides|tips|and|advice|on|caring|for|skin|.|Your|role|may|be|‘|hands-on|’|,|i|.|e|.|checking|the|skin|for|signs|of|redness|or|irritation|,|applying|moisturizing|creams|,|changing|dressings|,|turning|and|positioning|,|or|applying|booties|,|lambskin|or|other|pressure|reducing|surfaces|in|order|to|prevent|or|treat|pressure|sores|.|Or|your|role|could|be|one|of|“|manager|”|,|i|.|e|.|,|supervising|home|health|staff|,|or|calling|nurses|or|other|health|care|professionals|regarding|skin|status|in|order|to|ensure|that|appropriate|care|is|being|provided|.|At|the|earliest|sign|of|skin|breakdown|contact|your|GP|or|Public|Health|Nurse|immediately|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531477892585878/MS-Ireland--::-Dealing-with-Emotions	MS Ireland  :: Dealing with Emotions	MS Ireland  ::. Dealing with Emotions. Providing emotional support and physical care for someone with MS can be deeply rewarding. It can also be overwhelming. The strain of balancing care with other responsibilities can lead to feelings of martyrdom, anger, depression and guilt. One of the biggest mistakes Care Givers make is thinking they can handle everything alone. The key thing to remember is that you have to take care of yourself, too. If you don't, you may find it challenging to be a successful caregiver. Caring for someone with multiple sclerosis (MS) can be as deeply satisfying as it is emotionally and physically exhausting. Most people with MS don't become so severely disabled that they require long-term care full time. But MS is unpredictable, and each person's experience with MS is different. Regardless of what kind of care a person with MS needs, it's important to remember that you — the caregiver — and the person you're caring for are in this together. Like any healthy relationship, this requires work from both of you. Dealing with your emotions considerations. 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|Dealing|with|Emotions	MS|Ireland|::|.|Dealing|with|Emotions|.|Providing|emotional|support|and|physical|care|for|someone|with|MS|can|be|deeply|rewarding|.|It|can|also|be|overwhelming|.|The|strain|of|balancing|care|with|other|responsibilities|can|lead|to|feelings|of|martyrdom|,|anger|,|depression|and|guilt|.|One|of|the|biggest|mistakes|Care|Givers|make|is|thinking|they|can|handle|everything|alone|.|The|key|thing|to|remember|is|that|you|have|to|take|care|of|yourself|,|too|.|If|you|don't|,|you|may|find|it|challenging|to|be|a|successful|caregiver|.|Caring|for|someone|with|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|can|be|as|deeply|satisfying|as|it|is|emotionally|and|physically|exhausting|.|Most|people|with|MS|don't|become|so|severely|disabled|that|they|require|long-term|care|full|time|.|But|MS|is|unpredictable|,|and|each|person's|experience|with|MS|is|different|.|Regardless|of|what|kind|of|care|a|person|with|MS|needs|,|it's|important|to|remember|that|you|—|the|caregiver|—|and|the|person|you're|caring|for|are|in|this|together|.|Like|any|healthy|relationship|,|this|requires|work|from|both|of|you|.|Dealing|with|your|emotions|considerations|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531541176443105/MS-Ireland--::-Better-Balance-Programme	MS Ireland  :: Better Balance Programme	MS Ireland  ::. Better Balance Programme. Many people with multiple sclerosis experience falls, which can have significant consequences for the individual. The MS Research Team at the University of Limerick, led by Professor Susan Coote, have developed a falls prevention programme for people with multiple sclerosis and we would like to assess how suitable and effective the programme is. What do I have to do? The 'Better Balance' programme consists of 12 weeks of twice-weekly classes run by a chartered physiotherapist. The classes will consist of 45 minutes of exercises aimed at improving balance, strength and walking and 45 minutes of education on topics such as fear of falling, task analysis, getting up from the floor, what devices can assist you – these will include group discussions and problem solving. There will also be a home exercise programme provided to each participant. The classes will take place in Limerick and Galway and will be offered in the morning and/or evening depending on the preference of the individuals attending. Beginning in January, interested individuals will be asked to attend an assessment day where a chartered physiotherapist will test your strength, balance, walking and feelings about falls. We will then give you falls diaries to complete for two months. This is like a calendar where you will write down if you had a fall. After these two months, the classes will begin. When the 12 weeks of classes are finished you will again have your strength, balance, walking and feelings about falls assessed and complete another two months of falls diaries to see if the intervention has been successful. After completing the two months of falls diaries you will attend one last assessment with the researcher to assess your strength, balance, walking and feelings about falls. Who can participate? To be eligible to take part you must have multiple sclerosis, be over the age of 18 years, have experienced a fall in the last three months, and be able to walk for 10 metres with or without a walking aid (one stick or one crutch). Get in touch. If you would be interested in taking part in this study or have any further questions about the study you can contact the researchers by calling Laura Comber on 086 0231335 or email Laura.comber@ul.ie or Prof. Susan Coote on (061) 234278 or email susan.coote@ul.ie. 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|Better|Balance|Programme	MS|Ireland|::|.|Better|Balance|Programme|.|Many|people|with|multiple|sclerosis|experience|falls|,|which|can|have|significant|consequences|for|the|individual|.|The|MS|Research|Team|at|the|University|of|Limerick|,|led|by|Professor|Susan|Coote|,|have|developed|a|falls|prevention|programme|for|people|with|multiple|sclerosis|and|we|would|like|to|assess|how|suitable|and|effective|the|programme|is|.|What|do|I|have|to|do|?|The|'|Better|Balance|'|programme|consists|of|12|weeks|of|twice-weekly|classes|run|by|a|chartered|physiotherapist|.|The|classes|will|consist|of|45|minutes|of|exercises|aimed|at|improving|balance|,|strength|and|walking|and|45|minutes|of|education|on|topics|such|as|fear|of|falling|,|task|analysis|,|getting|up|from|the|floor|,|what|devices|can|assist|you|–|these|will|include|group|discussions|and|problem|solving|.|There|will|also|be|a|home|exercise|programme|provided|to|each|participant|.|The|classes|will|take|place|in|Limerick|and|Galway|and|will|be|offered|in|the|morning|and|/|or|evening|depending|on|the|preference|of|the|individuals|attending|.|Beginning|in|January|,|interested|individuals|will|be|asked|to|attend|an|assessment|day|where|a|chartered|physiotherapist|will|test|your|strength|,|balance|,|walking|and|feelings|about|falls|.|We|will|then|give|you|falls|diaries|to|complete|for|two|months|.|This|is|like|a|calendar|where|you|will|write|down|if|you|had|a|fall|.|After|these|two|months|,|the|classes|will|begin|.|When|the|12|weeks|of|classes|are|finished|you|will|again|have|your|strength|,|balance|,|walking|and|feelings|about|falls|assessed|and|complete|another|two|months|of|falls|diaries|to|see|if|the|intervention|has|been|successful|.|After|completing|the|two|months|of|falls|diaries|you|will|attend|one|last|assessment|with|the|researcher|to|assess|your|strength|,|balance|,|walking|and|feelings|about|falls|.|Who|can|participate|?|To|be|eligible|to|take|part|you|must|have|multiple|sclerosis|,|be|over|the|age|of|18|years|,|have|experienced|a|fall|in|the|last|three|months|,|and|be|able|to|walk|for|10|metres|with|or|without|a|walking|aid|(|one|stick|or|one|crutch|)|.|Get|in|touch|.|If|you|would|be|interested|in|taking|part|in|this|study|or|have|any|further|questions|about|the|study|you|can|contact|the|researchers|by|calling|Laura|Comber|on|086 0231335|or|email|Laura.comber@ul.ie|or|Prof|.|Susan|Coote|on|(|061) 2342|78|or|email|susan.coote@ul.ie|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531564413412493/MS-Ireland--::-Nursing-Home-Care	MS Ireland  :: Nursing Home Care	MS Ireland  ::. Nursing Home Care. MS is a disease that can progress to a point where, not only is 24 hour care necessary, but 24 hour skilled nursing care is essential. At this point the needs of the person with MS frequently exceed family resources. Significant cognitive loss, incontinence, nutritional compromise, and/or respiratory issues require complex clinical care. Care Givers may no longer be able to carry the burden for a variety of reasons, even with additional assistance at home. In this section we take a closer look at nursing home care and what to anticipate if that choice needs to be made. * I feel guilty even thinking about a nursing home for my loved one. How can I get to the point of even considering this as an option ? Nursing Home Support Scheme – Fair Deal. The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, also known as the “Fair Deal” scheme is a scheme of financial support for people who need long term residential care services. Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, people make a contribution towards the cost of their care and the State pays the balance. The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is administered by the HSE in line with the legislation (Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009) and within the resources made available for the Scheme. Applicants cannot avail of State funding for a nursing home place prior to receiving approval of their Fair Deal application. Under the Nursing Home Support Scheme, prices charged by Private Nursing Homes are agreed between the Private Nursing Home and the National Treatment Purchase Fund. A weekly price for the cost of care in Public Homes is also provided. More information on the Nursing Home Support Scheme, including details of how to apply, is found here. 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|Nursing|Home|Care	MS|Ireland|::|.|Nursing|Home|Care|.|MS|is|a|disease|that|can|progress|to|a|point|where|,|not|only|is|24|hour|care|necessary|,|but|24|hour|skilled|nursing|care|is|essential|.|At|this|point|the|needs|of|the|person|with|MS|frequently|exceed|family|resources|.|Significant|cognitive|loss|,|incontinence|,|nutritional|compromise|,|and|/|or|respiratory|issues|require|complex|clinical|care|.|Care|Givers|may|no|longer|be|able|to|carry|the|burden|for|a|variety|of|reasons|,|even|with|additional|assistance|at|home|.|In|this|section|we|take|a|closer|look|at|nursing|home|care|and|what|to|anticipate|if|that|choice|needs|to|be|made|.|*|I|feel|guilty|even|thinking|about|a|nursing|home|for|my|loved|one|.|How|can|I|get|to|the|point|of|even|considering|this|as|an|option|?|Nursing|Home|Support|Scheme|–|Fair|Deal|.|The|Nursing|Homes|Support|Scheme|,|also|known|as|the|“|Fair|Deal|”|scheme|is|a|scheme|of|financial|support|for|people|who|need|long|term|residential|care|services|.|Under|the|Nursing|Homes|Support|Scheme|,|people|make|a|contribution|towards|the|cost|of|their|care|and|the|State|pays|the|balance|.|The|Nursing|Homes|Support|Scheme|is|administered|by|the|HSE|in|line|with|the|legislation|(|Nursing|Homes|Support|Scheme|Act|2009|)|and|within|the|resources|made|available|for|the|Scheme|.|Applicants|cannot|avail|of|State|funding|for|a|nursing|home|place|prior|to|receiving|approval|of|their|Fair|Deal|application|.|Under|the|Nursing|Home|Support|Scheme|,|prices|charged|by|Private|Nursing|Homes|are|agreed|between|the|Private|Nursing|Home|and|the|National|Treatment|Purchase|Fund|.|A|weekly|price|for|the|cost|of|care|in|Public|Homes|is|also|provided|.|More|information|on|the|Nursing|Home|Support|Scheme|,|including|details|of|how|to|apply|,|is|found|here|.

We are particularly excited about our new team of dedicated Education Officers who, as part of our School Visit Programme, will be visiting schools across the country over the coming months. We hope you will find this resource useful and insightful. MS Ireland Education Officers will be delivering two presentations, outlined below, to suit your class needs. 1. CSPE. Understanding Rights is an integral part of the CSPE curriculum and MS Ireland has developed a specific talk on the rights of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and other neurodegenerative diseases. This is based specifically on the criteria for the CSPE Action Project. This presentation will give students an insight into current issues facing people with MS as well as providing up to date facts and statistics. Students will also learn about some interesting ideas for research, advocacy and awareness campaigns and events that could be organised as part of the Action Project. 2. Transition Year. MS Ireland has developed a presentation for TY students which may be particularly useful for students who may be taking part in the Young Social Innovators Programme. The presentation is based on MS and the work of our organisation featuring statistics about MS, case studies and video clips from people of various ages who tell a personal story about living with MS. Each presentation including Q&A time takes only 35 minutes so it can easily fit into your class time. Get in touch.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531548384553649/MS-Ireland--::-Our-History	MS Ireland  :: Our History	MS Ireland  ::. History of MS Ireland. In 1961 Dr. Brian Pringle founded the MS Society in Dublin. Dr. Pringle was at that time a renowned General Practitioner with a great interest in Multiple Sclerosis. He was concerned about the disease but also its effects on those principally affected and indeed the other far-reaching side effects. Dr. Pringle went on to play a leading role in the formation of the International Federation of MS Societies, which today is the standard bearer for MS Societies across the world. The initial meeting, which was the consequence of a newspaper advertisement, was held in Lumsden Hall, in Dublin in February 1961. This meeting was well attended and momentum quickly gathered resulting in the first Annual General Meeting taking place on 8th June 1961. The Society moved into offices at 14, Merrion Sq. from where services would be administered for the next twenty years. The task of building the organisation into a vibrant support group was begun. The establishment of branches and the overall advocacy on behalf of persons and families affected by Multiple Sclerosis was to be the main thrust of the new Society. It is interesting to note that even back then there was mention of cutbacks, lack of sufficient services, home helps etc. At the end of 1982 the Society on celebrating 21 years of service made two momentous decisions. It decided to set up new office structures and to move to establish Community Services by introducing community workers to support the client base of the Society. The premises were purchased in Sandymount Green towards the end of 1982 with the aid of what was a substantial bequest at that time. The editor of MS News of the period wrote “Sandymount Green will give the Society room to grow, it will be a base for expansion of services and the membership will no longer feel excluded or embarrassed by stairs or steps”. Some of the strong personalities who were involved with the Society during the early years, apart from Brian Pringle were, Rory Whelan, Leo Markey, Irene Brindley RIP, Maura Lillis, Tom Breen, Vivien Lloyd Blood and Irving Stewart. Towards the end of the 80’s MS Care established a Respite Centre dedicated to persons with Multiple Sclerosis in Ireland. A premises was purchased with the aid of a Dept of Health grant in 1989 at 65, Bushy Park Road in Dublin and converted into a centre of excellence providing respite and eventually rehabilitation for persons with Multiple Sclerosis and other neurological disabilities. The progress of the centre continued into the nineties with the able assistance of the ‘Friends of MS Group’ who provided much needed financial assistance. People to the fore during this period were Tom Connors RIP, Mary Allen RIP, Carmel Stenson, James O’Driscoll RIP, Ned Burke and Mervyn Taylor. In April 1982, Brian Pringle passed on to his eternal reward leaving in his wake a legacy of service and dedication in the field of MS, which will be difficult to surpass. Into the nineties the emphasis was on constitutional change. Brendan Ingoldsby was recruited on secondment from the Dept of Health & Children. The Society hosted a major International Conference of MS Societies, still regarded today as one of the most successful ever organised and support was also given to the emergence of a platform of MS Societies in Europe. The organisation suffered a severe downturn in its structure in 1993 when some fundraising events failed and as a result a number of personnel departed. Procedures were put in place to redress this situation over the following three years and these were by and large successful. Consideration was given to securing the legal status of the Society and forming closer ties with MS Care. Heads of Agreement were drawn up in 1997. On 19th November 1998 a new limited company was formed with William Lonergan as Chairman of the Board and Michael Dineen as Chief Executive. This company took over all the assets, liabilities and undertakings of the former MS Ireland and the MS Care Foundation (which previously managed the Care Centre). During this period, the Society owes a debt of gratitude to Paul Hogan, Niall O’Carroll, Howard Cusack RIP, Brendan Kenna RIP, Eileen Barry RIP, Martin Nolan, Fr. Jimmy Doherty RIP, Peter Gatenby RIP, William Lonergan and John Paul. By 1998 the Society had agreed to sell Sandymount Green, a matter, which was finalised in September of 1999 when the National Office moved temporarily to the grounds of the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook. It was at this point decided to source a permanent base for MS Ireland, which would also cater for the growing service need of the membership. It was originally hoped that the Bushy Park site might accommodate all of the need but this was quickly discounted. The MS Resource Centre was purchased to house the Society’s administrative offices at 80 Northumberland Road, Dublin 4. The MS Care Centre was extended and upgraded. MS Ireland has 10 regional offices. We are very grateful to all our volunteers who work with the organisation for the benefit of People with MS. There are 34 volunteer branches within MS Ireland. There is continued demand for our services and we look forward to the day when we shall no longer be needed because a cure will have been found for Multiple Sclerosis.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531536528013763/MS-Ireland--::-Who-Is-A-Carer?	MS Ireland  :: Who Is A Carer?	MS Ireland  ::. Who Is A Carer? You Are A Care Giver If You:. When The Person You Care For Is An Adult. The person you care for has the right to make decisions about his or her life. You should respect that right unless your loved one has lost the capacity to make decisions or could put others in danger through his or her behaviour. In December 2015, the Government passed the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act. This new Act, when commenced, will have significant implications for people who are caring for someone whose capacity to make decisions may be impaired. The Act provides a statutory framework for individuals who have impaired capacity or may have impaired capacity in the future to make legally-binding agreements to be assisted and supported in making decisions about their welfare and their property and affairs. More information is available here. When a Parent is a Care Giver. The return of an adult child to the home can be stressful for both the parents and the adult child. Often, this homecoming reproduces the earlier joys or struggles that may have occurred before the child became independent. This may result in the early days of such a move being a very emotive experience for both the parent/s and the adult child. It may be prudent for the family to have good support if needed at this time to get the new situation off to a good start. Parents probably have rules that they want to have respected. But the adult child needs to be treated as an adult, and some rules may presume the wrong kind of dependence. As parents age, providing care often becomes more difficult. In time, one or both parents may become ill and require care themselves. Alternative care plans and living arrangements should be discussed with the adult child well before such a crisis occurs. Parents can also care without the adult child returning home, especially if they live nearby, but also long-distance by visiting, staying over, phoning, listening, providing respite for the main carer, etc. When a Child is a Care Giver. A young carer is under the age of 18 and provides care for a family or household member who has an illness, disability, addiction or other care need. The young carer may be the main carer in the home or else helps the main carer. A young carer may do a lot of things, including household chores, medical care, help with toileting and bathing or emotional support. The need to carry out these tasks may happen regularly or only occasionally. Therefore, no two caring situations are the same. Sometimes caring is a mostly positive experience but in other cases caring can have a negative effect on a young person’s health, development and happiness. When a member of your family is diagnosed with MS you will probably experience lots of changes. There may be lots of different professionals involved with your family and relationships between family members can change, even if only for a short while. After diagnosis, some people are glad to find out what is actually wrong with them. However, it is also usual for them, and their family, to have a whole range of feelings – such as shock, anger, sadness or fear – about MS. This may mean people are upset or are short tempered. Remember that even the people who haven’t got MS have to live with it. So if it’s your dad who has MS, your mum or dad may both be sad and scared. The Young Carers Association provides a range of information and support services for young carers, including information and advice, needs assessments of young carers and their families, group work for young carers, education and employment support, peer mentoring, respite activity breaks and online support.

In advanced MS, there is often weight loss or very poor dietary intake. These problems can be attributed to swallowing problems, depression, fatigue, side effects of medications, shaking/tremors, and/or cognitive changes. It is not uncommon for individuals to become dehydrated along with consuming too few calories. People with MS can become dehydrated very quickly. This section addresses nutrition and eating.

While some changes can be challenging such as the need for more help around the house, others can be very rewarding such as new hobbies discovered with family members. For a family to live with MS in the most positive way, the first stage is telling your family. The process of telling family members can sometimes be difficult. They may have lots of questions that you don’t know that answer to. They may also become upset, especially if they don't know anything about MS. Before you discuss your diagnosis with members of your family, you need to consider how you think they will react. It may be helpful to have information pamphlets available to help talk about MS and to explain what MS is. Parents often choose not to tell their children about their MS. Naturally, they do not want to frighten their children or cause them undue concern. However, children are very good at picking up changes in moods, over-hearing conversations or responding to body language, and without the appropriate information, they imagine much worse things and become upset. For children and teenagers with MS, telling family can be especially difficult. It can be an emotional process as family members feel that life will change dramatically for the young person. Most children and teenagers will rely on their parents or guardians to help them with the telling process, so it is important that both parties are comfortable with talking about the subject.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531961693518374/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	"My MS story began in college. I started noticing fatigue - both mental and physical. Whenever I walked to class (or any place where the distance was a quarter mile or more), I would get tingly sensations in my legs that felt weird but harmless - not unlike the sensation fizzy beverages have when they hit your tongue. I must add, I was following the typical diet of a careless engineering student: cheap beer, fast food, ramen, all manner of large burrito, you get the idea. This only further exacerbated problems mostly related to evacuatory functions. After grad school, I moved out west to the San Francisco Bay Area and I worked in the tech sector. It was here that I started to notice, especially when I was in the sun for any extended period of time, that my tolerance for alcohol was reduced to almost nothing. Because of this, and also because I was in poor health, I made significant lifestyle changes: I ate healthier and started swimming, lifting weights, and finally doing yoga. God I love yoga. It's this magic exercise that contains none of the monotony of other workouts (IMO). I found friends in the yoga community and travelled with them up and down the bay area doing yoga. I was working at a renewable energy firm and I actually taught yoga to my fellow employees during lunch. In 2012, walking started to become more and more difficult and at the end of July I was formally diagnosed. Work became harder and harder and I was eventually let go. I tried to reinvent myself, rooming with close friends in San Francisco, but walking difficulties precluded most activities in that hilly city. Depression set in, and eventually I stopped trying to be active - leading to muscle atrophy. Without the support of my friends (and the words of Herman Melville) I don't know if I'd still be around. Eventually, financial circumstances forced me to move back home to Michigan last year. But things have gotten a lot better. I'm trying to eat a nutritious (and rigorous) paleo diet, I'm on tysabri, I'm building up leg strength (with yoga - obviously, amongst other things) and I'm reengaging with electrical engineering and renewable energy. I'm hoping to work full time again in the near future. My dreams are simple: I want to be an engineer (researching renewable energy), eat a healthy paleo diet (not unlike Terry Wahls' plan), float up to handstand in yoga, and read as much as I can. I eventually would like to meet someone who loves yoga, books & classical music. One last thing: My site name - Agathon, is after a greek poet who spoke at Plato's first symposium. I don't know much about him except his name is in Leonard Bernstein's violin concerto: ""Serenade."" Bernstein uses his name to symbolize all forms of love, be it romantic or platonic and it's awesome power to connect. Check out the piece, especially the movement named Agathon. When I listen to it, no matter my mood, I realize that world cannot be that terrible if something so wonderful exists.

I ignored them as best I could, endured years of tremors, body instability, foot drops, numb right side, blurry vision, and I was sent to chiropractors and given blood pressure meds for tremors, but could not get answers. In the past 2 years, the flare ups have gotten increasingly worse, until now they are interfering with my daily life. I am a classroom teacher, but almost unable to make crafts due to trembling in my hands. Even putting toothpaste on my brush is sometimes almost impossible. Instead of support, I’ve gotten laughs from friends and family... but I never held it against anyone... I also tried to laugh it off. My principal finally noticed that I was favoring my right side, something I ddin’t even notice... and I’m at the end of my rope. I was just FINALLY diagnosed, and am now receiving treatment. I finally have a voice, and I finally have a focal point for my frustration and for finding alleviation. Teaching is my LIFE... and I only want to continue doing that. I don’t think my story is unique or makes me special... and I am not a victim.

I broke my nose in high school and rolled my leg in my hip on the fire department so I figured the really bad eye pains and foot drop was from that stuff happening before it so I just figured I would get it looked at later. Finally when I was dizzy and light headed for a month I went and got looked at and was diagnosed 3 months before my 21st birthday. I am on my third medicine which is Tysabri. They were not able to get my MS under control for just over a year and it is still not completly under control but a lot better so I got a lot worse than I was. I haven't been able to work in over a year because of it. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	It|either|started|in|high|school|or|just|out|when|I|got|on|my|local|volunteer|fire|department|.|I|broke|my|nose|in|high|school|and|rolled|my|leg|in|my|hip|on|the|fire|department|so|I|figured|the|really|bad|eye|pains|and|foot|drop|was|from|that|stuff|happening|before|it|so|I|just|figured|I|would|get|it|looked|at|later|.|Finally|when|I|was|dizzy|and|light|headed|for|a|month|I|went|and|got|looked|at|and|was|diagnosed|3|months|before|my|21st|birthday|.|I|am|on|my|third|medicine|which|is|Tysabri|.|They|were|not|able|to|get|my|MS|under|control|for|just|over|a|year|and|it|is|still|not|completly|under|control|but|a|lot|better|so|I|got|a|lot|worse|than|I|was|.|I|haven't|been|able|to|work|in|over|a|year|because|of|it|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531481175162397/MS-Ireland--::-Governance-Update	MS Ireland  :: Governance Update	MS Ireland  ::. In light of the recent media stories on the charity sector I think it’s important to give you a sense of our commitment to good governance. We want to reassure you that MS Ireland is transparent, ethical and has on-going and effective audit processes in place. We value every donation we receive and are always mindful that it is our duty to use the money to achieve the biggest possible impact for people living with MS. Our diligence around governance makes recent news stories even more frustrating as they have the potential to negatively impact the work we do to enable and empower people effected by MS to live the life of their choice to their fullest potential. Here are some facts for you about our governance:. * The Board hold meetings 6 times a year with the Chief Executive in attendance at those meetings. The Chief Executive reports to the Board but is not a member of the Board. MS Ireland’s Code of Practice details the process on the selection and rotation of Board members, the roles and duties of the Chairperson and Chief Executive. We require formal disclosure of Directors' interests at meetings. We have a committed and strong Board, currently made up of 80% people living with MS or family members. They give their time for free and receive no payments for their work. However, Board members’ are entitled to draw for travel and subsistence expenses in attending meetings. In 2015 Board members expenses were €3,078 (2014: €2,079). No emoluments are paid to Board members. The list of Board members can be found here. * We adhere to the ICTR (Irish Charities Tax Research) Guiding Principles for Fundraising . The principles set the standard for best practice in fundraising in Ireland. There is more detail about our governance and management here . In conclusion, MS Ireland would like to assure you that we take our responsibilities in this area seriously and we will continue to do so in to the future to reflect the trust you have placed in us over so many years.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695735021561977328/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	Not really sure where to start or what to say but I will keep it brief. I was officially diagnosed with ms in July 2011 after experiencing optical neuritis on my right eye. It was my second episode of optic neuritis. However my first episode which I had 9 years ago came back clear when I had my brain scan. Between the time of both episodes I started experiencing numerous symptoms of ms including tingling, pain in certain parts of my body and wrestles legs. My bladder also became weak. Up until I was diagnosed in 2011 I had numerous visits to the doctors to be told I was just suffering from anxiety which left me feeling very upset and frustrated. When I was finally diagnosed in 2011 been only 25 years of age I thought this was the end of the world. I had to take on consoling as I wanted to take my own life. Nearly 5 years on I am coping okay now that I have been prescribed 3 different medications to help manage my symptoms but the fact that I have chosen to keep my condition confidential makes me feel very lonely. There's only my family and a couple of close friends that I have told about my condition as I do not want to be judged and want to be able to live a normal life. I am hoping to be able to discuss my condition on here with other members who are also suffering with ms that are experiencing similar symptoms so that I don't feel so alone. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	Not|really|sure|where|to|start|or|what|to|say|but|I|will|keep|it|brief|.|I|was|officially|diagnosed|with|ms|in|July|2011|after|experiencing|optical|neuritis|on|my|right|eye|.|It|was|my|second|episode|of|optic|neuritis|.|However|my|first|episode|which|I|had|9|years|ago|came|back|clear|when|I|had|my|brain|scan|.|Between|the|time|of|both|episodes|I|started|experiencing|numerous|symptoms|of|ms|including|tingling|,|pain|in|certain|parts|of|my|body|and|wrestles|legs|.|My|bladder|also|became|weak|.|Up|until|I|was|diagnosed|in|2011|I|had|numerous|visits|to|the|doctors|to|be|told|I|was|just|suffering|from|anxiety|which|left|me|feeling|very|upset|and|frustrated|.|When|I|was|finally|diagnosed|in|2011|been|only|25|years|of|age|I|thought|this|was|the|end|of|the|world|.|I|had|to|take|on|consoling|as|I|wanted|to|take|my|own|life|.|Nearly|5|years|on|I|am|coping|okay|now|that|I|have|been|prescribed|3|different|medications|to|help|manage|my|symptoms|but|the|fact|that|I|have|chosen|to|keep|my|condition|confidential|makes|me|feel|very|lonely|.|There's|only|my|family|and|a|couple|of|close|friends|that|I|have|told|about|my|condition|as|I|do|not|want|to|be|judged|and|want|to|be|able|to|live|a|normal|life|.|I|am|hoping|to|be|able|to|discuss|my|condition|on|here|with|other|members|who|are|also|suffering|with|ms|that|are|experiencing|similar|symptoms|so|that|I|don't|feel|so|alone|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531539845948393/MS-Ireland--::-Sex-Intimacy-and-relationships	MS Ireland  :: Sex Intimacy and relationships	MS Ireland  ::. Sex Intimacy and relationships. Sex, Intimacy and Relationships. Although sexual difficulties can affect the population as a whole, multiple sclerosis (MS) can bring about particular problems for both men and women. Not everyone with MS will experience sexual problems and, as with other MS symptoms, it is impossible to predict who will be affected and how long symptoms may last. One of the reasons for sexual difficulties being more common among people with MS is that sexual arousal, response and orgasm require messages to be sent between the brain and sexual organs, via the spinal cord. If there is MS-related nerve damage in the parts of the brain and spinal cord that are involved, sexual function may be affected. Sexuality – that is, how we think of and express ourselves sexually – may also be affected by MS. Physical symptoms like fatigue and spasms, and psychological factors such as low self-esteem and mood, can also affect sexual activity and desire. Other things in life unrelated to MS, such as having children and getting older, may also play a role. As many factors may be involved, sexual problems vary a great deal between people with MS, and it may be hard to identify a single cause for a particular problem. However, understanding of MS-related sexual problems has improved greatly in recent years, and various treatments are now available. Getting accurate information and communicating openly with your partner and professionals can also help to minimise problems. If difficulties have already developed, there are techniques that can improve communication and understanding, and help you to adapt to new dynamics within your relationships. Many people, both with and without MS, have successful and satisfying relationships despite experiencing sexual difficulties. Useful links and resources:.

I was sitting at work and dealing with major dizziness. I was later evaluated and treated with vertigo not knowing that in that moment, my life would change forever.... Luckily for me, I work in the healthcare field and am around doctors daily. I told one of the doctors my symptoms and he immediately started sending me for testing. One of which was a MRI of my brain. My first initial MRI came back with having lesions on my brain. I was sent to a Neurologist. My major symptom at that time was dizziness, then came the severe fatigue, followed by vision problems, hearing loss, headaches, trouble swallowing, weak muscles, tingling, numbness and balance issues. It's been a long road thus far and I know I have an even longer one ahead of me. I have 2 young children and want whats best for them for the future. I am going back to school and changing my major from nursing to social work. I always tell myself to smile because it could always be worse.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531539560443418/MS-Ireland--::-Anger-and-Abuse	MS Ireland  :: Anger and Abuse	MS Ireland  ::. Anger and Abuse. Anger is a common Care Giver Emotion. The situation feels and is unfair. Hurtful words might be spoken during a difficult task, doors might be slammed during a disagreement, and shouting in frustration sometimes replaces conversation. Anger and frustration needs to be addressed and healthy outlets need to be developed before angry encounters become physically or emotionally abusive. Abusive Behaviour Is Never Acceptable. Tensions, though, can mount in the most loving of families. While circumstances that produce frustration and anger are often unavoidable, an emotionally damaging or physically aggressive response is not okay. If tensions are mounting, call for a time-out, and call for help. Physical abuse usually begins in the context of giving or getting personal help—the Care Giver might be too rough during dressing or grooming. The person with MS might scratch a Care Giver during a transfer. Once anger and frustration reach this level, abuse by either partner can become more frequent. The dangers of physical abuse are obvious, but emotional abuse is also unhealthy and damaging. Continued humiliation, harsh criticism, or manipulative behaviours can undermine the self-esteem of both Care Givers and care receivers. Therapists and marriage counsellors can help families when tensions get to this level. 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|Anger|and|Abuse	MS|Ireland|::|.|Anger|and|Abuse|.|Anger|is|a|common|Care|Giver|Emotion|.|The|situation|feels|and|is|unfair|.|Hurtful|words|might|be|spoken|during|a|difficult|task|,|doors|might|be|slammed|during|a|disagreement|,|and|shouting|in|frustration|sometimes|replaces|conversation|.|Anger|and|frustration|needs|to|be|addressed|and|healthy|outlets|need|to|be|developed|before|angry|encounters|become|physically|or|emotionally|abusive|.|Abusive|Behaviour|Is|Never|Acceptable|.|Tensions|,|though|,|can|mount|in|the|most|loving|of|families|.|While|circumstances|that|produce|frustration|and|anger|are|often|unavoidable|,|an|emotionally|damaging|or|physically|aggressive|response|is|not|okay|.|If|tensions|are|mounting|,|call|for|a|time-out|,|and|call|for|help|.|Physical|abuse|usually|begins|in|the|context|of|giving|or|getting|personal|help|—|the|Care|Giver|might|be|too|rough|during|dressing|or|grooming|.|The|person|with|MS|might|scratch|a|Care|Giver|during|a|transfer|.|Once|anger|and|frustration|reach|this|level|,|abuse|by|either|partner|can|become|more|frequent|.|The|dangers|of|physical|abuse|are|obvious|,|but|emotional|abuse|is|also|unhealthy|and|damaging|.|Continued|humiliation|,|harsh|criticism|,|or|manipulative|behaviours|can|undermine|the|self-esteem|of|both|Care|Givers|and|care|receivers|.|Therapists|and|marriage|counsellors|can|help|families|when|tensions|get|to|this|level|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4699274738101149316/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	I began having symptoms about four years ago. I was initially diagnosised with Bell’s palsy at that time. As time went on I had different areas of numbness. Begrudgingly I went to the doctor after my upper torso and arm went numb. Everything after that happened pretty fast. I was praying it was a B12 deficiency but when the blood test came back normal I had a sick feeling it was MS. The doctor confirmed it, without having to do a spinal tap (silver lining?). My biggest challenge so far is the “why me” thoughts. I do believe in God and I know he is good I just don’t understand any of this. But I suppose it’s not for me to understand. Friends and family have been surrounding me with love and support.

After leaving the army I ventured in to starting my own business in the Information Security Industry, I hold a Master's Degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology life was great.... Then I noticed numbness in my arm isolated to my ulnar nerve. I thought to myself ok this is very common in my field so suck it up and drive on, after 2 years of numbness I started to feel like my calves were packed full of jelly numbness and tingling in my legs, again suck it up and drive on solider. After two years of pain numbness tingling and fatigue out of the blue I developed Diplopia and thought to myself wow this is kind of scary! After taking it easy for a few days I threw on an eyepatch and continued to work while waiting for my Doctor's Appointment, needless to say I did not make it and ended up at Vanderbilt Hospital, then the pretty glowing spots on my MRI's told the tale, confirmed with an LP, my enemy was identified and given a name. By this time the damage was done. I have since slowed down in life seeing that yes, I was a great provider for my child, but if I am to be a single Dad with MS I needed to give my child what I have while I still have it. I am here to seek fellowship among others who share this battle with me! It has cause my life to change dramatically but not so much that I have lost sight of what I can offer my child and others. I have since closed up shop, and devoted myself to my son and doing what I can to contribute to society in a positive way. Instead of letting this BS called MS get me down I channel it and use it to fight another war, hopefully with as many other people with MS I can enlist! but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	I|am|a|former|Army|Ranger|,|now|tech|nerd|.|After|leaving|the|army|I|ventured|in|to|starting|my|own|business|in|the|Information|Security|Industry|,|I|hold|a|Master's|Degree|from|the|Massachusetts|Institute|of|Technology|life|was|great|...|Then|I|noticed|numbness|in|my|arm|isolated|to|my|ulnar|nerve|.|I|thought|to|myself|ok|this|is|very|common|in|my|field|so|suck|it|up|and|drive|on|,|after|2|years|of|numbness|I|started|to|feel|like|my|calves|were|packed|full|of|jelly|numbness|and|tingling|in|my|legs|,|again|suck|it|up|and|drive|on|solider|.|After|two|years|of|pain|numbness|tingling|and|fatigue|out|of|the|blue|I|developed|Diplopia|and|thought|to|myself|wow|this|is|kind|of|scary|!|After|taking|it|easy|for|a|few|days|I|threw|on|an|eyepatch|and|continued|to|work|while|waiting|for|my|Doctor's|Appointment|,|needless|to|say|I|did|not|make|it|and|ended|up|at|Vanderbilt|Hospital|,|then|the|pretty|glowing|spots|on|my|MRI's|told|the|tale|,|confirmed|with|an|LP|,|my|enemy|was|identified|and|given|a|name|.|By|this|time|the|damage|was|done|.|I|have|since|slowed|down|in|life|seeing|that|yes|,|I|was|a|great|provider|for|my|child|,|but|if|I|am|to|be|a|single|Dad|with|MS|I|needed|to|give|my|child|what|I|have|while|I|still|have|it|.|I|am|here|to|seek|fellowship|among|others|who|share|this|battle|with|me|!|It|has|cause|my|life|to|change|dramatically|but|not|so|much|that|I|have|lost|sight|of|what|I|can|offer|my|child|and|others|.|I|have|since|closed|up|shop|,|and|devoted|myself|to|my|son|and|doing|what|I|can|to|contribute|to|society|in|a|positive|way|.|Instead|of|letting|this|BS|called|MS|get|me|down|I|channel|it|and|use|it|to|fight|another|war|,|hopefully|with|as|many|other|people|with|MS|I|can|enlist|!|but|those|who|hope|in|the|Lord|will|renew|their|strength|.|They|will|soar|on|wings|like|eagles|;|they|will|run|and|not|grow|weary|,|they|will|walk|and|not|be|faint|.

It started a few months ago, I woke up one morning with double vision. After a few hours the double vision would go away and I would be dizzy, off balance, nauseous, would have head aches, and extreme fatigue. This lasted for about a month, in that month I had gotten MRIs, they found two lesions on my brain and also gotten a spinal tap and did the evoked visual potential test. My symptoms have gone away, since experiencing symptoms I have quit smoking, started taking vitamins and tried to eat healthier. My neurologist wants me to start meds ASAP and I'm in the process of deciding on one. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	My|name|is|Sammy|,|I'm|27|years|old|and|was|recently|diagnosed|with|MS|(|or|at|this|point|Clinically|Isolated|Syndrome|)|.|It|started|a|few|months|ago|,|I|woke|up|one|morning|with|double|vision|.|After|a|few|hours|the|double|vision|would|go|away|and|I|would|be|dizzy|,|off|balance|,|nauseous|,|would|have|head|aches|,|and|extreme|fatigue|.|This|lasted|for|about|a|month|,|in|that|month|I|had|gotten|MRIs|,|they|found|two|lesions|on|my|brain|and|also|gotten|a|spinal|tap|and|did|the|evoked|visual|potential|test|.|My|symptoms|have|gone|away|,|since|experiencing|symptoms|I|have|quit|smoking|,|started|taking|vitamins|and|tried|to|eat|healthier|.|My|neurologist|wants|me|to|start|meds|ASAP|and|I'm|in|the|process|of|deciding|on|one|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694670553262051987/Activity-Feed-:-MS-Connection	Activity Feed : MS Connection	"MS probably began affecting my life right after high school, when I first began to lose my balance on little things. I was a little over weight, so my mind probably assumed it to that. I knew what I wanted to do, and I figured that by enlisting with the Air Force, my balance would improve while I lost weight. But a few years went by, and before I knew it, I was only a few pounds shy now for enlisting. This would be around may 2012 when I decided to get a membership to a gym as well as using the insanity workout. BIG mistake. I finished one month of insanity before I decided to just go to the gym. Another couple of weeks passed by when I had my first major fall. Everyone here knows what fall I'm talking about: the one where you're doing something, and for one reason or another, you're on the floor. Nothing hurt, so I checked out both of my ankles, as well as the muscles in my legs before I let my body rest for a few days. It didn't get better, but being a guy also brings bring prideful. I shrugged off my slowly worsening limp as being just a workout injury, telling my family, friends, and coworkers that it would heal if I just rested up. But my mother wouldn't have that. She noticed that I would walk next to the walls, park as close as I could to wherever I was going, and she even noticed when I would pause before walking over a curb. Needless to say a tour of doctors soon followed. The family doctor was first, followed by an orthopedist, then a sports doctor specializing in foot injuries, but they didn't have the right answer. I received a sports brace, which helped, but now I was dragging my foot on the floor. We finally went to see a neurologist. He tested my nerves, sent me for a spinal tap, and finally the MRI. My mom, being as she is, was looking all over the Internet for the answer. I remember what she said. ""You might have multiple scoliosis, "" and I almost laughed. I wanted to tell her that I passed that test in school, but my mind knew better. I knew she meant multiple sclerosis, and I knew she was right. We received the news December 4th, and I knew that I would not be able to join any branch. It was a hollow Christmas for me, but my mind was working out its new plan. I loved writing, and my hand rekindled its relationship with the pen. I decided that if I couldn't enlist, I would write books, and eventually, after they get published, I want to show the world that when one door closes, another one has opened; you just have to find it. Eventually, I would love to create an organization that helps people with MS achieve their dreams, no matter how big or small. I joined this community because my mind and my heart still don't agree that I have MS, and the people that I know don't really understand what it is like. I don't want sympathy/empathy/pity, I want understanding. They try, but having MS is like coming back from war; you can't understand it if you haven't experienced it.

From there I went to see an optimologist who said the same thing and brought up the idea of possibly having MS. She ordered that I have a brain MRI as well as blood work done.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692591211611609763/Symptoms-getting-worse-still-havent-seen-Dr--please-help!-ms---Multiple-Sclerosis---MedHelp	Symptoms getting worse still haven’t seen Dr- please help! ms - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp	Symptoms getting worse still haven’t seen Dr- please help! ms - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp. Thanks for responding, :( I am trying so hard to relax my bf is trying to help too. i was doing great then my heel tingle is getting worse, it keeps coming and going. its not numb. and my muscles are sore in random spots. im praying its just from my chemo but the whole thing is just bothering/depressing me. trying to breath! You can and you must find your calm, keep trying!! Fight your anxiety because it's making you think the worst without a good enough reason, your headspace is spinning and bringing you down, depression and or anxiety will make any one feel a million times worse....call a therapist, call a help line, call a friend, call anyone you know who will distract you and. help you find a calmer headspace! Keep breathing..... I’ve calmed down a bit :( Finally went to my appointment - He is sending me for bloodwork for my thyroid, b12, calcium magnesium ect. He said 99 percent of the time these things are anxiety, then also tested my strength and asked about vision and balance issues ect. He didn’t have much to say about MS only that there is a lot of other things to look for first. IF my levels come back normal idk what would be next. When a mental health causation like 'anxiety' is high on your potential causes list, it's typical to get a mental health assessment so a M/H causation can be ruled out (or in) just like any other potential medical condition as part of the diagnostic process. It's in anyone's best interest to get a mental health assessment if or when a neuro is already mentioning mental health causation at the first appointment... Keep in mind that with your mental health and cancer history what your dealing with is very unlikely to do with a neurological condition like MS, general blood tests will rule out or in most obvious causes and if they're all normal, your neuro may consider running more specific neurological related tests eg brain and spinal MRI's, various nerve conductor tests etc. In general it's estimated that only around a third of neuro consults turn out to be neurological related, a third mental health related and a third are all the other medical conditions that also mimic neurological symptoms.... your neuro is likely telling you that what you have described experiencing is 99% of the time mental health related. Thank you :) Well he’s actually an internist i haven’t yet seen a nuero. I’m just finding it so hard to believe that twitching ect is anxiety but I guess the more i think about it it is believable. My bloodwork was all in range besides a slightly elevated thyroid. He doesnt seem concerned but is having me back on the 17th. I also found a new therapist so we’ll see how that goes. I’m just not sure what to do about more testing, if i should drop it, i feel like i am so worried about MS its consuming me not having answers. It may be harder for you to believe and accept anxiety can and does cause physically symptoms simply because that is exactly what happen's with the health anxiety types of mental health issues... I would highly recommend you take a proactive step back and focus on what you absolutely know to be true before you consider getting any unrelated tests done.... you have a history of struggling with health anxiety which you acknowledge started before and has continued after your cancer battle, so regardless of anything else it is definitely in your current (and future) best interest to focus your attention on understand and pursuing mental health support and treatment options because in this moment in time your health anxiety is seriously effecting your life! Focus on getting your mental health situation under control before anything else because only then will you be able to make clear and informed choices and not choices driven by your health anxiety...... 	1	1	Symptoms|getting|worse|still|haven|’|t|seen|Dr|-|please|help|!|ms|-|Multiple|Sclerosis|-|MedHelp	Symptoms|getting|worse|still|haven|’|t|seen|Dr|-|please|help|!|ms|-|Multiple|Sclerosis|-|MedHelp|.|Thanks|for|responding|,|:(|I|am|trying|so|hard|to|relax|my|bf|is|trying|to|help|too|.|i|was|doing|great|then|my|heel|tingle|is|getting|worse|,|it|keeps|coming|and|going|.|its|not|numb|.|and|my|muscles|are|sore|in|random|spots|.|im|praying|its|just|from|my|chemo|but|the|whole|thing|is|just|bothering|/|depressing|me|.|trying|to|breath|!|You|can|and|you|must|find|your|calm|,|keep|trying|!|!|Fight|your|anxiety|because|it's|making|you|think|the|worst|without|a|good|enough|reason|,|your|headspace|is|spinning|and|bringing|you|down|,|depression|and|or|anxiety|will|make|any|one|feel|a|million|times|worse|...|call|a|therapist|,|call|a|help|line|,|call|a|friend|,|call|anyone|you|know|who|will|distract|you|and|.|help|you|find|a|calmer|headspace|!|Keep|breathing|...|I|’|ve|calmed|down|a|bit|:(|Finally|went|to|my|appointment|-|He|is|sending|me|for|bloodwork|for|my|thyroid|,|b12|,|calcium|magnesium|ect|.|He|said|99|percent|of|the|time|these|things|are|anxiety|,|then|also|tested|my|strength|and|asked|about|vision|and|balance|issues|ect|.|He|didn|’|t|have|much|to|say|about|MS|only|that|there|is|a|lot|of|other|things|to|look|for|first|.|IF|my|levels|come|back|normal|idk|what|would|be|next|.|When|a|mental|health|causation|like|'|anxiety|'|is|high|on|your|potential|causes|list|,|it's|typical|to|get|a|mental|health|assessment|so|a|M|/|H|causation|can|be|ruled|out|(|or|in|)|just|like|any|other|potential|medical|condition|as|part|of|the|diagnostic|process|.|It's|in|anyone's|best|interest|to|get|a|mental|health|assessment|if|or|when|a|neuro|is|already|mentioning|mental|health|causation|at|the|first|appointment|...|Keep|in|mind|that|with|your|mental|health|and|cancer|history|what|your|dealing|with|is|very|unlikely|to|do|with|a|neurological|condition|like|MS|,|general|blood|tests|will|rule|out|or|in|most|obvious|causes|and|if|they're|all|normal|,|your|neuro|may|consider|running|more|specific|neurological|related|tests|eg|brain|and|spinal|MRI's|,|various|nerve|conductor|tests|etc|.|In|general|it's|estimated|that|only|around|a|third|of|neuro|consults|turn|out|to|be|neurological|related|,|a|third|mental|health|related|and|a|third|are|all|the|other|medical|conditions|that|also|mimic|neurological|symptoms|...|your|neuro|is|likely|telling|you|that|what|you|have|described|experiencing|is|99|%|of|the|time|mental|health|related|.|Thank|you|:)|Well|he|’|s|actually|an|internist|i|haven|’|t|yet|seen|a|nuero|.|I|’|m|just|finding|it|so|hard|to|believe|that|twitching|ect|is|anxiety|but|I|guess|the|more|i|think|about|it|it|is|believable|.|My|bloodwork|was|all|in|range|besides|a|slightly|elevated|thyroid|.|He|doesnt|seem|concerned|but|is|having|me|back|on|the|17th|.|I|also|found|a|new|therapist|so|we|’|ll|see|how|that|goes|.|I|’|m|just|not|sure|what|to|do|about|more|testing|,|if|i|should|drop|it|,|i|feel|like|i|am|so|worried|about|MS|its|consuming|me|not|having|answers|.|It|may|be|harder|for|you|to|believe|and|accept|anxiety|can|and|does|cause|physically|symptoms|simply|because|that|is|exactly|what|happen's|with|the|health|anxiety|types|of|mental|health|issues|...|I|would|highly|recommend|you|take|a|proactive|step|back|and|focus|on|what|you|absolutely|know|to|be|true|before|you|consider|getting|any|unrelated|tests|done|...|you|have|a|history|of|struggling|with|health|anxiety|which|you|acknowledge|started|before|and|has|continued|after|your|cancer|battle|,|so|regardless|of|anything|else|it|is|definitely|in|your|current|(|and|future|)|best|interest|to|focus|your|attention|on|understand|and|pursuing|mental|health|support|and|treatment|options|because|in|this|moment|in|time|your|health|anxiety|is|seriously|effecting|your|life|!|Focus|on|getting|your|mental|health|situation|under|control|before|anything|else|because|only|then|will|you|be|able|to|make|clear|and|informed|choices|and|not|choices|driven|by|your|health|anxiety|...

Chronic fatigue... Sore and painful or tender joints, particularly knee, hips, wrist, hands, thumbs and first two fingers on hands... Brain fog, memory loss, confusion... Muscle aches, body pain, that can come and go... Headaches, sometimes severe, sometimes daily, some that don`t respond to medication... Abdominal pain, on right side, under rib cage, or lower in abdomen, abdominal distention and fluid retention... IBS, colitis... Feel cold, chilled, trembles, weakness... Heart palpitations, flutters, breathlessness, see stars... Sweats, hot flashes... Low libido, loss of sex drive, hypogonadism, irregular periods, or cessation (stopping periods), or early menopause... Skin problems, dry skin, rashes that come and go, psoriasis, rosacea, fingernail or toe ridges vertically or horizontally... Anemia, iron deficiency... Prostate problems... Nausea, vomiting, fevers that come and go... Abnormal and elevated liver enzymes that stay elevated for no reason that can be attributed to other disease, alcohol, or hepatitis... Vision problems, watery itchy eyes, floaters, blurry, vision loss, progressive or intermittant... Pancreas problems, gallstones, kidney stones, bile duct disease, gallbladder removal due to inflammation or disease... Hypothyroidism, or thyroid symptoms or issues... Neurological problems, arthropathy, personality changes, irritability, depression, anger issues, mood swings... Enlarged heart, spleen, liver, pancreas... Lesions or nodules on pancreas, liver... Polyps on colon, or colon cancer... Been told you may have fibromyalgia, MS, Lupus, or Lyme disease... but dr.s can`t quite pinpoint the cause of your symptoms or tests for these show negative... You need to consider the common and genetic disorder called Hereditary Hemochromatosis... otherwise known as Iron Overload. Iron is a toxic metal that builds to excess in the bodies of people who for genetic reasons load iron from birth instead of getting rid of excess iron. This creates iron toxicity, which in turn, does damage to multiple organs, tissues and joints. Even small amounts in excess of what our bodies needs causes damage and is not optimal for overall good health, leading to a host of other diseases, immune system compromise, free radicals that encourage cancer growth and leave you vulnerable to fighting off viruses such as Hepatitis. Early detection is key, and doctors are missing the important early warning signs, INSTEAD, looking for what they have been taught in medical training to look for, the three CLASSIC symptoms which are END STAGE... cirrhosis, diabetes related to liver cirrhosis, and bronze skin (ever tan). Latest research has shown that these three classic symptoms are by then too late, and patient has irreversible organ and tissue damage and joint degenerationby this point of diagnosis that cannot be resolved. IF, HOWEVER, the iron overload symptoms are detected early, many of the disease manifestations and subsequent problems can be avoided, with normal life expectancy. The longer left undetected, and thus untreated, the more compromised a person`s body, immune system and body functions become, leading to shorter life expectancy and death. Liver cirrhosis, diabetes, cancers, and arthritis can be PREVENTED if iron overload is detected in the early stages. Who are affected... This is usually a genetic mutation found predominantly in people of European descent, Irish and Scottish seems to be affected the most, but French, and UK and Australia have high prevelance. In Ireland, the number is 1in 3 or 4 are carriers of one or two mutations of the HFE gene, and will develop symptoms. Some with the mutation can also be healthy carriers, never becoming symptomatic, but pass it on to their children, or their sibling may develop symptoms, while others won`t. Main thing is, if someone suspects they may have iron overload, they need to get checked, it is a simple blood test, and if diagnosed then all first-degree relatives need to be tested. This can help all family members with early detection. Women are affected as much as men, however men show signs sooner, and are diagnosed sooner than women due to the fact that women menstruate and give birth, and so natural blood loss every month results in less iron accumulation than men. So men are diagnosed usually in their 40`s and 50`s and women 10-15 years later, usually after menopause. But men and women who iron load will begin to exhibit early warnings signs, sometimes in teens and early 20`s, doctors just don`t attribute it to iron overload, but often diagnose the often unspecific symptoms as something else, or in the presence of `normal`` blood panels and routine blood work they prescribe either pain killers for the symptomatic pain or anti-depressants for the symptoms they attribute to depression or other neurological issues. Parkinson`s, Alzheimers, MS, cancers, all have links to iron overload, and new studies can show the link to these common disorders and conditions. Dr. Zamboni has been a recent pioneer into the MS and iron link, curing his wife and many others of MS by restoring normal blood flow to and from brain and removing iron that was stored and blocked in the brain by vein blockages. Once the iron is cleared out of brain, and healthy levels restored, the MS and symptoms have disappeared, even the brain lesions. It is exciting and breakthrough findings like this that have given MS sufferers a ray of hope that they no longer have to have a life long sentence of suffering and progressive debilitation. Some organs that iron loads onto causing co-disease... pituitary gland, thyroid, pancreas, liver, heart, brain... Some tissues affected are intestines, soft connective tissues, muscles... Some joints affected are hips, knees, wrists, hands, and thumb and first two fingers on hand in particular. Some common cause of death related to damage from iron overload... Congestive heart failure. Colon cancer...among many more. What tests do you need... You need to ask for screening for iron overload, which includes serum ferritin, transferrin saturation %, TIBC or UIBC, and serum iron. Also it is a good idea to get your liver enzymes checked, as this will determine if there is liver damage present. Elevated liver enzymes are a red flag for physicians to check further into root causes, iron overload being one. I can help with questions, I can help direct where to research and how to consult with your doctor. I hope this forum will help someone with their unanswered questions and lead to information... with information and sharing we can get to the bottom of this common and rarely diagnosed genetic disorder. Good health wishes to all, and I am here any time to answer any questions, and what I don`t know I can suggest research, and I am not a dr. just someone who has investigated this disorder because of love for my husband who was recently diagnosed and because of his diagnosis I found my own iron overload at the early stage.

I had another neuro say it wasn’t ALS; had a doctor do an EMG two months ago and my twitches and EMG were “normal” with no neuropathy/denervation,. Had an MRI in maybe April/May and no lesions; ER doctor said MS unlikely; scan was unremarkable. Had biopsy on skin for small fiber neuropathy—nada. Bloodwork: low d3; positive ANA (which is like for autoimmune type stuff but rheumatologist said no). So I’m kind of stuck. And I’m not sure what I can do right now. 	1	1	Did|anyone|symptoms|start|with|muscle|tensing|in|the|limbs|at|rest|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692591630682823467/havent-been-here-in-awhile-rant---SURVIVING-NEUROLOGICAL-LIMBO-LAND---NO-DX---MedHelp	havent been here in awhile rant - SURVIVING NEUROLOGICAL LIMBO LAND - NO DX - MedHelp	Hey chefaid90! It's been a while since someone posted here. I feel bad for you, but you know, I have a couple ideas t. What if your suspicion for ms is taking you the wrong direction? I will give you 5 different possibilities, each of them consistent with many of your symptoms- to a degree- as causative factors or co-factors. 1. Ovarian-Hypothalamic-Thyroid Axis imbalance. 2. Adrenal fatigue stage 2 or stage 3. 3. Hypothyroidism (likely secondary). 4. Pathogenic Mycoplasma infection and /or co-infection. 5. Lymes disease/ Neuroborreliosis. All of the above are very difficult to diagnose and treat through conventional doctors with the exception perhaps in some simple cases of hypothyroidism and early stage lyme disease. If you want to consider doing some research for these, I wouldn't mind to. offer you some guidance, should you find that some of these possibilities. resonate with you. Sorry, things haven't improved for you, but hang in there and please keep in touch. By the way, I have lost touch with Maria, the founder of this group. Have you had any exchange with her on the forum, perhaps at the ms community? I have looked up all those you listed. None of them even come close to what my symptoms are as they have way more symptoms that I dont even have. I have been tested multiple times using different types of test for thyroid problems and have had every lyme disease test ran that you can possible think of having ran. the only one i really cant find anything on is the first one. I will say that I dont live a stressful life at all. I am easy going and roll with the flow. I get worked up here and there but that is usually only dealing with these doctors. I have not been in touch with Maria. I had given up hope for awhile with this formn as it doesnt seem like anyone posts in it anymore. My bowel problems they believe are either coming from celiacs or IBS I have an appt in may to be seen about that. You don't need to wait for your appt. Just do a gluten-free diet challenge for a few weeks. You will know if you experience improvement, but just be aware that the effects of gluten can linger around for many months, after you eliminate gluten from your diet. Many items, like shampoo, play-doe, salad dressings. sauces, soups etc. contain gluten. Just look up online the list. It's long! Many conditions may present just a few of the symptoms. with one person, while others may suffer a wider spectrum of symptoms from the same disease, as each person's constitution is different and it also depends on their genotype and phenotype. For any type of hypothyroid, whether secondary or sub-clinical, the compromised cellular energy may affect any part of a persons body, even with all the standard serum tests returning negative for hypothyroid. In adrenal fatigue, the one thing to watch out for is hidden stress, something that we may not aware of at all, as it is not necessarily. a conscious process. For mycoplasma infections and co-infections which can target any part of your body with just a few symptoms or cause severe illness where one can become bedridden, you may want to search Dr. Garth Nicolson here at medhelp. He's a regular contributor and the top expert in this field. Most doctors don't have a clue about pathogenic mycoplasma and most tests cannot detect them. The OAT axis imbalance would be a stronger possibility if you had ovarian. hormonal and gynecological issues in the past in addition to ongoing fatigue and weakness. It may be somewhat linked also to low adrenal function. To really test accurately for this, only a holistic endocrinologist can help you with that, since conventional endos don't recognize such imbalances,. until they become crisis! Best of luck and I hope you find some answer soon. 	1	1	havent|been|here|in|awhile|rant|-|SURVIVING|NEUROLOGICAL|LIMBO|LAND|-|NO|DX|-|MedHelp	Hey|chefaid|90|!|It's|been|a|while|since|someone|posted|here|.|I|feel|bad|for|you|,|but|you|know|,|I|have|a|couple|ideas|t|.|What|if|your|suspicion|for|ms|is|taking|you|the|wrong|direction|?|I|will|give|you|5|different|possibilities|,|each|of|them|consistent|with|many|of|your|symptoms|-|to|a|degree|-|as|causative|factors|or|co-factors|.|1|.|Ovarian-Hypothalamic-Thyroid|Axis|imbalance|.|2|.|Adrenal|fatigue|stage|2|or|stage|3|.|3|.|Hypothyroidism|(|likely|secondary|)|.|4|.|Pathogenic|Mycoplasma|infection|and|/|or|co-infection|.|5|.|Lymes|disease|/|Neuroborreliosis|.|All|of|the|above|are|very|difficult|to|diagnose|and|treat|through|conventional|doctors|with|the|exception|perhaps|in|some|simple|cases|of|hypothyroidism|and|early|stage|lyme|disease|.|If|you|want|to|consider|doing|some|research|for|these|,|I|wouldn't|mind|to|.|offer|you|some|guidance|,|should|you|find|that|some|of|these|possibilities|.|resonate|with|you|.|Sorry|,|things|haven't|improved|for|you|,|but|hang|in|there|and|please|keep|in|touch|.|By|the|way|,|I|have|lost|touch|with|Maria|,|the|founder|of|this|group|.|Have|you|had|any|exchange|with|her|on|the|forum|,|perhaps|at|the|ms|community|?|I|have|looked|up|all|those|you|listed|.|None|of|them|even|come|close|to|what|my|symptoms|are|as|they|have|way|more|symptoms|that|I|dont|even|have|.|I|have|been|tested|multiple|times|using|different|types|of|test|for|thyroid|problems|and|have|had|every|lyme|disease|test|ran|that|you|can|possible|think|of|having|ran|.|the|only|one|i|really|cant|find|anything|on|is|the|first|one|.|I|will|say|that|I|dont|live|a|stressful|life|at|all|.|I|am|easy|going|and|roll|with|the|flow|.|I|get|worked|up|here|and|there|but|that|is|usually|only|dealing|with|these|doctors|.|I|have|not|been|in|touch|with|Maria|.|I|had|given|up|hope|for|awhile|with|this|formn|as|it|doesnt|seem|like|anyone|posts|in|it|anymore|.|My|bowel|problems|they|believe|are|either|coming|from|celiacs|or|IBS|I|have|an|appt|in|may|to|be|seen|about|that|.|You|don't|need|to|wait|for|your|appt|.|Just|do|a|gluten-free|diet|challenge|for|a|few|weeks|.|You|will|know|if|you|experience|improvement|,|but|just|be|aware|that|the|effects|of|gluten|can|linger|around|for|many|months|,|after|you|eliminate|gluten|from|your|diet|.|Many|items|,|like|shampoo|,|play-doe|,|salad|dressings|.|sauces|,|soups|etc|.|contain|gluten|.|Just|look|up|online|the|list|.|It's|long|!|Many|conditions|may|present|just|a|few|of|the|symptoms|.|with|one|person|,|while|others|may|suffer|a|wider|spectrum|of|symptoms|from|the|same|disease|,|as|each|person's|constitution|is|different|and|it|also|depends|on|their|genotype|and|phenotype|.|For|any|type|of|hypothyroid|,|whether|secondary|or|sub-clinical|,|the|compromised|cellular|energy|may|affect|any|part|of|a|persons|body|,|even|with|all|the|standard|serum|tests|returning|negative|for|hypothyroid|.|In|adrenal|fatigue|,|the|one|thing|to|watch|out|for|is|hidden|stress|,|something|that|we|may|not|aware|of|at|all|,|as|it|is|not|necessarily|.|a|conscious|process|.|For|mycoplasma|infections|and|co-infections|which|can|target|any|part|of|your|body|with|just|a|few|symptoms|or|cause|severe|illness|where|one|can|become|bedridden|,|you|may|want|to|search|Dr|.|Garth|Nicolson|here|at|medhelp|.|He's|a|regular|contributor|and|the|top|expert|in|this|field|.|Most|doctors|don't|have|a|clue|about|pathogenic|mycoplasma|and|most|tests|cannot|detect|them|.|The|OAT|axis|imbalance|would|be|a|stronger|possibility|if|you|had|ovarian|.|hormonal|and|gynecological|issues|in|the|past|in|addition|to|ongoing|fatigue|and|weakness|.|It|may|be|somewhat|linked|also|to|low|adrenal|function|.|To|really|test|accurately|for|this|,|only|a|holistic|endocrinologist|can|help|you|with|that|,|since|conventional|endos|don't|recognize|such|imbalances|,|.|until|they|become|crisis|!|Best|of|luck|and|I|hope|you|find|some|answer|soon|.

They're just booked out so far that I'd like to maybe get into a General Neuro so i can get there opinion and maybe rule out other conditions like MS or something else. I can't imagine living this way much longer, it's just not a good quality of life. Even though I don't have a certain diagnosis, emotionally it's like I've already been diagnosed. 	1	1	Lost|waiting|for|a|diagnosis	Yes|,|my|appointment|is|at|the|University|of|Utah|,|so|it's|a|good|clinic|.|They're|just|booked|out|so|far|that|I'd|like|to|maybe|get|into|a|General|Neuro|so|i|can|get|there|opinion|and|maybe|rule|out|other|conditions|like|MS|or|something|else|.|I|can't|imagine|living|this|way|much|longer|,|it's|just|not|a|good|quality|of|life|.|Even|though|I|don't|have|a|certain|diagnosis|,|emotionally|it's|like|I've|already|been|diagnosed|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715561955063235766/Did-anyone-symptoms-start-with-muscle-tensing-in-the-limbs-at-rest?	Did anyone symptoms start with muscle tensing in the limbs at rest?	Zero, you are honestly more hypochondriac than I. I mean I get you, I know what it's like when medical doctors give you late/wrong diagnosis for years, then you get paranoid about anything that can go wrong. It kind of shattered my psyche when all my health issues started because I realized how fragile it all is and how little we know in science in regards to neuro stuff. But lets look at the facts: You're on multiple neuroleptic meds and your symptoms are relatively minor. People can randomly develop neuro stuff alone. Ataxia, dystonia, akathisia, so on and so forth. Many of the above are also part of an umbrella of symptoms for stuff like PD and ALS or MS. But you don't showcase any of the classic signs if either. Go to the ALS message board and ask. Your tremors don't resemble PDs at all. And ALS starts with muscle weakness, like you can't pick up a pitcher of water, you drop your glass of water type muscle weakness. All the symptoms you are displaying are also symptoms that can be caused both by and from tolerance/interdose withdrawals of benzos/ADs. Further there's literally no concrete tests for diagnosis most all this stuff. So doctors will go off the symptoms most of the time, and you don't showcase them enough. Is it possible you are in the very early stages of PD where it's not advanced enough to showcase the classic signs? But there's literally 1) no way to tell until such a time and 2) nothing you can do about it regardless. So I would suggest you stop fixating and being obsessive compulsive because no answer is going to be satisfactory to you. Just take care of your health, increase your D by sun exposure or supplements. Do at least some light exercise everyday, and avoid a lot of sugar. These things are helpful for everyone, and especially so for people with things like PD, so just cover your bases. maybe try to get off your meds, and be content to know that's all you can do right now, and that's all you can know right now. I've accepted my muscle tensions at some form of dystonia/extreme RLS for now, because there's literally nothing I can do about it except takes meds which I don't want to. I've gotten my remeron usage almost gone, and after an initial stage of super anxiety and paranoia, I feel better about it. My sleep is still shit, but some nights are increasing towards tolerable. You can just take it one day at a time, but obsessing and fixating to your level isn't going to help you better, nor is knowing. Also the fact that you said some stuff come and went, makes me think even more it's the meds. I had the same thing with benzos and remeron. Coming off benzos I hate all kinds of crazy shit, neuro, stomach, sleep, etc. Remeron was different but also bad. 	1	1	Did|anyone|symptoms|start|with|muscle|tensing|in|the|limbs|at|rest|?

I throw myself pity parties once in awhile, then I pick myself up, dust myself off and I'm ready for mischief. Life sucks MS, really. Find your time machine, let me borrow it so I can mess with history, the fun I could have. I have discovered, well this morning just how pissed off I am at PD, at first I thought it was sadness, but discovered it's more being angry at something that I can get ahold of. We women like to nurture, so we take care of illnesses and make our loved ones feel better, but this we can't fix, there in is my problem. So something good to say about life? I can think of a lot, so here goes. After a rain have you ever noticed how the whole landscape has been washed clean, how fresh the air smells? The smell of a rose early in the morning, or Nots puppy dog and the love you get in return. Or a double complete rainbow, with all the colors. Or a walk in the rain? How's that for good thoughts....... thanks again everyone, I live to survive another day. Maybe next time I throw a pity party I'll invite everyone. Hugs and prayers to all caregivers and our pwp's.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715562012339886836/non-traditional-treatments	non-traditional treatments	Two relatives and a colleague we know well all had dbs with absolutely amazing results. You must have a good response to sinemet and not be totally loony to be considered. (There are other criteria but these are critical). There is more than one part of the brain that can be stimulated and not all are associated with cognitive problems. The reason most go with dbs is due to to excessive motor fluctuations and an inability to get the meds to keep you functional all the time or severe side effects like dystonia. yes you have to take some meds after you have dbs but as far as satisfaction with dbs is concerned 95% of UF dbs patients indicated that the surgery resulted in an improvement. The others had some sort of post operative problem I believe. Regarding meds - it's pretty irresponsible to say those without meds are doing better than those with meds. Where are the studies showing this??? My DX was 10 years ago. I take sinemet and a lot of vitamins, calcium and magnesium and coQ. I shake perhaps 30 minutes a day max. I crash quite a bit because I''m trying to gain weight so I eat what I want usually other than avoiding high glycemic index foods and I eat when I'm hungry so my meds don't always get to my brain. Without meds I can barely walk. With meds I can do a shopping trip with my SO to Walmart and walk the entire time. sinemet has been amazing and given me back my life. What it doesn't give me is predictability in my life due to the crashes. I MUCH prefer the periodic crashes and my feet moving a bit from the sinemet to moving around like the great stone man, freezing all the time, having huge problems eating and drinking, being unable to speak clearly or loudly, having constant bladder urgencies, major constipation that requires 16 milk of magnesia tablets and being totally immobilized by anxiety from the agonists or no meds at all. Sinemet is NOT addictive and in the last three years I have reduced my dosage, not increased it. It's not perfect but it's a lot better than anything else out there. But I'll be the first to say DON'T BLAME ALL YOUR HEALTH PROBLEMS ON PD and don't let your doctor do this either. And yes exercise and meditation and yoga and self hypnosis all help and it's critical to get your vitamin and mineral levels and many other things checked regularly and supplement where needed. The nutritional section on this forum is fantastic. if I had done so I could have prevented the horrible neuropathy that made me an invalid for three months. Why does PD progress? Because we all AGE. Every chronic type disease out there is progressive because we get decrepit as we get older. Cells die and new ones aren't formed quickly enough or well enough to replace the dead ones. BUT there are many things we can do to slow the progress of all these chronic aging diseases and there are PWP who have gone for a very long time with essentially no change. I spoke to a neurologist who had one such patient and the neurologist said he's quite convinced that the patient truly does have PD. so what do we do if we are diagnosed with arthritis? Do we buy a power chair and give up? No. We read and find things that reduce inflammation, we exercise, we take better care of our joints and we take supplements that have studies done that prove they help rebuild the damaged joints. Well we must treat PD the same way. We must exercise, take supplements known to help keep our brains running well, eat healthy food, get regular checkups and treat health problems as they arise and just take really good care of ourselves. It is well known that doing brain exercise keeps you smart. So we need to do this and we need physical therapy when we develop a deficit in how we move to strength our muscles and improve our balance. So yes there are many many things we can all do to slow aging and these things will also slow the progression of PD unless we have something going on like an autoimmune disorder in which case it must be treated with proven meds for this type of thing. If we have PD because like in my case, my dad used rotenone on our pond and stunned fish with it and we ate the fish and killed brain cells, we just have to take really good care of our brains and use them as much as possible, in a many different ways as possible and exercise in as many ways as possible and REDUCE STRESS!! STRESS IS THE WORST of all possible things for our health - so learn how to meditate. It does work. Good luck guys and let us all know what you do, how you do it and how well it works. 	0	0	non-traditional|treatments	Two|relatives|and|a|colleague|we|know|well|all|had|dbs|with|absolutely|amazing|results|.|You|must|have|a|good|response|to|sinemet|and|not|be|totally|loony|to|be|considered|.|(|There|are|other|criteria|but|these|are|critical|)|.|There|is|more|than|one|part|of|the|brain|that|can|be|stimulated|and|not|all|are|associated|with|cognitive|problems|.|The|reason|most|go|with|dbs|is|due|to|to|excessive|motor|fluctuations|and|an|inability|to|get|the|meds|to|keep|you|functional|all|the|time|or|severe|side|effects|like|dystonia|.|yes|you|have|to|take|some|meds|after|you|have|dbs|but|as|far|as|satisfaction|with|dbs|is|concerned|95|%|of|UF|dbs|patients|indicated|that|the|surgery|resulted|in|an|improvement|.|The|others|had|some|sort|of|post|operative|problem|I|believe|.|Regarding|meds|-|it's|pretty|irresponsible|to|say|those|without|meds|are|doing|better|than|those|with|meds|.|Where|are|the|studies|showing|this|?|?|?|My|DX|was|10|years|ago|.|I|take|sinemet|and|a|lot|of|vitamins|,|calcium|and|magnesium|and|coQ|.|I|shake|perhaps|30|minutes|a|day|max|.|I|crash|quite|a|bit|because|I''m|trying|to|gain|weight|so|I|eat|what|I|want|usually|other|than|avoiding|high|glycemic|index|foods|and|I|eat|when|I'm|hungry|so|my|meds|don't|always|get|to|my|brain|.|Without|meds|I|can|barely|walk|.|With|meds|I|can|do|a|shopping|trip|with|my|SO|to|Walmart|and|walk|the|entire|time|.|sinemet|has|been|amazing|and|given|me|back|my|life|.|What|it|doesn't|give|me|is|predictability|in|my|life|due|to|the|crashes|.|I|MUCH|prefer|the|periodic|crashes|and|my|feet|moving|a|bit|from|the|sinemet|to|moving|around|like|the|great|stone|man|,|freezing|all|the|time|,|having|huge|problems|eating|and|drinking|,|being|unable|to|speak|clearly|or|loudly|,|having|constant|bladder|urgencies|,|major|constipation|that|requires|16|milk|of|magnesia|tablets|and|being|totally|immobilized|by|anxiety|from|the|agonists|or|no|meds|at|all|.|Sinemet|is|NOT|addictive|and|in|the|last|three|years|I|have|reduced|my|dosage|,|not|increased|it|.|It's|not|perfect|but|it's|a|lot|better|than|anything|else|out|there|.|But|I'll|be|the|first|to|say|DON'T|BLAME|ALL|YOUR|HEALTH|PROBLEMS|ON|PD|and|don't|let|your|doctor|do|this|either|.|And|yes|exercise|and|meditation|and|yoga|and|self|hypnosis|all|help|and|it's|critical|to|get|your|vitamin|and|mineral|levels|and|many|other|things|checked|regularly|and|supplement|where|needed|.|The|nutritional|section|on|this|forum|is|fantastic|.|if|I|had|done|so|I|could|have|prevented|the|horrible|neuropathy|that|made|me|an|invalid|for|three|months|.|Why|does|PD|progress|?|Because|we|all|AGE|.|Every|chronic|type|disease|out|there|is|progressive|because|we|get|decrepit|as|we|get|older|.|Cells|die|and|new|ones|aren't|formed|quickly|enough|or|well|enough|to|replace|the|dead|ones|.|BUT|there|are|many|things|we|can|do|to|slow|the|progress|of|all|these|chronic|aging|diseases|and|there|are|PWP|who|have|gone|for|a|very|long|time|with|essentially|no|change|.|I|spoke|to|a|neurologist|who|had|one|such|patient|and|the|neurologist|said|he's|quite|convinced|that|the|patient|truly|does|have|PD|.|so|what|do|we|do|if|we|are|diagnosed|with|arthritis|?|Do|we|buy|a|power|chair|and|give|up|?|No|.|We|read|and|find|things|that|reduce|inflammation|,|we|exercise|,|we|take|better|care|of|our|joints|and|we|take|supplements|that|have|studies|done|that|prove|they|help|rebuild|the|damaged|joints|.|Well|we|must|treat|PD|the|same|way|.|We|must|exercise|,|take|supplements|known|to|help|keep|our|brains|running|well|,|eat|healthy|food|,|get|regular|checkups|and|treat|health|problems|as|they|arise|and|just|take|really|good|care|of|ourselves|.|It|is|well|known|that|doing|brain|exercise|keeps|you|smart|.|So|we|need|to|do|this|and|we|need|physical|therapy|when|we|develop|a|deficit|in|how|we|move|to|strength|our|muscles|and|improve|our|balance|.|So|yes|there|are|many|many|things|we|can|all|do|to|slow|aging|and|these|things|will|also|slow|the|progression|of|PD|unless|we|have|something|going|on|like|an|autoimmune|disorder|in|which|case|it|must|be|treated|with|proven|meds|for|this|type|of|thing|.|If|we|have|PD|because|like|in|my|case|,|my|dad|used|rotenone|on|our|pond|and|stunned|fish|with|it|and|we|ate|the|fish|and|killed|brain|cells|,|we|just|have|to|take|really|good|care|of|our|brains|and|use|them|as|much|as|possible|,|in|a|many|different|ways|as|possible|and|exercise|in|as|many|ways|as|possible|and|REDUCE|STRESS|!|!|STRESS|IS|THE|WORST|of|all|possible|things|for|our|health|-|so|learn|how|to|meditate|.|It|does|work|.|Good|luck|guys|and|let|us|all|know|what|you|do|,|how|you|do|it|and|how|well|it|works|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715562167157523166/medical-marijuana	medical marijuana	"National Pain Foundation. Alternative and Complementary. Marijuana and Pain Management. By: Bill McCarberg, M.D. Millions of people in the United States suffer from chronic pain, and much of that suffering cannot be relieved adequately by existing treatments. Patients are in desperate need of new pain management approaches. Cannabinoid medicines appear very promising, although the subject often is obscured by controversy, prejudice, and confusion in part because cannabinoids have some relation to the cannabis plant – also known by the slang term marijuana. What scientific reasons do doctors have to think that cannabinoids actually work? Do they provide genuine symptom improvement, or do patients become intoxicated and merely think that their symptoms are reduced? Basic research conducted over the past 20 years provides us with many answers. In the early 1990s, researchers identified the cannabinoid receptor system. This system is found in some of the most primitive animal forms on earth – it is also the most widespread receptor system in the human body. The cannabinoid receptor system has two types of receptors:. CB1 receptors are found primarily in the brain, spinal cord, and periphery. CB2 receptors are on the immune tissues. Specific molecules (called endocannabinoids) are produced by the body that interact with these CB1 and CB2 receptors, much like endorphins interact with the body's opioid receptor system. These findings initiated a new era of scientific interest and research in cannabinoids. Numerous studies have now established that cannabinoids help lessen pain and affect a wide range of symptoms and bodily functions. Such research has also demonstrated that cannabinoids may work together with opioids to enhance their effectiveness and reduce tolerance. This body of research has allowed cannabinoids to be informally classified into three types:. endocannabinoids (produced by the body). phytocannabinoids (produced by the cannabis plant). synthetic cannabinoids (produced in the laboratory). Each type is being studied aggressively, but because endocannabinoids are quickly metabolized and probably cannot be patented, they have not yet been researched in humans. What progress is being made toward developing cannabinoids as prescription pain relievers? Some cannabinoids are unstable and many are insoluble in water, which makes them difficult to research and turn into modern medicines. Patients react very differently to cannabinoids. Data from recent clinical trials are encouraging, but somewhat mixed. Looking closely at the results suggests that composition and delivery route (i.e., how a medicine is administered) are extremely important to the viability of cannabinoid medicines. The Delivery Route. When taken orally, cannabinoids are not very well absorbed and often have unpredictable effects. Patients often become sedated or have intoxication-like symptoms when tetrahydrocannabinol (THC – the primary psychoactive cannabinoid in cannabis) is metabolized by the liver. A small number of studies with Marinol (synthetic THC in sesame oil in a gelatin capsule) and Cesamet (synthetic THC analogue) have shown some effectiveness in pain relief, but optimal doses that relieve pain often cannot be achieved because of unpleasant psychologic side effects. Inhaling cannabinoids, especially THC, also may cause problems for many patients. Blood levels rise suddenly and then drop off sharply. This rapid on-off effect may produce significant intoxication, particularly in patients who are new to cannabinoids. This may pose the risk of abuse potential. Smoking cannabis produces this effect, which is the very reason that recreational users prefer the inhaled route. Patients, however, generally wish to avoid psychologic effects, and it is unclear how difficult it might be to find a dosing pattern that enables them to have pain control without side effects. A new product, called Sativex, was approved by Health Canada in June 2005 for marketing as an adjunctive medicine for central neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. Adjunctive therapy means taking two or more medications to help control pain. Sativex has a different delivery system – an oromucosal/sublingual spray absorbed by the lining of the mouth – that, according to the manufacturer, generally allows patients to gradually work up to a stable dose at which they obtain therapeutic pain relief without unwanted psychologic effects. In the United States, Sativex is being studied in large randomized trials in cancer pain that has not been adequately relieved by opioids. Three early and six pivotal controlled studies in the United Kingdom demonstrated positive results treating chronic pain of various origins including neurologic pain, various symptoms of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer pain. Initial results show improvement in pain for more than one year despite lack of effectiveness of the opioids. Common adverse effects of Savitex have included complaints of bad taste, stinging, dry mouth, dizziness, nausea or fatigue. Additional research also may uncover other ways of avoiding the problems associated with oral or inhaled delivery. Ajulemic acid, a synthetic cannabinoid, binds to both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, and has shown benefit in a small neuropathic pain trial. It may have reduced psychologic effects and is being studied for the treatment of interstitial cystitis. The Interplay of Cannabinoids. The use of herbal cannabis – usually smoked – has received considerable media attention since California and Arizona passed ""medical marijuana"" initiatives in 1996. Despite numerous anecdotal reports of effectiveness, very few controlled studies have been published in the pain area. Little is known about the number of patients who actually experience some degree of benefit or side effects. Furthermore, herbal cannabis is neither standardized nor monitored for quality. The cannabinoid content can vary a great deal, and cannabis sold at dispensaries may be contaminated with pesticides or mold. Dosing is uncertain, depending on the preparation or method of use. So-called ""vaporizers"" do not eliminate all the contaminants. Without clinical trial data and an assurance of product quality, physicians lack the information necessary to assist patients in making informed therapeutic decisions. Both the FDA and Institute of Medicine have stated that there is no future for herbal cannabis as a prescription medicine. Nevertheless, there may be some truth to the idea that there is pain relief potential in phytocannabinoids (plant-based cannabinoids) and that such potential may be affected by the interaction of THC with other botanical components, particularly with other cannabinoids. Modern strains of cannabis have been bred to maximize the THC at the expense of all other cannabinoids, most of which do not have psychologic effects. Some of those cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD), have been demonstrated to have important therapeutic value, particularly on pain and inflammation. The possibilities for cannabinoid medicines are very promising, and much exciting research is proceeding at a rapid pace. As new FDA-approved cannabinoid products become available, physicians and patients will have a solid scientific foundation from which to assess their appropriateness. Hopefully, robust scientific data will soon allow cannabinoids to take their place – along with opiates and other pain relievers – in the modern medical supply for treating chronic pain. Bill H.

Thank you for moderating them! A tad of background for readers (I am a patient of Dr Okun's so he is aware of this). I am 53 years old, diagnosed at age 44 (possibly able to link first symptom onset 15 years earlier. I have had DBS for 6 years now. In addition to PD, I suffer from CIDP, an autoimmune disease that attacks my peripheral nerves-- primarily my feet (where I have virtually no feeling, and absolutely no tendon reflexes) and lower legs. Now for the question: I had a bunch of close friends to the beach earlier this spring. As guys would do, we started playing catch with a football. I was horrified to find virtually all of my hand-eye coordination was gone! I would over-judge or under-judge how far a ball that was thrown to me was. Or, I would fade back like a QB to throw a ball, stumble all over the place, and hit the sand. I used to be a competitive Division 1 athlete in college (soccer), and have noted similar coordination problems when simply kicking a ball around with my nephew. Also, if I try to walk into the ocean and there is even a tiny undertow, I can't even stand! These things are disturbing to me. Dr. Okun, I would like to be able to do the simple things I used to be able to do, but apparently can't. Can you explain what's going on, and is there anything I can do about it? Is this likely a PD thing or a CIDP thing, or both (one compounding the other). I am otherwise active, and typically walk at least 1-2 miles a day.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692591171664381573/Burning-on-the-right-top-side-of-the-head---Multiple-Sclerosis---MedHelp	Burning on the right top side of the head - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp	Hi and welcome,. Your question has landed in the MS community but bleeding and swollen gums is very common and typically caused by bacteria not being removed by your oral hygiene routine or technique, often all that's needed are minor changes eg using an anti bacterial mouth wash, replacing your tooth brush every 3 months, changing to a soft bristle tooth brush, brushing more softly, altering your flossing routine, brushing in a circular motion, brush at about a 45 degree angle, eating a low-sugar balanced diet; drinking plenty of water etc. Woman can also experience this more from fluctuating hormones, hormonal changes can alter a woman’s response to oral bacteria and increase blood flow to the gums, causing bleeding during brushing and flossing. Mental health medications and other types of medications can also cause oral side effects so it's worth checking if any medications or over the counter medications could be involved. Another thing to consider is changing your toothpaste, many tooth pastes now have a whitening agent which you could be reacting too. The burning pain on the top right side of your head that worsen when you turn your head to look to the left, if it's not headache or migraine related, sounds like it 'might be' something like occipital neuralgia....basically there are two occipital nerves in the spine of your upper neck that runs up to your scalp, usually the nerve pain (shooting, electric, burning or tingling) will be on only one side of your head, and in most cases, neurologic exams will come back with no abnormalities. Occipital neuralgia is most commonly caused by pinched nerves in a person's neck, sometimes it's related to the muscles being temporarily too tight in a person's neck or chronic neck tension. Consider things like your postural behaviour from too much time holding your neck bent forward with your head tilted down whilst looking down at your computer, tablet, mobile, book, hobbies, game console etc stress and anxiety can also cause the muscles in your neck and shoulders to be too tense... generally warm compress, basic relaxing exercises, massage and behavioural changes during activities will resolve the issue but sometimes medications like a muscle relaxer and or tricyclic anti-depressants and physio are needed. I'd recommend you first consider if there are any behaviours your doing that could be irritating-pinching the occipital nevers in your neck, as well as consider your mental health situation may be part of the problem but IF there are no cause and affect aspect to why it's happening then you'd best see your GP and get it checked out. Hope it helps....... 	0	0	Burning|on|the|right|top|side|of|the|head|-|Multiple|Sclerosis|-|MedHelp	Hi|and|welcome|,|.|Your|question|has|landed|in|the|MS|community|but|bleeding|and|swollen|gums|is|very|common|and|typically|caused|by|bacteria|not|being|removed|by|your|oral|hygiene|routine|or|technique|,|often|all|that's|needed|are|minor|changes|eg|using|an|anti|bacterial|mouth|wash|,|replacing|your|tooth|brush|every|3|months|,|changing|to|a|soft|bristle|tooth|brush|,|brushing|more|softly|,|altering|your|flossing|routine|,|brushing|in|a|circular|motion|,|brush|at|about|a|45|degree|angle|,|eating|a|low-sugar|balanced|diet|;|drinking|plenty|of|water|etc|.|Woman|can|also|experience|this|more|from|fluctuating|hormones|,|hormonal|changes|can|alter|a|woman|’|s|response|to|oral|bacteria|and|increase|blood|flow|to|the|gums|,|causing|bleeding|during|brushing|and|flossing|.|Mental|health|medications|and|other|types|of|medications|can|also|cause|oral|side|effects|so|it's|worth|checking|if|any|medications|or|over|the|counter|medications|could|be|involved|.|Another|thing|to|consider|is|changing|your|toothpaste|,|many|tooth|pastes|now|have|a|whitening|agent|which|you|could|be|reacting|too|.|The|burning|pain|on|the|top|right|side|of|your|head|that|worsen|when|you|turn|your|head|to|look|to|the|left|,|if|it's|not|headache|or|migraine|related|,|sounds|like|it|'|might|be|'|something|like|occipital|neuralgia|...|basically|there|are|two|occipital|nerves|in|the|spine|of|your|upper|neck|that|runs|up|to|your|scalp|,|usually|the|nerve|pain|(|shooting|,|electric|,|burning|or|tingling|)|will|be|on|only|one|side|of|your|head|,|and|in|most|cases|,|neurologic|exams|will|come|back|with|no|abnormalities|.|Occipital|neuralgia|is|most|commonly|caused|by|pinched|nerves|in|a|person's|neck|,|sometimes|it's|related|to|the|muscles|being|temporarily|too|tight|in|a|person's|neck|or|chronic|neck|tension|.|Consider|things|like|your|postural|behaviour|from|too|much|time|holding|your|neck|bent|forward|with|your|head|tilted|down|whilst|looking|down|at|your|computer|,|tablet|,|mobile|,|book|,|hobbies|,|game|console|etc|stress|and|anxiety|can|also|cause|the|muscles|in|your|neck|and|shoulders|to|be|too|tense|...|generally|warm|compress|,|basic|relaxing|exercises|,|massage|and|behavioural|changes|during|activities|will|resolve|the|issue|but|sometimes|medications|like|a|muscle|relaxer|and|or|tricyclic|anti-depressants|and|physio|are|needed|.|I'd|recommend|you|first|consider|if|there|are|any|behaviours|your|doing|that|could|be|irritating-pinching|the|occipital|nevers|in|your|neck|,|as|well|as|consider|your|mental|health|situation|may|be|part|of|the|problem|but|IF|there|are|no|cause|and|affect|aspect|to|why|it's|happening|then|you'd|best|see|your|GP|and|get|it|checked|out|.|Hope|it|helps|...

I am only 35 years old married with 2 children a son of 13 and a daughter of 11. It has already started to affect their lives. the things that I should be able to do with them, I have a hard time weather it is because of fatige, depression or pain and I feel guilty because of it and dont know what to do about it. Also I am not able to be intimate with my wife most of the time because of ms I think she sometimes feels it is because of her wich it is not. I love my wife very much, and very much want to be close to her. what I would say to someone with ms, is that I understand when everybody else may not. I would do anything to create a world without MS but not sure what I could do. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	was|diagnosed|about|4|months|ago|but|it|is|thought|that|i|have|had|it|for|a|while|.|I|am|only|35|years|old|married|with|2|children|a|son|of|13|and|a|daughter|of|11|.|It|has|already|started|to|affect|their|lives|.|the|things|that|I|should|be|able|to|do|with|them|,|I|have|a|hard|time|weather|it|is|because|of|fatige|,|depression|or|pain|and|I|feel|guilty|because|of|it|and|dont|know|what|to|do|about|it|.|Also|I|am|not|able|to|be|intimate|with|my|wife|most|of|the|time|because|of|ms|I|think|she|sometimes|feels|it|is|because|of|her|wich|it|is|not|.|I|love|my|wife|very|much|,|and|very|much|want|to|be|close|to|her|.|what|I|would|say|to|someone|with|ms|,|is|that|I|understand|when|everybody|else|may|not|.|I|would|do|anything|to|create|a|world|without|MS|but|not|sure|what|I|could|do|.

I had been having numbness/tingling/tremor like feeling in my legs and spine. MRI confirmed that I had several lesions and one active inflammatory lesion. I started prednisone but that has not decreased my symptoms (just made me gain wait).

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693250022399137909/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	I am 26 years old a mother, married, and in school finishing up my RN. I have found out some recent symptoms turned to be relapse, and symptoms that started in 09 that were over looked as equilibrium issues look to be MS, Id get pregnant just after symptoms started and was said that pregnancy put the symptoms in remission and then like clockwork 3-6months after delivering they would reappear. I ve been to the er and dr several times with vertigo med or migraine meds thrown at me that didnt help. er dr did ct that came back within normal limits but said he couldn't do much testing further but was suspicious of MS, advised me to follow up with a neurologist. No insurance so just said its nothing and went about my life. July 2014 i delivered a baby as a gestational surrogate, feeling great and them bam i was hit by a semi truck. End of Oct I would wake up and go to sleep with my world spinning around me, blinding migraines. In the beginning of Nov Weakness, tingling in my left arm hand and leg, fatigue, balance issues. slurred speech and hard getting words out slowly progressed over a week. Visiting the ER was not to much help. test came back normal, neuro said see a neuro specialized in MS get more MRIs done at a better facility suggest spinal tap and few other test since my MRIs arent showing enhanced lesions. He said hes had many patients who have MS that lesions didnt show for many years even after many years of symptoms it all depends on the type of MS etc. So here I am trying to learn how to handle my new body and mind I am living in. Trying to find a way to pay for my medical test and dr visit to see a neurologist at USF. I am normally a very happy overly active busy person. I am detailed organized and clean freak. I can hardly drive 90% of the time, Im constantly walking into walls fall, my mind is spacey out of it confused feeling, exhausted weak my hand is stiff, my legs get tingly, new muscle spasms randomly are showing up on my face and body. I feel like so fragile its not a good feeling, when Ive always been so independent and strong minded/willed, to be this fragile weak incoherent person. My husband doesnt full graps this disease, I try my hardest to not let him see how i am really feeling some days. I feel like a foreign citizen and no one around me speaks the same language as me. I can say that I have gained a new perspective and learned to let the little things that would normally send me into a full blown panic attack go, because the stress is not needed and no good for my healthy. I am learning to enjoy my children more. things can change in a flash before your eyes. Things that were simple task that i could do wiht my eyes closed or sleeping have turned to be hard to get through. I am trying to learn as much as I can about MS, finding a good support system.

The next morning I woke up and my whole body was numb. I had never experienced that before and so I assumed that maybe I had slept in a bad position, a day later the numbness had gotten worse and I began to lose coordination of my limbs. I was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder that destroying the myelin sheath of some sections of the nerves around the neck and right part of the brain . I was put on a steroid to help control the autoimmune response .Am at home now under going physiotherapy and hv made so improvement as I can walk though I still can't coordinate my hands which are also weak .Am hoping and praying for a complete recovery . 	0	0	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	About|four|weeks|ago|I|woke|up|with|some|neck|pains|,|I|did|think|much|about|it|so|i|assumed|the|pain|would|go|.|The|next|morning|I|woke|up|and|my|whole|body|was|numb|.|I|had|never|experienced|that|before|and|so|I|assumed|that|maybe|I|had|slept|in|a|bad|position|,|a|day|later|the|numbness|had|gotten|worse|and|I|began|to|lose|coordination|of|my|limbs|.|I|was|taken|to|the|hospital|and|diagnosed|with|an|autoimmune|disorder|that|destroying|the|myelin|sheath|of|some|sections|of|the|nerves|around|the|neck|and|right|part|of|the|brain|.|I|was|put|on|a|steroid|to|help|control|the|autoimmune|response|.|Am|at|home|now|under|going|physiotherapy|and|hv|made|so|improvement|as|I|can|walk|though|I|still|can't|coordinate|my|hands|which|are|also|weak|.|Am|hoping|and|praying|for|a|complete|recovery|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715573477081044860/Stuff-could-always-be-worse	Stuff could always be worse	I share a guest post from Chipper at Healthline.com. This seems hopeful to me when more medications are in the pipeline for MS..... You decide for yourself..... Pharmaceutical company, Merck KGaA, has acquired exclusive worldwide rights to PI-2301, which is an experimental drug for multiple sclerosis. The drug has already completed Phase II clinical trials. The PI-2301 was previously owned by Peptimmune, a company what went bankrupt earlier this year. Merck, a German company, had another oral multiple sclerosis drug cladribine, which failed to make the jump to market earlier and was canceled. The head of global development, Susan Herbert said, “Over the years we (Merck) have continuously worked on developing innovative treatment options that meet the individual needs of people living with multiple sclerosis.” Before it was bought by Merck KGaA, PI-2301, was a second generation originally by Teva's Copaxone. It was thought to enhance the regulated response immune system. Earlier this year Merck recently acquired the PI-2301, which is due to lose all patent protection in 2014, and generic companies can start competing for business. Merck is already facing generic companies, but still managed to make $3.3 billion last year in 2010. The PI-2301is designed to improve the regulatory response of the immune system, which is one of the main causes of multiple sclerosis. Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is a disabling disorder. The autoimmune disorder affects the brain and spinal cord and mistakenly attacks and damages healthy body tissue. Multiple sclerosis affects more women than men most commonly between the ages of 20 and 40, but symptoms can be seen at any age. The myelin sheath is damaged and the nerve impulses are stopped or slowed down completely. The PI-2301 works to control the pathogenic autoimmune response which would prevent some mistakenly destroyed myelin sheath. Merck already makes a drug to treat multiple sclerosis called Rebif. Peptimmune, now bankrupt, had two additional MS drug candidates, which are ready to enter Phase I clinical trails. One drug, ARX 424, is a long acting interferon and the other drug ATX-MS-1467 is an immune-tolerizing agent. The PI-2301, has already been approved last year in Australia and Russia, but is facing issues in other European countries. 	1	0	Stuff|could|always|be|worse	I|share|a|guest|post|from|Chipper|at|Healthline.com|.|This|seems|hopeful|to|me|when|more|medications|are|in|the|pipeline|for|MS|...|You|decide|for|yourself|...|Pharmaceutical|company|,|Merck|KGaA|,|has|acquired|exclusive|worldwide|rights|to|PI|-|2301|,|which|is|an|experimental|drug|for|multiple|sclerosis|.|The|drug|has|already|completed|Phase|II|clinical|trials|.|The|PI|-|2301|was|previously|owned|by|Peptimmune|,|a|company|what|went|bankrupt|earlier|this|year|.|Merck|,|a|German|company|,|had|another|oral|multiple|sclerosis|drug|cladribine|,|which|failed|to|make|the|jump|to|market|earlier|and|was|canceled|.|The|head|of|global|development|,|Susan|Herbert|said|,|“|Over|the|years|we|(|Merck|)|have|continuously|worked|on|developing|innovative|treatment|options|that|meet|the|individual|needs|of|people|living|with|multiple|sclerosis|.|”|Before|it|was|bought|by|Merck|KGaA|,|PI|-|2301|,|was|a|second|generation|originally|by|Teva's|Copaxone|.|It|was|thought|to|enhance|the|regulated|response|immune|system|.|Earlier|this|year|Merck|recently|acquired|the|PI|-|2301|,|which|is|due|to|lose|all|patent|protection|in|2014|,|and|generic|companies|can|start|competing|for|business|.|Merck|is|already|facing|generic|companies|,|but|still|managed|to|make|$|3.3|billion|last|year|in|2010|.|The|PI|-|2301is|designed|to|improve|the|regulatory|response|of|the|immune|system|,|which|is|one|of|the|main|causes|of|multiple|sclerosis|.|Multiple|Sclerosis|is|a|chronic|,|inflammatory|condition|of|the|central|nervous|system|and|is|a|disabling|disorder|.|The|autoimmune|disorder|affects|the|brain|and|spinal|cord|and|mistakenly|attacks|and|damages|healthy|body|tissue|.|Multiple|sclerosis|affects|more|women|than|men|most|commonly|between|the|ages|of|20|and|40|,|but|symptoms|can|be|seen|at|any|age|.|The|myelin|sheath|is|damaged|and|the|nerve|impulses|are|stopped|or|slowed|down|completely|.|The|PI|-|2301|works|to|control|the|pathogenic|autoimmune|response|which|would|prevent|some|mistakenly|destroyed|myelin|sheath|.|Merck|already|makes|a|drug|to|treat|multiple|sclerosis|called|Rebif|.|Peptimmune|,|now|bankrupt|,|had|two|additional|MS|drug|candidates|,|which|are|ready|to|enter|Phase|I|clinical|trails|.|One|drug|,|ARX|424|,|is|a|long|acting|interferon|and|the|other|drug|ATX-MS|-|1467|is|an|immune-tolerizing|agent|.|The|PI|-|2301|,|has|already|been|approved|last|year|in|Australia|and|Russia|,|but|is|facing|issues|in|other|European|countries|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694311188252621293/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	Diagnosed around 05' three years after blowing out three disks in the lumbar spine. It's been a rough road, a big moment in my life was when I found out my wife was having online relations with another man, we argued, I had just begun taking one of the oral meds for my ms. Well I had many prescriptions in my medicine cabinet because of the back injury, ms, depression etc.... She began dumping my meds in the toilet, when all was said and done 7 scripts gone and I was going to jail. 5 days later went home reconciled with her, jump forward to a year ago, we sell our home in Northern California and move up to gods country Washington to be closer to her sister, one year later she takes off and she is now living with another man. I have always told her she would not be taking care of me because of health issues when we get old. A week after she leaves my back spasms and I have to literally crawl on my knees back into the house before I could stand up again. It's hard now I have two German Shepard dogs who are incredible at shedding all over, sweep it on a Monday do it again on weds. And a step son who I've raised since he was 5, he is in Jerusalem for schooling for missionary work, and an 18yo daughter who goes to Seattle in two weeks to join the navy. Wow, that's a lot the thought of being alone after 15 yrs is a bummer, but worse yet is when my back flared up I really coulda used a hand. I just can't train the dogs to do the dishes. They have only a few demands, food, play, potty. I love them though. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	Diagnosed|around|05|'|three|years|after|blowing|out|three|disks|in|the|lumbar|spine|.|It's|been|a|rough|road|,|a|big|moment|in|my|life|was|when|I|found|out|my|wife|was|having|online|relations|with|another|man|,|we|argued|,|I|had|just|begun|taking|one|of|the|oral|meds|for|my|ms|.|Well|I|had|many|prescriptions|in|my|medicine|cabinet|because|of|the|back|injury|,|ms|,|depression|etc|...|She|began|dumping|my|meds|in|the|toilet|,|when|all|was|said|and|done|7|scripts|gone|and|I|was|going|to|jail|.|5|days|later|went|home|reconciled|with|her|,|jump|forward|to|a|year|ago|,|we|sell|our|home|in|Northern|California|and|move|up|to|gods|country|Washington|to|be|closer|to|her|sister|,|one|year|later|she|takes|off|and|she|is|now|living|with|another|man|.|I|have|always|told|her|she|would|not|be|taking|care|of|me|because|of|health|issues|when|we|get|old|.|A|week|after|she|leaves|my|back|spasms|and|I|have|to|literally|crawl|on|my|knees|back|into|the|house|before|I|could|stand|up|again|.|It's|hard|now|I|have|two|German|Shepard|dogs|who|are|incredible|at|shedding|all|over|,|sweep|it|on|a|Monday|do|it|again|on|weds|.|And|a|step|son|who|I've|raised|since|he|was|5|,|he|is|in|Jerusalem|for|schooling|for|missionary|work|,|and|an|18yo|daughter|who|goes|to|Seattle|in|two|weeks|to|join|the|navy|.|Wow|,|that's|a|lot|the|thought|of|being|alone|after|15|yrs|is|a|bummer|,|but|worse|yet|is|when|my|back|flared|up|I|really|coulda|used|a|hand|.|I|just|can't|train|the|dogs|to|do|the|dishes|.|They|have|only|a|few|demands|,|food|,|play|,|potty|.|I|love|them|though|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694670552493578752/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	Hi My name is Megan I am 26 years old and I was diagnosed in March of 2012. In July of 2011 I woke up with blurred vision in my right eye. After meeting with my Eye Dr he sent me to an eye specialist The same day to conclude I had optic neuritis and with in 24 hours I was In an MRI machine and was meeting with the MS clinic within 48 hour. I got my diagnosis with in six months. Since my first cause of optic neuritis . I have had a few more relapses. I got optic neuritis in my left eye ( both eyes have cleared up but damage to each nerve was done) I have also had a relapse where my eyes were not in sync with each other and there was a delay in my vision. My worst relapse by far was back from October 2013 to the end of December 2013. After weeks of being sick and finally the Neurologist deciding to do an MRI to conclude what was wrong they found a lesion on the base of my brain and my spinal cord that was telling my body I didnt need to eat, so for 8 weeks I didn't. I went down a large amount of wait but had little to no energy at all and was in a semi disabled state unable to do tasks for myself. I also was having other symptoms related to this relapse that included tingling in my feet, vertigo, and urine hesitancy. I did steroids for this relapse and it seemed to clear up pretty good but took a solid month or two for me to get back to my Normal self. I have relapses here and there and am currently in another one right now where both my hands are numb and it has been going on for about 4 weeks but My neurologist doesnt want to do treatment because I am not in pain So I am trying to live with it but it is defiantly a constant reminder that I have MS and its not going away. I dont know anyone who has MS so I am hoping that this site will help me find people to talk to about symptoms I am having and other peoples story's as well as struggles. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	Hi|My|name|is|Megan|I|am|26|years|old|and|I|was|diagnosed|in|March|of|2012|.|In|July|of|2011|I|woke|up|with|blurred|vision|in|my|right|eye|.|After|meeting|with|my|Eye|Dr|he|sent|me|to|an|eye|specialist|The|same|day|to|conclude|I|had|optic|neuritis|and|with|in|24|hours|I|was|In|an|MRI|machine|and|was|meeting|with|the|MS|clinic|within|48|hour|.|I|got|my|diagnosis|with|in|six|months|.|Since|my|first|cause|of|optic|neuritis|.|I|have|had|a|few|more|relapses|.|I|got|optic|neuritis|in|my|left|eye|(|both|eyes|have|cleared|up|but|damage|to|each|nerve|was|done|)|I|have|also|had|a|relapse|where|my|eyes|were|not|in|sync|with|each|other|and|there|was|a|delay|in|my|vision|.|My|worst|relapse|by|far|was|back|from|October|2013|to|the|end|of|December|2013|.|After|weeks|of|being|sick|and|finally|the|Neurologist|deciding|to|do|an|MRI|to|conclude|what|was|wrong|they|found|a|lesion|on|the|base|of|my|brain|and|my|spinal|cord|that|was|telling|my|body|I|didnt|need|to|eat|,|so|for|8|weeks|I|didn't|.|I|went|down|a|large|amount|of|wait|but|had|little|to|no|energy|at|all|and|was|in|a|semi|disabled|state|unable|to|do|tasks|for|myself|.|I|also|was|having|other|symptoms|related|to|this|relapse|that|included|tingling|in|my|feet|,|vertigo|,|and|urine|hesitancy|.|I|did|steroids|for|this|relapse|and|it|seemed|to|clear|up|pretty|good|but|took|a|solid|month|or|two|for|me|to|get|back|to|my|Normal|self|.|I|have|relapses|here|and|there|and|am|currently|in|another|one|right|now|where|both|my|hands|are|numb|and|it|has|been|going|on|for|about|4|weeks|but|My|neurologist|doesnt|want|to|do|treatment|because|I|am|not|in|pain|So|I|am|trying|to|live|with|it|but|it|is|defiantly|a|constant|reminder|that|I|have|MS|and|its|not|going|away|.|I|dont|know|anyone|who|has|MS|so|I|am|hoping|that|this|site|will|help|me|find|people|to|talk|to|about|symptoms|I|am|having|and|other|peoples|story's|as|well|as|struggles|.

I found that I could barely stand near the end of my shifts at my new retail job. When I was newly diagnosed it was devastating but it was barely affecting my life so I kept moving forward, going to college and working. I use a cane now because I trip/fall frequently and I have tried different types of treatments. I hope to be cured from this or even gain my walking ability back and hope to emotionally help those in need. I know how it feels to not be heard or understood, MS is a hard concept for a lot of people to grasp and I hope to bridge that gap. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	MS|became|a|big|part|of|my|life|when|I|was|19|.|I|found|that|I|could|barely|stand|near|the|end|of|my|shifts|at|my|new|retail|job|.|When|I|was|newly|diagnosed|it|was|devastating|but|it|was|barely|affecting|my|life|so|I|kept|moving|forward|,|going|to|college|and|working|.|I|use|a|cane|now|because|I|trip|/|fall|frequently|and|I|have|tried|different|types|of|treatments|.|I|hope|to|be|cured|from|this|or|even|gain|my|walking|ability|back|and|hope|to|emotionally|help|those|in|need|.|I|know|how|it|feels|to|not|be|heard|or|understood|,|MS|is|a|hard|concept|for|a|lot|of|people|to|grasp|and|I|hope|to|bridge|that|gap|.

First I would like to ask if the pain is also in your cheek and mouth and is it limited to those areas or does it also sometimes extend to other areas on that side of your body? Also do you have flair ups that cause swelling in one side of your face? If so you might want to talk to your Neurologist about Trigeminal or another form of neuralgia. It is a common co-morbidity in MS and very painful.

Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again. What Afinitor is used for. Afinitor is used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer; neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), a type of cancer located in the stomach and intestine, lung or pancreas; tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with angiomyolipoma of the kidney (a kidney tumour) not requiring immediate surgery; TSC with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (sometimes called 'SEGA'), a specific type of brain tumour not requiring immediate surgery or certain types of seizures (epilepsy) associated with TSC in children and adults. Afinitor is also used in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive HER2 negative advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women, in conjunction with exemestane after failure of letrozole or anastrozole. It is only used in patients whose tumour has tested negative to HER2. Everolimus is the active substance in Afinitor. Treatment of kidney cancer. Afinitor stops the cancer from making new cells and cuts off the blood supply. This slows the growth and spread of the cancer. Treatment of NETs. Afinitor is used to control the growth of these tumours located in the stomach and intestine, lung or pancreas. Treatment of SEGA. Afinitor reduces the size of brain tumours (SEGA) that are caused by a genetic disorder called tuberous sclerosis. This may stop the tumours from causing problems as they grow, such as hydrocephalus (excessive accumulation of fluid within the brain). Treatment of TSC with angiomyolipoma of the kidney. Afinitor may reduce the size of angiomyolipoma of the kidney that is associated with a genetic disorder called TSC. This may lower the risk of the tumour(s) causing bleeding complications and may help to preserve kidney function. Treatment of TSC with seizures. Afinitor may reduce the frequency of seizures in patients with a genetic disorder called TSC. Treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2 negative advanced breast cancer. Growth of this type of breast cancer is stimulated by oestrogens which are female sex hormones. Oestrogen inhibitors such as letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane reduce the amount of oestrogen and can slow the growth of breast cancers. After failure of letrozole or anastrozole, exemestane is used in combination with Afinitor to prevent the breast cancer cells from becoming resistant to the exemestane. The medicine is started by a specialist doctor experienced in tumour treatments. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason. Afinitor is available only with a doctor's prescription and is not addictive. Children and adolescents. AFINITOR is not to be used in children or adolescents for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2 negative advanced breast cancer, advanced neuroendocrine tumours or advanced kidney cancer.

We also welcome your suggestions for improving the site. I know MS Discovery well--I find it an excellent source of information that I use regularly! Paul M. Matthews, OBE, MD, DPhil, FRCP, FMedSci. Edmund J. and Lily Safra Professor of Translational Neuroscience and Therapeutics. Head, Division of Brain Sciences. Department of Medicine. Imperial College, London. I LOVE your site! I am a very experienced UK MS Specialist Nurse, caring for people with MS over decades, but have just discovered the wealth of updated, and shared, knowledge your site has to offer. I so wish I had had you 30 years ago. Thank you. I am inspired. Dear Editor,. I am writing to inform you that I have highlighted some content from the MS Discovery forum on a recent blog post. The post, which covers MS-related blogs and other sites that are particularly accessible to scientific laypeople (patients!) can be found here: http://treetownchem.blogspot.com/2014/03/making-sense-of-multiple-sclerosis.html. I've only discovered the MSDF in the past few days but can't wait to read more of this excellent journalism. I am an inorganic chemist by trade. Since my mother was diagnosed a few years ago I have been struggling to get the vocabulary needed to understand the MS research literature, but the MSDF looks like it distills the ideas very effectively. Thank you for creating a great community! Jimmy Brancho, Inorganic Chemistry Ph.D. Candidate, University of Michigan. MSDF Senior Science Journalist Carol Cruzan Morton covered the American Society of Neurochemistry (ASN) meeting in Long Beach, California in March 2014. Here's a message ASN meeting manager Sheillah Jewart sent to all of the society's members:. At the recent ASN meeting in Long Beach, you may have noticed Carol Morton, a Senior Science Journalist from MS Discovery, conducting interviews and attending the sessions. Here is her first article and stay tuned for other stories from the meeting. ""Rare Family Cluster of MS Reveals New Clues,"" based on talks from the LKB1 session at the recent ASN meeting in Long Beach. You can link directly to the story at http://www.msdiscovery.org/news/new_findings/10319-rare-family-cluster-ms-reveals-new-clues MS Discovery Forum is a growing dynamic scientific community of researchers and physicians. Check out MSDF news and resources and sign up (it’s free) to comment on stories and papers, to post meeting announcements and jobs, and to help us shape the site so it serves the diverse needs of the MS research community. It's all in the interests of speeding progress toward new and better treatments for -- or prevention of -- multiple sclerosis. (Your comments also help show site engagement to potential funders, which will help ensure MSDF's ongoing support and success.). Sheillah Jewart, American Society of Neurochemistry. One of the articles Carol Morton wrote from the ASN meeting resulted in a nice comment from a researcher quoted in the article:. Thanks Carol for this attractive looking and handsomely written piece!!! Everybody is commenting on how well it is written and how good the article looks. So far one potential collaborator re scientific experiments whom we already met at ASN meeting. That's good. Anne Boullerne, University of Illinois, Chicago. Thank you very much for . . . alerting me to your excellent website. I really enjoyed reading through some of the very well written and concise summaries of papers on the site. It will certainly be one of my go to sites in keeping up to date. David Paling, MB ChB, University College, London. “I am very impressed ... a really useful and interesting site.”. Dr. Alasdair Coles, Senior Lecturer, University of Cambridge. “The site looks very good... The articles are very high quality and I congratulate you and your writers.”. Tim Vollmer, MD, Professor and Director of Clinical Research, University of Colorado. “I’ve had a look at your site and must congratulate you on such a fine job ... This will be a very valuable resource for the MS community.”. Juan Carlos Lopez, Editor, Nature Medicine. “The MSDF is a lifeline for those of us who struggle to keep up with the vast array of new research findings in multiple sclerosis - particularly in areas where we don't have particular expertise. The articles' brevity, and their clear and engaging style, fit perfectly with the schedules of busy researchers. Over time, this model should increase the relevance of our work.”. Daniel S. Reich, MD, PhD, Chief, Translational Neuroradiology Unit, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. “The multiple sclerosis field is substantially more difficult at this moment to try to wrap one’s arms around. But the wonderful thing about this moment in time for MS is that there are a good number of drugs that may alter the natural history of the disease. It is probably a generation-long task to work them all into a logical, coherent therapeutic armamentarium. I think that [MSDF] will help in that process by being an honest broker … an authentically important goal.”. Dr. Richard Ransohoff as quoted by Science Translational Medicine in an article about MS Discovery Forum . “Your article [on imaging] is excellent. You’ve covered tremendous ground and spoken to many well-chosen experts to balance your reporting. This piece really covers ‘MS Imaging in 2012,’ and I’ll recommend it to students and residents who want a quick and comprehensive overview of the field.”. Rob Naismith, MD, Assistant Professor of Neurology, Washington University.

Developed by Khawai . Understanding and analyzing the design of past clinical trials is a key factor in planning future trials. This visualization details the design of 88 clinical trials with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports published between 1993 and 2014. It makes it easy to see which of five key measurements were reported in each trial and when during the course of that trial those measurements were made. The measurements are:. * Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). * Gadolinium-enhancing lesion (GdEnh Lesion). * T2-hyperintense lesion volume (Volume T2). * Brain Volume. * Combined Active Lesion (CAL). The top chart combines information from all the trials in each of the four phases. The size of each circle is a function of the number of trials reporting this measurement. Switching between phases will allow you to visualize the differences in the frequency and the type of data available. The bottom chart displays information on individual trials. Select a trial with the drop-down menu to update the chart.

Halliday AM, McDonald WI, Mushin J. 1972 May 6; 1(7758):982-5. PMID: 4112367. Suggested By Alastair Compston and alasdair coles. In their 1972 study, Ian McDonald and Martin Halliday showed that visual evoked potentials can detect past episodes of optic neuritis, and thus introduced a non-invasive test to assist in the diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis. Halliday had been measuring evoked potentials in people with multiple sclerosis for the previous decade; meanwhile, McDonald and Tom Sears had shown that demyelinating lesions impair nerve conduction. This study found delayed evoked potentials in 19 patients with unilateral optic neuritis for as long as 5 years after their vision returned to normal, suggesting that “the technique described here provides a useful objective test for previous damage to the optic nerve.” The authors went on to find abnormal evoked potentials in patients with a previous history of optic neuritis and also in patients with no history of optic neuritis. They later proposed diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis that incorporated visual evoked potentials. To date, the only clinical diagnostic test that can demonstrate that a central neurological lesion is demyelinating is the cortical evoked potential, of which the pattern-evoked visual potential is by far the most sensitive and robust. 	1	0	Delayed|visual|evoked|response|in|optic|neuritis|.|-|Multiple|Sclerosis|Discovery|Forum	Delayed|visual|evoked|response|in|optic|neuritis|.|-|Multiple|Sclerosis|Discovery|Forum|.|Halliday|AM|,|McDonald|WI|,|Mushin|J|.|1972|May|6|;|1|(|7758|):|982-5|.|PMID|:|4112367|.|Suggested|By|Alastair|Compston|and|alasdair|coles|.|In|their|1972|study|,|Ian|McDonald|and|Martin|Halliday|showed|that|visual|evoked|potentials|can|detect|past|episodes|of|optic|neuritis|,|and|thus|introduced|a|non-invasive|test|to|assist|in|the|diagnosis|of|suspected|multiple|sclerosis|.|Halliday|had|been|measuring|evoked|potentials|in|people|with|multiple|sclerosis|for|the|previous|decade|;|meanwhile|,|McDonald|and|Tom|Sears|had|shown|that|demyelinating|lesions|impair|nerve|conduction|.|This|study|found|delayed|evoked|potentials|in|19|patients|with|unilateral|optic|neuritis|for|as|long|as|5|years|after|their|vision|returned|to|normal|,|suggesting|that|“|the|technique|described|here|provides|a|useful|objective|test|for|previous|damage|to|the|optic|nerve|.|”|The|authors|went|on|to|find|abnormal|evoked|potentials|in|patients|with|a|previous|history|of|optic|neuritis|and|also|in|patients|with|no|history|of|optic|neuritis|.|They|later|proposed|diagnostic|criteria|for|multiple|sclerosis|that|incorporated|visual|evoked|potentials|.|To|date|,|the|only|clinical|diagnostic|test|that|can|demonstrate|that|a|central|neurological|lesion|is|demyelinating|is|the|cortical|evoked|potential|,|of|which|the|pattern-evoked|visual|potential|is|by|far|the|most|sensitive|and|robust|.

Developed by Khawai . This data visualization makes it easy to zoom in on peer reviewed articles or clinical trial listings describing phase 2, phase 3, and phase 4 (post marketing) clinical trials with a randomized, double-blind control in multiple sclerosis. Included in this ""tree map"" are pointers to every article and Clinicaltrials. gov listing meeting the above criteria referenced in our Drug Development Pipeline as of June 1, 2014. The published articles describe the major results of 108 clinical trials involving 53,316 patients. A Tree Map is a space-filling approach to showing hierarchies in which the rectangular screen space is divided into regions, and then each region is divided again for each level in the hierarchy. Tree maps have the advantage of making efficient use of space, with the potential to clearly display thousands of items on the screen simultaneously. The regions in the tree map have an area proportional to the number of clinical trials they contain, allowing the user to identify patterns, such as which populations and which compounds are the most studied. Click on a label or a region to zoom in. You will eventually come to links to a trial’s listing in Clinicaltrials. gov or, for a published study, its PubMed abstract.

Association for Research in Nervous and Mental Diseases (ARNMD) vol 2. New York: Herber, 1921: 8–19. Suggested By George Ebers. This was the first systematic study showing that the geography of MS had unexplained irregularity. Davenport became somewhat controversial later because of his interests and studies in eugenics (a scientific zeitgeist among his contemporaries in educated circles). He studied the occurrence of MS in U.S. World War I veterans and showed the high prevalence around the Great Lakes, something that was attributed to the Scandinavian origins of much of this population at the time. This continues to the present to a degree, c.f. the Swedes of Minnesota and the Finns around the northern lakeshores, e.g., Thunder Bay. Later, the migration of Norwegians to the U.S. Northwest, making up some 50% of the migrants in the mid-19 th century, would show up in the geography of veterans with MS. The highest U.S. rates by state continue to be in Washington state. The U.S. VA records proved grist for John Kurtzke’s mill and his industry and determination was to be most productive, but the use of the veteran’s databases began here and with Beebe (Beebe et al. , 1967) . 	1	0	Multiple|sclerosis|from|the|standpoint|of|geographic|distribution|and|race|-|Multiple|Sclerosis|Discovery|Forum	Multiple|sclerosis|from|the|standpoint|of|geographic|distribution|and|race|.|Association|for|Research|in|Nervous|and|Mental|Diseases|(|ARNMD|)|vol|2|.|New|York|:|Herber|,|1921|:|8|–|19|.|Suggested|By|George|Ebers|.|This|was|the|first|systematic|study|showing|that|the|geography|of|MS|had|unexplained|irregularity|.|Davenport|became|somewhat|controversial|later|because|of|his|interests|and|studies|in|eugenics|(|a|scientific|zeitgeist|among|his|contemporaries|in|educated|circles|)|.|He|studied|the|occurrence|of|MS|in|U|.|S|.|World|War|I|veterans|and|showed|the|high|prevalence|around|the|Great|Lakes|,|something|that|was|attributed|to|the|Scandinavian|origins|of|much|of|this|population|at|the|time|.|This|continues|to|the|present|to|a|degree|,|c|.|f|.|the|Swedes|of|Minnesota|and|the|Finns|around|the|northern|lakeshores|,|e|.|g|.|,|Thunder|Bay|.|Later|,|the|migration|of|Norwegians|to|the|U|.|S|.|Northwest|,|making|up|some|50|%|of|the|migrants|in|the|mid|-|19|th|century|,|would|show|up|in|the|geography|of|veterans|with|MS|.|The|highest|U|.|S|.|rates|by|state|continue|to|be|in|Washington|state|.|The|U|.|S|.|VA|records|proved|grist|for|John|Kurtzke|’|s|mill|and|his|industry|and|determination|was|to|be|most|productive|,|but|the|use|of|the|veteran|’|s|databases|began|here|and|with|Beebe|(|Beebe|et|al|.|,|1967|)|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531525928179630/MS-Ireland--::-Spasticity	MS Ireland  :: Spasticity	MS Ireland  ::. Spasticity is characterised by an increase in tone in a muscle group, so that there is stiffness and resistance as the muscle is moved. In MS, it can impair mobility, produce pain, and significantly impact daily living. Spasticity can increase intermittently (cramping) or increase chronically. Complications from spasticity include pain, joint contractures, frozen joints, impaired bladder or bowel function, skin ulceration, and abnormal postures and falls. In this section we talk about how to best deal with spasticity, a painful symptom that can impact almost every activity of daily living. How is spasticity assessed & treated? Spasticity is measured by the degree of passive resistance to the stretch of muscles around joints, using the Ashworth or modified Ashworth scales. Usually carried out by a Chartered Physiotherapist. Treatment of spasticity involves both medications and physical approaches. Over-treating spasticity can impede mobility. 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|Spasticity	MS|Ireland|::|.|Spasticity|is|characterised|by|an|increase|in|tone|in|a|muscle|group|,|so|that|there|is|stiffness|and|resistance|as|the|muscle|is|moved|.|In|MS|,|it|can|impair|mobility|,|produce|pain|,|and|significantly|impact|daily|living|.|Spasticity|can|increase|intermittently|(|cramping|)|or|increase|chronically|.|Complications|from|spasticity|include|pain|,|joint|contractures|,|frozen|joints|,|impaired|bladder|or|bowel|function|,|skin|ulceration|,|and|abnormal|postures|and|falls|.|In|this|section|we|talk|about|how|to|best|deal|with|spasticity|,|a|painful|symptom|that|can|impact|almost|every|activity|of|daily|living|.|How|is|spasticity|assessed|&|treated|?|Spasticity|is|measured|by|the|degree|of|passive|resistance|to|the|stretch|of|muscles|around|joints|,|using|the|Ashworth|or|modified|Ashworth|scales|.|Usually|carried|out|by|a|Chartered|Physiotherapist|.|Treatment|of|spasticity|involves|both|medications|and|physical|approaches|.|Over-treating|spasticity|can|impede|mobility|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531460378067515/MS-Ireland--::-Fatigue	MS Ireland  :: Fatigue	MS Ireland  ::. Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms experienced by people with MS and, for some, it is the symptom that affects them most. Different people have different experiences of fatigue and it can impact on all aspects of life. It can come and go, or change over time and could be one of the first symptoms you experience, or something that appears years later. Fatigue is difficult to explain. In MS, it is not just an ordinary tiredness that people might experience after a hard day’s work or strenuous exercise. Many describe it as an overwhelming sense of tiredness for no apparent reason. Some people become tired after very little activity, or rarely wake up feeling refreshed in the morning. While there is still much to learn about the exact causes of fatigue in MS, many people have found ways to minimise its effects. Health and social care professionals can help with managing fatigue, but because fatigue in MS may have a variety of causes, and affects each person differently, there is no ‘one size fits all’ treatment. Some people may be prescribed drugs, though, for many, a combination of self-management strategies, physiotherapy and exercise helps reduce the impact of their fatigue.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531546298802646/MS-Ireland--::-Symptoms	MS Ireland  :: Symptoms	MS Ireland  ::. The presence, severity and duration of all MS symptoms vary considerably from person to person. The unpredictable nature of the condition can sometimes make it hard to manage. However, over time, many people begin to notice patterns and triggers to their symptoms, and with appropriate treatment and intervention, many symptoms can be managed quite successfully. Some of the symptoms of MS are immediately obvious. Reduced mobility is often the most visually apparent. Other symptoms such as fatigue , changes in sensation, memory and concentration problems are often ‘hidden’ symptoms and can be difficult to explain to others. No matter what the symptoms are, it is important to alert your GP or Neurologist when a new symptom appears, or an existing symptom changes. Managing symptoms is not just about drug treatments , and many people find a healthy lifestyle also helps. A balanced diet , appropriate exercise and keeping stress at a minimum can give your body and mind the best chance to deal with symptoms. Some people with MS find complementary therapies helpful. Many of these therapies promote wellbeing holistically; the focus being on the person and not just the symptoms. Remember to speak to your doctor first before starting any form of alternative therapy . Managing symptoms is part of the overall management of the effects of MS. Symptoms not only affect the functioning of the body physically, emotionally and cognitively, they can also affect your work, social life and family. It is important that you look at your everyday life and look at any changes you can which will help you manage your MS as successfully as possible. 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|Symptoms	MS|Ireland|::|.|The|presence|,|severity|and|duration|of|all|MS|symptoms|vary|considerably|from|person|to|person|.|The|unpredictable|nature|of|the|condition|can|sometimes|make|it|hard|to|manage|.|However|,|over|time|,|many|people|begin|to|notice|patterns|and|triggers|to|their|symptoms|,|and|with|appropriate|treatment|and|intervention|,|many|symptoms|can|be|managed|quite|successfully|.|Some|of|the|symptoms|of|MS|are|immediately|obvious|.|Reduced|mobility|is|often|the|most|visually|apparent|.|Other|symptoms|such|as|fatigue|,|changes|in|sensation|,|memory|and|concentration|problems|are|often|‘|hidden|’|symptoms|and|can|be|difficult|to|explain|to|others|.|No|matter|what|the|symptoms|are|,|it|is|important|to|alert|your|GP|or|Neurologist|when|a|new|symptom|appears|,|or|an|existing|symptom|changes|.|Managing|symptoms|is|not|just|about|drug|treatments|,|and|many|people|find|a|healthy|lifestyle|also|helps|.|A|balanced|diet|,|appropriate|exercise|and|keeping|stress|at|a|minimum|can|give|your|body|and|mind|the|best|chance|to|deal|with|symptoms|.|Some|people|with|MS|find|complementary|therapies|helpful|.|Many|of|these|therapies|promote|wellbeing|holistically|;|the|focus|being|on|the|person|and|not|just|the|symptoms|.|Remember|to|speak|to|your|doctor|first|before|starting|any|form|of|alternative|therapy|.|Managing|symptoms|is|part|of|the|overall|management|of|the|effects|of|MS|.|Symptoms|not|only|affect|the|functioning|of|the|body|physically|,|emotionally|and|cognitively|,|they|can|also|affect|your|work|,|social|life|and|family|.|It|is|important|that|you|look|at|your|everyday|life|and|look|at|any|changes|you|can|which|will|help|you|manage|your|MS|as|successfully|as|possible|.

They are a great source of information and advice. They may also act as a link between hospital, community services and social services. If you have not already been offered an appointment with an MS nurse, you can ask your GP or neurologist for a referral. Occasionally, MS nurses take self-referrals, which means you can ring them directly and ask for an appointment. Ideally, you should be referred to an MS nurse as soon as you are diagnosed. They often become the first point of contact for any concerns about your MS (though a GP should be the person to contact about general health queries). Some of the issues you might contact your MS Nurse about are if you:. Not every hospital in Ireland has an MS nurse. If there isn’t one in your area, it is worth asking if you can be referred to a specialist neurological nurse or someone else with an understanding of MS who can act as a central point of contact.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531548507245983/MS-Ireland--::-Pharmacist	MS Ireland  :: Pharmacist	MS Ireland  ::. Pharmacists provide pharmaceutical care to patients both while they are in hospital and at home. This means the pharmacist can help people with MS get the maximum benefit from the medicines that have been prescribed for them. Pharmacists can also help doctors choose the best medicines and the best way of administering them. The pharmacist will also ensure that people have a continuous supply of their medicines. It is important that people with MS have the right information about their medicines so they can feel confident about taking them, with the minimum number of unwanted side effects and the maximum benefit. During their stay in hospital, people with MS may be visited by the hospital pharmacist and given advice about their medications and how best to take them. When it is time for the person to go home, the hospital pharmacist can help draw-up a plan to ensure that the person with MS, their carers and community pharmacist have all the information they need to ensure the smooth running of any continuing treatment. The community pharmacist will provide ongoing advice and information about the medications, and will liaise with the GP and other community health care providers. A pharmacist can inform and interpret drug or treatment information, so they can help people with MS and their carers by giving an informed opinion about their medicines, including how they may act or interact together and reported or expected side effects. A pharmacist can help to answer any queries that a person with MS may have about their treatment options. While in hospital, the person with MS may see their hospital pharmacist every weekday. Alternatively he/she can ask a nurse to contact the hospital pharmacist and arrange a meeting with them if required. While at home, the person with MS should contact their community pharmacist if they have any problems or queries about their medications. People with MS are automatically entitled to a Long-Term Illness Card. This means that all their medication related to their MS is free. A straightforward application form must be completed to avail of this. More information on how to apply to the Long Term Illness Scheme. Resources and information. The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has produced a Patient Charter that lays out what you should be able to expect from your pharmacist. 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|Pharmacist	MS|Ireland|::|.|Pharmacists|provide|pharmaceutical|care|to|patients|both|while|they|are|in|hospital|and|at|home|.|This|means|the|pharmacist|can|help|people|with|MS|get|the|maximum|benefit|from|the|medicines|that|have|been|prescribed|for|them|.|Pharmacists|can|also|help|doctors|choose|the|best|medicines|and|the|best|way|of|administering|them|.|The|pharmacist|will|also|ensure|that|people|have|a|continuous|supply|of|their|medicines|.|It|is|important|that|people|with|MS|have|the|right|information|about|their|medicines|so|they|can|feel|confident|about|taking|them|,|with|the|minimum|number|of|unwanted|side|effects|and|the|maximum|benefit|.|During|their|stay|in|hospital|,|people|with|MS|may|be|visited|by|the|hospital|pharmacist|and|given|advice|about|their|medications|and|how|best|to|take|them|.|When|it|is|time|for|the|person|to|go|home|,|the|hospital|pharmacist|can|help|draw-up|a|plan|to|ensure|that|the|person|with|MS|,|their|carers|and|community|pharmacist|have|all|the|information|they|need|to|ensure|the|smooth|running|of|any|continuing|treatment|.|The|community|pharmacist|will|provide|ongoing|advice|and|information|about|the|medications|,|and|will|liaise|with|the|GP|and|other|community|health|care|providers|.|A|pharmacist|can|inform|and|interpret|drug|or|treatment|information|,|so|they|can|help|people|with|MS|and|their|carers|by|giving|an|informed|opinion|about|their|medicines|,|including|how|they|may|act|or|interact|together|and|reported|or|expected|side|effects|.|A|pharmacist|can|help|to|answer|any|queries|that|a|person|with|MS|may|have|about|their|treatment|options|.|While|in|hospital|,|the|person|with|MS|may|see|their|hospital|pharmacist|every|weekday|.|Alternatively|he|/|she|can|ask|a|nurse|to|contact|the|hospital|pharmacist|and|arrange|a|meeting|with|them|if|required|.|While|at|home|,|the|person|with|MS|should|contact|their|community|pharmacist|if|they|have|any|problems|or|queries|about|their|medications|.|People|with|MS|are|automatically|entitled|to|a|Long-Term|Illness|Card|.|This|means|that|all|their|medication|related|to|their|MS|is|free|.|A|straightforward|application|form|must|be|completed|to|avail|of|this|.|More|information|on|how|to|apply|to|the|Long|Term|Illness|Scheme|.|Resources|and|information|.|The|Pharmaceutical|Society|of|Ireland|has|produced|a|Patient|Charter|that|lays|out|what|you|should|be|able|to|expect|from|your|pharmacist|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531534884019186/MS-Ireland--::-Medical-Social-Work	MS Ireland  :: Medical Social Work	MS Ireland  ::. Medical Social Work. Medical Social Worker. As part of the multi-professional team, medical social workers provide skilled psychosocial support to people with MS through counselling and practical assistance. They have expertise in understanding the psychological impact of illness on individuals and can use this information to advise hospital policies which relate to the needs of people with MS. Research has shown that serious illness has a direct impact on the psychological, social, emotional, physical and economic wellbeing of individuals and their families/carers. The medical social worker can identify with the person, their personality traits, coping skills and ways of dealing with the world prior to the onset of the illness. Input from the social worker is invaluable to the neurology team. It enables the team to adapt their style to meet the individual needs of that person. The people themselves can benefit from developing an awareness of their own style of coping and can articulate what is important about the illness and its treatment, come to terms with an often complicated hospital system, and get to know those involved in their care. This is in addition to dealing with strong emotional reactions such as denial, fear, anger, and helplessness. MS can also create many practical and financial problems. Medical social workers intervene with families by addressing both the emotional issues and the practical concerns simultaneously. The Medical Social Work Service provides privacy and confidentiality to people with MS and their families. Medical social workers access a wide-range of services in both the voluntary and statutory sectors. They have an advocacy role in determining the needs of a person with MS and their family’s needs are highlighted and met. They create links and liaise with members of local communities as well as health and social services. Medical social work plays an important role for neurology teams, ensuring that the person with MS is viewed not as an individual entity, but as a person in the context of their overall family and community environment. A person with MS or a family member can access a medical social worker by contacting the Social Worker Department directly in any hospital. Alternatively, they can ask their hospital consultant or a member of the neurology team to make a referral on their behalf. 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|Medical|Social|Work	MS|Ireland|::|.|Medical|Social|Work|.|Medical|Social|Worker|.|As|part|of|the|multi-professional|team|,|medical|social|workers|provide|skilled|psychosocial|support|to|people|with|MS|through|counselling|and|practical|assistance|.|They|have|expertise|in|understanding|the|psychological|impact|of|illness|on|individuals|and|can|use|this|information|to|advise|hospital|policies|which|relate|to|the|needs|of|people|with|MS|.|Research|has|shown|that|serious|illness|has|a|direct|impact|on|the|psychological|,|social|,|emotional|,|physical|and|economic|wellbeing|of|individuals|and|their|families|/|carers|.|The|medical|social|worker|can|identify|with|the|person|,|their|personality|traits|,|coping|skills|and|ways|of|dealing|with|the|world|prior|to|the|onset|of|the|illness|.|Input|from|the|social|worker|is|invaluable|to|the|neurology|team|.|It|enables|the|team|to|adapt|their|style|to|meet|the|individual|needs|of|that|person|.|The|people|themselves|can|benefit|from|developing|an|awareness|of|their|own|style|of|coping|and|can|articulate|what|is|important|about|the|illness|and|its|treatment|,|come|to|terms|with|an|often|complicated|hospital|system|,|and|get|to|know|those|involved|in|their|care|.|This|is|in|addition|to|dealing|with|strong|emotional|reactions|such|as|denial|,|fear|,|anger|,|and|helplessness|.|MS|can|also|create|many|practical|and|financial|problems|.|Medical|social|workers|intervene|with|families|by|addressing|both|the|emotional|issues|and|the|practical|concerns|simultaneously|.|The|Medical|Social|Work|Service|provides|privacy|and|confidentiality|to|people|with|MS|and|their|families|.|Medical|social|workers|access|a|wide-range|of|services|in|both|the|voluntary|and|statutory|sectors|.|They|have|an|advocacy|role|in|determining|the|needs|of|a|person|with|MS|and|their|family|’|s|needs|are|highlighted|and|met|.|They|create|links|and|liaise|with|members|of|local|communities|as|well|as|health|and|social|services|.|Medical|social|work|plays|an|important|role|for|neurology|teams|,|ensuring|that|the|person|with|MS|is|viewed|not|as|an|individual|entity|,|but|as|a|person|in|the|context|of|their|overall|family|and|community|environment|.|A|person|with|MS|or|a|family|member|can|access|a|medical|social|worker|by|contacting|the|Social|Worker|Department|directly|in|any|hospital|.|Alternatively|,|they|can|ask|their|hospital|consultant|or|a|member|of|the|neurology|team|to|make|a|referral|on|their|behalf|.

I have also recently had an appointment with my neurologist who has found several lesions on my spine, it is undetermined whether or not these are new, and has offered me a special kind of infusion.

It was hard, I became depressed and detached I constantly asked myself “ why me, why now?” I found it hard being a regular teenager but somehow I found a way to I found a way to make it work. I knew I couldn't let the obstacle from living my life. With all the days I missed I always had to find a way to make sure I didn't fall behind my fellow classmates. Even with my intense schedule with missing school, I still maintained good grade even in my advance placement classes. I had a difficult time confiding to anyone about my condition not because I was embarrassed but because of the looks I would get after I told them. When I shared my diagnoses to anyone they assumed it was a contagious disease instead of allowing me to explain they immediately stop listening their little knowledge of the disease cause me to lose a lot of people in my life that I called friends but it also showed me my true friends. MS was something that I knew I couldn't let rule my life it was something I had to fight even if I had to fight it every day. I am currently 21 years old. I just started Lemtrada. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	I|was|diagnosed|when|I|was|15|when|my|worst|worry|should|have|been|passing|finals|and|then|suddenly|huge|weight|was|placed|on|my|shoulder|.|It|was|hard|,|I|became|depressed|and|detached|I|constantly|asked|myself|“|why|me|,|why|now|?|”|I|found|it|hard|being|a|regular|teenager|but|somehow|I|found|a|way|to|I|found|a|way|to|make|it|work|.|I|knew|I|couldn't|let|the|obstacle|from|living|my|life|.|With|all|the|days|I|missed|I|always|had|to|find|a|way|to|make|sure|I|didn't|fall|behind|my|fellow|classmates|.|Even|with|my|intense|schedule|with|missing|school|,|I|still|maintained|good|grade|even|in|my|advance|placement|classes|.|I|had|a|difficult|time|confiding|to|anyone|about|my|condition|not|because|I|was|embarrassed|but|because|of|the|looks|I|would|get|after|I|told|them|.|When|I|shared|my|diagnoses|to|anyone|they|assumed|it|was|a|contagious|disease|instead|of|allowing|me|to|explain|they|immediately|stop|listening|their|little|knowledge|of|the|disease|cause|me|to|lose|a|lot|of|people|in|my|life|that|I|called|friends|but|it|also|showed|me|my|true|friends|.|MS|was|something|that|I|knew|I|couldn't|let|rule|my|life|it|was|something|I|had|to|fight|even|if|I|had|to|fight|it|every|day|.|I|am|currently|21|years|old|.|I|just|started|Lemtrada|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693250087712843462/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	I began noticing numbness in my fingertips but I was only seeing a chiropractor for lower back pain. He could not help me. Then a new chiropractor could not give me a decent reason why I could not walk so good after another year. I would get tired after a few blocks. I mentioned it to my primary care doctor and she had me take tests and see many doctors for additional symptoms, but the neurologist could explain my concerns. By this time, I assumed the fatigue had to do with menopause although my walking was stilted and hard. Another year after trying different chiropractors, the one who cured my frozen shoulders tested me and guessed, but could not diagnose. He instead had my doctor send me to another neurologist who gave me a head MRI and spent time explaining my new diagnosis. I've done a great deal of reading, talking to others with MS and worrying about continued employment with increasing problems. I've had to take an early retirement from teaching. I now juice almost daily for energy, use a vibration machine for exercise, started a gluten-free diet which has shown an increase in energy and cognition; I somehow just found this site even though I read the newsletter and magazine the same day I receive it. I keep up with MS sufferers on DailyStrength.com but still feel alienated. This is my first adult year not working and it is weird. I can not get around well but I read mostly bios and other nonfiction, complete crossword puzzles and work-out on Lumosity.com. I generally sleep at least ten hours. I thought I could do something that would bring in some income but haven't gotten there yet. I used to write stories and poems but can't bring myself to doing that. My right hand is pretty useless. Dragon is not as easy as advertised. I'm very spiritual and pray, read the bible and follow mindfulness from Buddhist practices. I used to take photos, bike, salsa dance, hike and take long walks, all of which I can no longer do. My biggest challenge is to stop cursing so much when I can't do little thins like dress myself or cook. My hope is that more research is poured into stem cell research to end MS. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	I|began|noticing|numbness|in|my|fingertips|but|I|was|only|seeing|a|chiropractor|for|lower|back|pain|.|He|could|not|help|me|.|Then|a|new|chiropractor|could|not|give|me|a|decent|reason|why|I|could|not|walk|so|good|after|another|year|.|I|would|get|tired|after|a|few|blocks|.|I|mentioned|it|to|my|primary|care|doctor|and|she|had|me|take|tests|and|see|many|doctors|for|additional|symptoms|,|but|the|neurologist|could|explain|my|concerns|.|By|this|time|,|I|assumed|the|fatigue|had|to|do|with|menopause|although|my|walking|was|stilted|and|hard|.|Another|year|after|trying|different|chiropractors|,|the|one|who|cured|my|frozen|shoulders|tested|me|and|guessed|,|but|could|not|diagnose|.|He|instead|had|my|doctor|send|me|to|another|neurologist|who|gave|me|a|head|MRI|and|spent|time|explaining|my|new|diagnosis|.|I've|done|a|great|deal|of|reading|,|talking|to|others|with|MS|and|worrying|about|continued|employment|with|increasing|problems|.|I've|had|to|take|an|early|retirement|from|teaching|.|I|now|juice|almost|daily|for|energy|,|use|a|vibration|machine|for|exercise|,|started|a|gluten-free|diet|which|has|shown|an|increase|in|energy|and|cognition|;|I|somehow|just|found|this|site|even|though|I|read|the|newsletter|and|magazine|the|same|day|I|receive|it|.|I|keep|up|with|MS|sufferers|on|DailyStrength.com|but|still|feel|alienated|.|This|is|my|first|adult|year|not|working|and|it|is|weird|.|I|can|not|get|around|well|but|I|read|mostly|bios|and|other|nonfiction|,|complete|crossword|puzzles|and|work-out|on|Lumosity.com|.|I|generally|sleep|at|least|ten|hours|.|I|thought|I|could|do|something|that|would|bring|in|some|income|but|haven't|gotten|there|yet|.|I|used|to|write|stories|and|poems|but|can't|bring|myself|to|doing|that|.|My|right|hand|is|pretty|useless|.|Dragon|is|not|as|easy|as|advertised|.|I'm|very|spiritual|and|pray|,|read|the|bible|and|follow|mindfulness|from|Buddhist|practices|.|I|used|to|take|photos|,|bike|,|salsa|dance|,|hike|and|take|long|walks|,|all|of|which|I|can|no|longer|do|.|My|biggest|challenge|is|to|stop|cursing|so|much|when|I|can't|do|little|thins|like|dress|myself|or|cook|.|My|hope|is|that|more|research|is|poured|into|stem|cell|research|to|end|MS|.

The week before my 21st birthday I got my first attack. 4 MRI's, multiple blood tests, 1 urgent care visit, 1 ER visit and finally 1 Neruo visit: I got the diagnosis. I have non-progressive remitting MS. I guess you can say I was pissed. That was the only feeling I could feel for that moment. I paid no attention to the depression creeping up on me through out the months. Not only because I didn't understand why me, but the medicines were painful in every way. Not until I started to wonder around very dark areas in my mind did I thinm 1 visit a month to Therapy was my savior. My one year diagnosed MRI scan showed a good (big) size lesion on my C2 spine. Did I freak out? Did I swallow myself whole into a dark place? No. I worked myself around the first time, I knew I could do it again. I have faith and the support tools I need to overcome this. I can't tell anyone the right medicines for relief but from experience I know talking and expressing what you feel at the moment can help in seconds.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693250085383749068/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	My name is George from San Jose, CA. I was diagnosed with MS in late may after experiencing double vision, fatigue and dizziness ( had to cancel my Cancun vacation which was supposed to be the next week). I had always been a pretty healthy person, exercising at least 4 times a week and eating pretty healthy, so if course i never thought anything like this would ever happen. My biggest challenge so far is the mental aspect and anxiety that has been a burden on me. Id be lying if I said it wasn't a burden on me everyday. I feel like my mind is playing tricks on me..... waking up in the middle of the night with my hand numb when it turns out i was just sleeping on it (of course I had never done this before my diagnosis).......waking up every morning making sure my vision is fine and that im not numb anywhere. Just little things like that keep me on edge, maybe its because Im still pretty new to all of this but hopefully it will get better with time. Ive been on Tecfidera since middle of July so far so good minus the side effects for a few weeks, but still get the occasional flushing here and there.

There seems to be this common theme of hindsight vision that seems so clear among those with ms. In the moment my inability to wake up in the morning, uncontrollable sadness, and trouble concentrating in school seemed normal because I was a teenage girl and I refused to let anyone know about the suicidal thoughts that flooded my mind from time to time. Because there seemed to be no direct cause for my emotional turmoil I simply pushed it to the side. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	Although|I'm|a|lot|younger|than|most|people|diagnosed|with|multiple|sclerosis|;|now|that|I|think|about|it|...|my|story|doesn't|differ|much|from|everyone|else's|.|There|seems|to|be|this|common|theme|of|hindsight|vision|that|seems|so|clear|among|those|with|ms|.|In|the|moment|my|inability|to|wake|up|in|the|morning|,|uncontrollable|sadness|,|and|trouble|concentrating|in|school|seemed|normal|because|I|was|a|teenage|girl|and|I|refused|to|let|anyone|know|about|the|suicidal|thoughts|that|flooded|my|mind|from|time|to|time|.|Because|there|seemed|to|be|no|direct|cause|for|my|emotional|turmoil|I|simply|pushed|it|to|the|side|.

November of 2012 I started losing vision in my right eye. Turns out this was from optic neuritis caused by the MS. The Ophthalmologist is the one that sent me in for the brain MRI. From there it was off to a neurologist who sent me in for the spinal MRI. At that point I learned that I had multiple large lesions in my brain and all down my spine. I first tried Betaseron for a disease modifying injection. Turns out I have an allergy to Interferon products (my skin goes haywire). So now I am on daily Copaxone injections. I am also taking Gabapentin for neuro pain in my limbs and head. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	Following|my|symptoms|back|,|I|believe|that|MS|first|entered|into|my|life|in|1989|.|November|of|2012|I|started|losing|vision|in|my|right|eye|.|Turns|out|this|was|from|optic|neuritis|caused|by|the|MS|.|The|Ophthalmologist|is|the|one|that|sent|me|in|for|the|brain|MRI|.|From|there|it|was|off|to|a|neurologist|who|sent|me|in|for|the|spinal|MRI|.|At|that|point|I|learned|that|I|had|multiple|large|lesions|in|my|brain|and|all|down|my|spine|.|I|first|tried|Betaseron|for|a|disease|modifying|injection|.|Turns|out|I|have|an|allergy|to|Interferon|products|(|my|skin|goes|haywire|)|.|So|now|I|am|on|daily|Copaxone|injections|.|I|am|also|taking|Gabapentin|for|neuro|pain|in|my|limbs|and|head|.

About 2 years ago, I was diagnosed with MS after losing the ability to walk and having numbness traveling from my feet to my stomach in a matter of 36 hours. I was diagnosed in July 2012 with RRMS and was started on Copaxone. Unfortunately, as of recent, I have been having severe immediate post injection reactions, which just makes depression a lot worse. Therefore, in two weeks, I am starting Tecfidera (yay!). I am currently a pharmacy student and living with MS on top of a challenging curriculum can be difficult. I am trying to balance it all and take care of myself while finishing out my schooling. I hope to manage my disease as best as possible and to stay in remission as long as possible. I hope to do this a healthy lifestyle, a good diet, a lot of exercise, a ton of sleep and a good support system. Ultimately, I'd love to the MS Walk Challenge one day :). 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	Hi|there|!|About|2|years|ago|,|I|was|diagnosed|with|MS|after|losing|the|ability|to|walk|and|having|numbness|traveling|from|my|feet|to|my|stomach|in|a|matter|of|36|hours|.|I|was|diagnosed|in|July|2012|with|RRMS|and|was|started|on|Copaxone|.|Unfortunately|,|as|of|recent|,|I|have|been|having|severe|immediate|post|injection|reactions|,|which|just|makes|depression|a|lot|worse|.|Therefore|,|in|two|weeks|,|I|am|starting|Tecfidera|(|yay|!|)|.|I|am|currently|a|pharmacy|student|and|living|with|MS|on|top|of|a|challenging|curriculum|can|be|difficult|.|I|am|trying|to|balance|it|all|and|take|care|of|myself|while|finishing|out|my|schooling|.|I|hope|to|manage|my|disease|as|best|as|possible|and|to|stay|in|remission|as|long|as|possible|.|I|hope|to|do|this|a|healthy|lifestyle|,|a|good|diet|,|a|lot|of|exercise|,|a|ton|of|sleep|and|a|good|support|system|.|Ultimately|,|I'd|love|to|the|MS|Walk|Challenge|one|day|:)|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531969418564674/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	I was diagnosed with RRMS when I was 17 years old. My whole left side of my face was numb and I had sever balance problems causing me to fall to my left side. I spent 3 days in the hospital with no idea what was happening to me. I received a spinal tap, and numerous other amounts of testing. I was assigned a neurologist who was a complete joke. He gave me massive amounts of steroids, never actually told me if I had ms or not and eventually he stopped taking my calls. I went from 210 (at 6'2 i was in fairly good shape) all the way to 305 because of the high amounts of steroids. My grandma's friend whose daughter also has ms got me in to see her neurologist. I went to edward's neuroscience institute in Warrenville, Illinois to meet with Dr. Henry Echeverri. He immediately looked at my MRI and said I had active lesions and that he was mos certain I had multiple sclerosis. He had me continue high doses of steroids until I was able to start copaxone. I began copaxone and I absolutely hated the daily injections. The bumps and all the problems associated with the injections made my skin crawl, no pun intended. I was very depressed from the diagnoses and the weight gain and the shots were the icing on the cake. I spent a whole year isolating myself from my family and friends and drank heavily, even knowing how bad it was for my condition. I was still having a fair amount of relapses from the copaxone, partially in my opinion because I would miss doses. My doctor called me and said he wanted me to come in and speak with him. This terrified me, but I went in and met with him. He told me that the lesions were active and had gotten a little bit bigger. He suggested tysabri, which was the best decision I have made. I began tysabri and immediately looked up the medication and researched it from front to back. The side effects as well as the possible brain infection of PML made me hesitant but I accepted the risks. I started tysabri in 2014. I had such a good experience with tysabri. I went 3 and a half years without any relapses and the lesions I had actually began to shrink. This drug was a miracle to me. In January 2016 I had a calcaneal osteotomy on my right foot, because my feet are very flat and caused me agonizing pain when standing. Sure enough 5 months later I had a microdiscectomy (back surgery) on my l4-15. I was ready to commit suicide because the pain was the worst thing I have ever dealt with. I could not get the surgery until May due to me being on crutches from my foot surgery. After having the surgery I was given an unexpected reprieve. I had a whole new outlook on life. It made me realize that things can always be way worse and that my ms was always manageable. I began to work out when my surgeon gave me the okay and I was suggested a low carb diet by my uncle who lost 100 lbs in a year. I had tried many different diets and nothing worked so I figured I had nothing to lose. I lost 22 lbs in the first 2 weeks, and eventually maintained 3 lbs a week. exactly 1 year later i lose 87 lbs and went from 305 to 220. I was ecstatic by my progress and that my ms was in remission for so long. In august of 2017 I began dating my girlfriend who became such a big part of my life. She became a big support system of mine. She even motivated me to continue with my studies and get my degree since I can not work physical jobs anymore. Now in 2018 due to insurance change I had to see a new neurologist and lost my tysabri. It has been 3 months without it and I am starting to feel the effects of it. I will be switching over to gilenya. My current neurologist is a good doctor but getting a hold of him or his assistant is nearly impossible which makes things very complicated. The last 3 months have been a nightmare but I remain optimistic and have a great new job and I am exceeding in my studies. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	I|was|diagnosed|with|RRMS|when|I|was|17|years|old|.|My|whole|left|side|of|my|face|was|numb|and|I|had|sever|balance|problems|causing|me|to|fall|to|my|left|side|.|I|spent|3|days|in|the|hospital|with|no|idea|what|was|happening|to|me|.|I|received|a|spinal|tap|,|and|numerous|other|amounts|of|testing|.|I|was|assigned|a|neurologist|who|was|a|complete|joke|.|He|gave|me|massive|amounts|of|steroids|,|never|actually|told|me|if|I|had|ms|or|not|and|eventually|he|stopped|taking|my|calls|.|I|went|from|210|(|at|6|'|2|i|was|in|fairly|good|shape|)|all|the|way|to|305|because|of|the|high|amounts|of|steroids|.|My|grandma's|friend|whose|daughter|also|has|ms|got|me|in|to|see|her|neurologist|.|I|went|to|edward's|neuroscience|institute|in|Warrenville|,|Illinois|to|meet|with|Dr|.|Henry|Echeverri|.|He|immediately|looked|at|my|MRI|and|said|I|had|active|lesions|and|that|he|was|mos|certain|I|had|multiple|sclerosis|.|He|had|me|continue|high|doses|of|steroids|until|I|was|able|to|start|copaxone|.|I|began|copaxone|and|I|absolutely|hated|the|daily|injections|.|The|bumps|and|all|the|problems|associated|with|the|injections|made|my|skin|crawl|,|no|pun|intended|.|I|was|very|depressed|from|the|diagnoses|and|the|weight|gain|and|the|shots|were|the|icing|on|the|cake|.|I|spent|a|whole|year|isolating|myself|from|my|family|and|friends|and|drank|heavily|,|even|knowing|how|bad|it|was|for|my|condition|.|I|was|still|having|a|fair|amount|of|relapses|from|the|copaxone|,|partially|in|my|opinion|because|I|would|miss|doses|.|My|doctor|called|me|and|said|he|wanted|me|to|come|in|and|speak|with|him|.|This|terrified|me|,|but|I|went|in|and|met|with|him|.|He|told|me|that|the|lesions|were|active|and|had|gotten|a|little|bit|bigger|.|He|suggested|tysabri|,|which|was|the|best|decision|I|have|made|.|I|began|tysabri|and|immediately|looked|up|the|medication|and|researched|it|from|front|to|back|.|The|side|effects|as|well|as|the|possible|brain|infection|of|PML|made|me|hesitant|but|I|accepted|the|risks|.|I|started|tysabri|in|2014|.|I|had|such|a|good|experience|with|tysabri|.|I|went|3|and|a|half|years|without|any|relapses|and|the|lesions|I|had|actually|began|to|shrink|.|This|drug|was|a|miracle|to|me|.|In|January|2016|I|had|a|calcaneal|osteotomy|on|my|right|foot|,|because|my|feet|are|very|flat|and|caused|me|agonizing|pain|when|standing|.|Sure|enough|5|months|later|I|had|a|microdiscectomy|(|back|surgery|)|on|my|l4|-|15|.|I|was|ready|to|commit|suicide|because|the|pain|was|the|worst|thing|I|have|ever|dealt|with|.|I|could|not|get|the|surgery|until|May|due|to|me|being|on|crutches|from|my|foot|surgery|.|After|having|the|surgery|I|was|given|an|unexpected|reprieve|.|I|had|a|whole|new|outlook|on|life|.|It|made|me|realize|that|things|can|always|be|way|worse|and|that|my|ms|was|always|manageable|.|I|began|to|work|out|when|my|surgeon|gave|me|the|okay|and|I|was|suggested|a|low|carb|diet|by|my|uncle|who|lost|100|lbs|in|a|year|.|I|had|tried|many|different|diets|and|nothing|worked|so|I|figured|I|had|nothing|to|lose|.|I|lost|22|lbs|in|the|first|2|weeks|,|and|eventually|maintained|3|lbs|a|week|.|exactly|1|year|later|i|lose|87|lbs|and|went|from|305|to|220|.|I|was|ecstatic|by|my|progress|and|that|my|ms|was|in|remission|for|so|long|.|In|august|of|2017|I|began|dating|my|girlfriend|who|became|such|a|big|part|of|my|life|.|She|became|a|big|support|system|of|mine|.|She|even|motivated|me|to|continue|with|my|studies|and|get|my|degree|since|I|can|not|work|physical|jobs|anymore|.|Now|in|2018|due|to|insurance|change|I|had|to|see|a|new|neurologist|and|lost|my|tysabri|.|It|has|been|3|months|without|it|and|I|am|starting|to|feel|the|effects|of|it|.|I|will|be|switching|over|to|gilenya|.|My|current|neurologist|is|a|good|doctor|but|getting|a|hold|of|him|or|his|assistant|is|nearly|impossible|which|makes|things|very|complicated|.|The|last|3|months|have|been|a|nightmare|but|I|remain|optimistic|and|have|a|great|new|job|and|I|am|exceeding|in|my|studies|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693707179332816787/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	About six months after my daughter was born I started to get horrible headaches. Went to the ER got an MRI it came back normal, got a referral to see a neurologist. At the appointment with the neurologist he quickly decided (based off the MRI) that my headaches were caused by Occipital Neuralgia. (a condition which the nerves run up to the top of the spinal cord through the scalp called occipital nerves are inflamed). He gave me a nerve block shot and got sent on my way. Flash forward to 4 weeks later. I lost complete vision in my right eye along with numbness in my face. Went to the ER again, did another MRI. This time it came back with 5 lesions. I was rushed up to tge ICU and quickly hooked up to some steroids. I was told they wanted to keep me overnight and in the morning I would be meeting with a doctor. The next morning I met with the same neurologist that diagnosed me with occipital neuralgia. He explained to me that I had the symptoms of MS and they were going to do a spinal tap. A few hours later I had my spinal tap done and found out I wouldn't have my results for a while. My vision wasn't back to normal yet so I was stuck in the hospital for another 2 days. Two weeks (and two days before my daughter's first birthday) I was fully diagnosed with MS. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	About|six|months|after|my|daughter|was|born|I|started|to|get|horrible|headaches|.|Went|to|the|ER|got|an|MRI|it|came|back|normal|,|got|a|referral|to|see|a|neurologist|.|At|the|appointment|with|the|neurologist|he|quickly|decided|(|based|off|the|MRI|)|that|my|headaches|were|caused|by|Occipital|Neuralgia|.|(|a|condition|which|the|nerves|run|up|to|the|top|of|the|spinal|cord|through|the|scalp|called|occipital|nerves|are|inflamed|)|.|He|gave|me|a|nerve|block|shot|and|got|sent|on|my|way|.|Flash|forward|to|4|weeks|later|.|I|lost|complete|vision|in|my|right|eye|along|with|numbness|in|my|face|.|Went|to|the|ER|again|,|did|another|MRI|.|This|time|it|came|back|with|5|lesions|.|I|was|rushed|up|to|tge|ICU|and|quickly|hooked|up|to|some|steroids|.|I|was|told|they|wanted|to|keep|me|overnight|and|in|the|morning|I|would|be|meeting|with|a|doctor|.|The|next|morning|I|met|with|the|same|neurologist|that|diagnosed|me|with|occipital|neuralgia|.|He|explained|to|me|that|I|had|the|symptoms|of|MS|and|they|were|going|to|do|a|spinal|tap|.|A|few|hours|later|I|had|my|spinal|tap|done|and|found|out|I|wouldn't|have|my|results|for|a|while|.|My|vision|wasn't|back|to|normal|yet|so|I|was|stuck|in|the|hospital|for|another|2|days|.|Two|weeks|(|and|two|days|before|my|daughter's|first|birthday|)|I|was|fully|diagnosed|with|MS|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695734983088127253/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	My story goes back way before being diagnosed with MS. This is the same with many of you. Bear with me while I tell you a story of addiction first. I am a Respiratory Therapist and I worked nights for a long time. I started suffering from fatigue about 5 years ago. I assumed it was because of working the night shift. A co-worker gave me an Adderall and my life changed for good. I never felt so good. It was the most amazing feeling ever. I had so much energy. I no longer spent all my time in bed. I was on 20mg per day at that point. Then the fatigue started coming back so I went back to the doctor and she upped me to 25mg. That helped for a little while. I went back to my doctor for more. I was increased to 30mg. I was doing well for a few months. But the fatigue came back. So I went back to my doctor and was upped to 30mg twice a day. I was flying high! I got so much done. I was the go to guy at work! My patients loved me and the nurses were so impressed with my work ethic. But then the 60mg wasn't enough anymore. A co-worker of mine was also on Adderall and she would give me some of hers at times. Then instead of asking, I would take her keys, go out to her car and take more Adderall without her knowing. Obviously, this is a bad sign. But I went back to my doctor and asked for 90mg per day. She said no and that I needed to see a psychiatrist first. That was the beginning of the end. The psychiatrist showed me that I was addicted to Adderall. I already knew this but I was in denial. At that point, I was no longer on Adderall. It was a very tough 4 months without it. My wife helped me a great deal through the detox. After about 6 months, I was extremely frustrated with my fatigue. I changed to day shift and took lots of vitamins but nothing helped. I went back to my doctor and I was put on Concerta, which is Ritalin. It helped take the edge off. So a few months ago I started having extreme pain in my right ear. Like someone was sticking an ice pick through it. Two doctors saw no structural problems with my ear. I was referred to a neurologist. She ordered an MRI. I had a bunch of white spots indicating dead cells. I then had a lumbar puncture which confirmed the diagnoses. I had MS! I was happy to finally have a reason for the myriad of problems I'd been having for 5 years. Then I got depressed thinking about my future. As a Respiratory Therapist, I take care of a lot of MS patients. All I could think of was being in a wheel chair and unable to take care of myself. My wife, Toni, told me to snap out of it. And I've been trying to do just that. I've been reading as much as I can and formulating a plan. I just started Copaxone a couple of days ago. It hurts and really makes me itch at the injection site. But hopefully it'll work for me. My initial problem list was fatigue, erectile dysfunction, constipation, spasticity in my arms, depression and the pain in my ear.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692885890780445813/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	"I was diagnosed with MS in February 2011 while I was in graduate school for graphic design at Savannah College of Art and Design. Graduate school was stressful enough and my boyfriend and I had just gotten back from a tense holiday break where his family had fought a lot. I was diagnosed quickly, so quickly that I don't think I really got a chance to process what was going on very much at the time. I had a tingling sensation on my skin in the midsection and got diagnosed with a pinched nerve. The sensation quickly spread to my whole body (hands, feet, etc.) and because this happened on the weekend I got myself to the ER. That doctor suggested I see a neurologist because the spreading sensation had a chance of being MS. Our school doctor's office was able to get me an appointment with a neurologist right away, which I am very grateful for. He did tell me he ""really didn't think it was MS"" but we did the MRI anyways. Well, he was wrong! So much of the ""you look fine"" has been part of my experience from the very beginning. When I moved back home to MD I got a copy of my medical records and I could see that the doctor noted that my symptoms were likely caused by anxiety, so I've kind of felt unvalidated in a way from the start. Finishing school was pretty tough with this big rain cloud over me but I did it. I still wonder if I could have done better with my school projects and had a better portfolio if I didn't have MS. I am just now, 4 years later, processing at lot of this hurt, regret and emotions from my diagnosis period. I haven't had an MS attack since my initial diagnosis but have a hard time telling if symptoms I experience are from MS or from something else. I also have had thyroid problems and recently had my thyroid removed to diagnosis nodules that were growing on my thyroid (luckily it wasn't cancer but now, no more thyroid!) I feel like I get pretty tired and down easily and have a hard time picking myself back up. I worry about when things are going to take a turn for the worse and how I will deal with it.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694670587209007197/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	2012 The year I got married, my life changed so much I married my childhood sweetheart after a 9 years romance. He is truly my best friend and more than I could have ever imagined. We married in May. That December I woke up my arms and legs were completely dead / numb I thought this was strange and thought I may have slept funny, I did some exercises as I got ready for work, to try and get some movement back. The movement didn't come back and I remained numb for roughly a week. Cold was making it worse and I was beginning to lose my balance. I made an appointment with my GP who wasn't much help at first just said to go home and monitor it and if the numbness didn't subside to go back. Worried about the Christmas break approaching I booked back in. I was more firm this time as symptoms had got worse, numbness was making me lose my grip and my balance and coordination was really bad. He then wrote to the neurologist at the hospital and I was told to wait for an appointment to have some further tests. Months past and I still hadn't heard from the hospital, the numbness was coming and going at the stage and my knee was becoming inflamed and felt unsteady to walk on this was made me avoid wearing heels and going out in general. I also started to develop feelings of creepy crawlies under my skin mainly in my back also have shooting / electrical shocks randomly all over my body. I had no idea what this was but after spending a lot of time on Google I diagnosed myself I was 99% sure I had Multiple Scoliosis. The pain is unbearable at times. When my letter finally arrived it was March 2013 they tested my reflexes and my strength etc and said they were sending me for an MRI scan, the reality was starting to sink in and reading up was beginning to scare and upset me. My MRI scan was end of May 2013 the doctor was reluctant in confirming it was MS without doing a Lumbar Puncture. But he showed myself and my husband the scan of my brain and we saw lesions on my brain, which made my heart sink and my eyes welled up. The reality was sinking in I began to shake and wanted more answers the doctor was being very vague. My husband pushed him for answers. And he said in his professional experience it was Multiple Scoliosis but couldn't give us any further information as he want a specialist . And then we had to wait for a lumbar puncture. November 2013 came and I was called to go for the lumbar Puncture. The results look an age and again they confirmed I had RRMS. Finally after a full year I had the answer I already knew. I just don’t know why it took a whole year to get a diagnosis. March 2014 I started using Copaxone. I never ever thought I would be able to inject myself but I was dpoing it. I couldn't cope with the injections or the pain after or the damage it was causing to my body. But I forced myself to continue. In the end I just couldn't continue. The pain was too bad and I managed continue with Copaxone until I could started tecfidera BG12 in February 2015. So now I am 4 weeks in and will keep you all posted :) My biggest hopes and dreams regarding MS is that the firstly find a cure, in this day and age no one should be living with this illness. My Second hope is that everyone with this condition continues to fight it and keep the communication going because talking and educating yourself is so important. On this site we can all help each other. Spreading the word and sharing ideas and making new friends :) I plan to take part in MS walks and continue to spread awareness of this condition all over social media. I believe the lack of knowledge for conditions such as MS is frightening and I wish to educate people. (although I fear may bore people) lol. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	2012|The|year|I|got|married|,|my|life|changed|so|much|I|married|my|childhood|sweetheart|after|a|9|years|romance|.|He|is|truly|my|best|friend|and|more|than|I|could|have|ever|imagined|.|We|married|in|May|.|That|December|I|woke|up|my|arms|and|legs|were|completely|dead|/|numb|I|thought|this|was|strange|and|thought|I|may|have|slept|funny|,|I|did|some|exercises|as|I|got|ready|for|work|,|to|try|and|get|some|movement|back|.|The|movement|didn't|come|back|and|I|remained|numb|for|roughly|a|week|.|Cold|was|making|it|worse|and|I|was|beginning|to|lose|my|balance|.|I|made|an|appointment|with|my|GP|who|wasn't|much|help|at|first|just|said|to|go|home|and|monitor|it|and|if|the|numbness|didn't|subside|to|go|back|.|Worried|about|the|Christmas|break|approaching|I|booked|back|in|.|I|was|more|firm|this|time|as|symptoms|had|got|worse|,|numbness|was|making|me|lose|my|grip|and|my|balance|and|coordination|was|really|bad|.|He|then|wrote|to|the|neurologist|at|the|hospital|and|I|was|told|to|wait|for|an|appointment|to|have|some|further|tests|.|Months|past|and|I|still|hadn't|heard|from|the|hospital|,|the|numbness|was|coming|and|going|at|the|stage|and|my|knee|was|becoming|inflamed|and|felt|unsteady|to|walk|on|this|was|made|me|avoid|wearing|heels|and|going|out|in|general|.|I|also|started|to|develop|feelings|of|creepy|crawlies|under|my|skin|mainly|in|my|back|also|have|shooting|/|electrical|shocks|randomly|all|over|my|body|.|I|had|no|idea|what|this|was|but|after|spending|a|lot|of|time|on|Google|I|diagnosed|myself|I|was|99|%|sure|I|had|Multiple|Scoliosis|.|The|pain|is|unbearable|at|times|.|When|my|letter|finally|arrived|it|was|March|2013|they|tested|my|reflexes|and|my|strength|etc|and|said|they|were|sending|me|for|an|MRI|scan|,|the|reality|was|starting|to|sink|in|and|reading|up|was|beginning|to|scare|and|upset|me|.|My|MRI|scan|was|end|of|May|2013|the|doctor|was|reluctant|in|confirming|it|was|MS|without|doing|a|Lumbar|Puncture|.|But|he|showed|myself|and|my|husband|the|scan|of|my|brain|and|we|saw|lesions|on|my|brain|,|which|made|my|heart|sink|and|my|eyes|welled|up|.|The|reality|was|sinking|in|I|began|to|shake|and|wanted|more|answers|the|doctor|was|being|very|vague|.|My|husband|pushed|him|for|answers|.|And|he|said|in|his|professional|experience|it|was|Multiple|Scoliosis|but|couldn't|give|us|any|further|information|as|he|want|a|specialist|.|And|then|we|had|to|wait|for|a|lumbar|puncture|.|November|2013|came|and|I|was|called|to|go|for|the|lumbar|Puncture|.|The|results|look|an|age|and|again|they|confirmed|I|had|RRMS|.|Finally|after|a|full|year|I|had|the|answer|I|already|knew|.|I|just|don|’|t|know|why|it|took|a|whole|year|to|get|a|diagnosis|.|March|2014|I|started|using|Copaxone|.|I|never|ever|thought|I|would|be|able|to|inject|myself|but|I|was|dpoing|it|.|I|couldn't|cope|with|the|injections|or|the|pain|after|or|the|damage|it|was|causing|to|my|body|.|But|I|forced|myself|to|continue|.|In|the|end|I|just|couldn't|continue|.|The|pain|was|too|bad|and|I|managed|continue|with|Copaxone|until|I|could|started|tecfidera|BG12|in|February|2015|.|So|now|I|am|4|weeks|in|and|will|keep|you|all|posted|:)|My|biggest|hopes|and|dreams|regarding|MS|is|that|the|firstly|find|a|cure|,|in|this|day|and|age|no|one|should|be|living|with|this|illness|.|My|Second|hope|is|that|everyone|with|this|condition|continues|to|fight|it|and|keep|the|communication|going|because|talking|and|educating|yourself|is|so|important|.|On|this|site|we|can|all|help|each|other|.|Spreading|the|word|and|sharing|ideas|and|making|new|friends|:)|I|plan|to|take|part|in|MS|walks|and|continue|to|spread|awareness|of|this|condition|all|over|social|media|.|I|believe|the|lack|of|knowledge|for|conditions|such|as|MS|is|frightening|and|I|wish|to|educate|people|.|(|although|I|fear|may|bore|people|)|lol|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694311202092682332/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	It was the year 2001, I was in the middle of my divorce and this caused extra stress. With some pretty severe symptoms, I ended up in the hospital for 7 days. With some medication and rehab I was able to return home to pretty good physical function. But I new that there was underlying anxiety. I always knew that knowledge is power. I realized that I needed to get some much needed information about Multiple Sclerosis. I didn't know what this chronic condition was. I joined a peer support group and attended several MS seminars. I've use the internet as a tool, but I always watched which site that I've used to make sure that the site is a legitimate site. I've always tried to eat healthy and exercise. I prefer yoga and walking. Spending time outdoors with my dog is very important to me. I also think that meditation and relaxation techniques are very important for anxiety and stress reduction. I try and get a massage every month. This is something that I put into my budget. I feet that it's important for my health. I work part time and volunteer in my spare time. Having friends and family as support are also very important. You shouldn't feel like you have to go through life alone. People are in your life for a reason and it's okay to ask for help. I have a house of my own now and I'm finding that I have empowered myself to do more things ( ex. fix things, shovel snow ) just because I can. There are some good days and some bad days. If I have a good day, I'm going to take advantage of it.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693707254751941972/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	"So here's my story! Back in March 2018, I was hospitalized due to an episode of Optic Neuritis. I had been slowly losing my vision in my left eye which by the 12th day led me to the ER. I had no idea why this was happening and after doing an MRI of my brain with/without contrast, there were some lesions that were found on my brain. They ran some blood work and I had very low Vitamin D (amongst other things). This led them to do the lumbar puncture (Spinal Tap). The results from that came back positive for CSF glands (which is from what I understand damage to my Myelin sheath) with all of the contributing factors and what information the Neruo's had in the hospital, they said that there wasn't enough to diagnose me with MS, but to follow up with the reffered Neuro from the hospital and discuss further plans. Waiting 2 1/2 weeks to follow up with the NP was torture. I was laid up at home still not feeling my best while having the lingering thoughts of this being a disease that I may inevitably get diagnosed with and everyone just reminding me to stay positive. The appointment comes and I have all of my questions as well as a log of everything i've physically felt since being discharged from the hospital. The NP explains to me that based on the MRI, Positive LP, Low vitamin D and optic Neuritis that this will more than likely progress to an MS DX and that we should start on preventative medication. She went over the different types and the potential side effects and sent me off to get blood work to check my levels and said she will review ""my case"" with the director or Neurology and she will determine if she thinks Medication at this time was a good call but that she was 99% sure that thats what the Director will say. Then, I get a call from the NP a day after my appointment stating that she wants me to go get another MRI of my Thorastic Spine to check if there were lesions because this wasn't done in the hospital. I go and get the MRI of my spine and then have another follow up appointment scheduled for the following week. Now, in my mind- this woman has already led me to believe that this is a pretty sure thing and that we are going to set up a plan for treatment. She then calls me up and says that the MRI came back and there are no lesions- so you have a lesser chance of this progressing to MS and we are going to diagnose this as ""clinically isolated syndrome"". See you in 6 months for another MRI. So, naturally, i'm confused. How do you go from saying you're 99% sure we're going to treat this to see you in 6 months? In the next several months, I continue to communicate with this NP through their online portal and explain to her that i'm still feeling pretty bad such as fatigue, body weakness, body twitches and overall brain fog. She dismisses me time and time again. In June, 2018 I reach out again and insinst on getting another MRI. She agrees and also says she wants me to get more blood work done so I receive the authorization from my insruance but still hear nothing about scheduling the MRI. I follow up again and she said that the blood work ""isn't commercially available"" I said I don't know what that means and let another couple of weeks go by. Then, my eye starts to irritate me again and I reach out AGAIN following up on MRI/bloodwork and her response is ""go see your opthamologist."" This is when I said to myself- Enough is enough! Time for a second opinion. So, after a facebook referral post - I was referred to a Neuro in my area. I reached out and had an appointment the following week. I met with the PA and explained my entire history as well as how I was feeling currently. He agreed that an MRI would be most beneficial. So, within 3 days I had the MRI. Results are in and my appointment is the following week. Well, what do you know, NEW LESIONS are present on my brain. I called and spoke to the PA and he conferenced in the Neuro who reassured me that everything was going to be okay and that we would go over everything in our upcoming appointment and rescheduled me so that I could meet with him and his assistant to make me feel more at ease. Fast forward to present day and we are now moving in right direction towards Medication and physcial therapy and monitoring me every 6 weeks and actual SUPPORT from the doctor. Trust yourself and your body and don't settle when people dismiss you or make you feel invalidated. This may have resulted in an unfortunate diagnoses, but now I can try to get back in charge of my life.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531846600323894/Telling-Your-Kids-You-Have-Multiple-Sclerosis	Telling Your Kids You Have Multiple Sclerosis	"by Lorna J. Moorhead. Recently a mother asked me how I told my young son about my Multiple Sclerosis. "" How do you explain that some days you are always in bed or sick?"" She was very frustrated and upset. After being sick for a week now, her five-year-old son was really getting agitated and stressed. She needed help, but was not getting the answers she wished form her doctors. ""They all tell me that he is on a need to know basis, only tell him what he needs to know. I can't even begin to think of how to explain the complex workings of MS and the brain. I'm not sure he even knows what a brain is!"" when this email came flashing across my screen I sat back and smiled. I am not a doctor or a psychologist. I do not profess to know what will happen to my son's psyche because of the way I explained my disease to him. If someday I am called to rescue my son from a local hospital where they have him strapped up in a room yelling, ""KILL ALL WHITE CELLS!"" then I will admit defeat and shut my mouth. Until that happens, I will continue to give advice to mothers who after finding my website for moms with MS (MS Moms), send me frantic emails asking for some sliver of help. I recall how much help I received from my pediatrician when my son was a baby, ""Yep. That's a boy all right!"" And how much help I received from my friends, ""Put down the Brazelton and step away from the Dr. Spock! Good, now go to the neighborhood park, sit back and learn."" (Swimming pools, parks, grocery stores, these are the places to learn child rearing.). Therefore, after telling her to check up on my version of how I told my son on the web site, my next suggestion was as follows:. Ways to explain MS to your younger children:. The Brain:. First, draw Mr. Stick Figure. Make a big circle for the head. Draw a kidney bean or a peanut inside the head. That's the Mr. Stick's brain. Circle the brain showing that it is inside the head. Next, draw lines from the brain to different parts of the body, i.e., the hands, feet, legs. Now try to explain that the brain in Mr. Stick's head sends messages (orders) through those lines in the body. (At this point, my drawing looked like poor Mr. Stick had a run in with a jellyfish.). How do the nerves work? For explaining how the nerves transmit those messages, I used the idea of the phone. He didn't get it. Next, we moved on to his remote control car. I had him hold the controller and told him it was the brain. Then we attached some strings from his remote to the car itself to act as nerves. When my son moved the joystick one way or another, we talked about those messages (orders) went down the string to the car to tell it what to do. The strings were the nerves and the remote the brain. When the message doesn't go through. Next, we began to fray and cut some of the strings attached to the car. (While my son was in the bathroom, I took out one of the batteries to better explain my idea.) When he came back, he tried to get the ""brain"" to tell the body what to do. The car did not move. I explained that this is what happens when those nerves from the brain to the body get damaged. Another way to explain how the messages do not get through, is to take a long wrapping paper tube and talk through it to your son, then if you begin to cut the tube or break it, The sound changes and the message is not as clear. If he is interested in walkie-talkies, try changing the frequencies and noticing on which channel the message gets through the best, then switching channels and showing how the sound breaks up. (You can do this with TV channels as well.). Finally, when those messages don't get through, it causes your body to do funny things and makes you sick. Though it is a bit farfetched, you can tell your child that the ""be happy"" message is not getting through today. The same with the ""be awake"" message. How do the nerves get damaged? A basic way to explain what happens to the nerves and the myelin and to explain what each are, is by getting out an Oreo cookie. The myelin is the cookie outside and the nerves are the mushy white inside. If you chip at the cookie cover, the white (nerve) becomes exposed. Take the top off and drop the cookie on the ground, dirt gets all over the white filling and that shows how the nerve is not protected. Talk about how a dirty nerve might be bad at sending correct messages. Another way to do this is with a hotdog and hotdog bun. You can poke at the hotdog bun with a fork, and the hotdog is still okay, but if you remove the bun and the hotdog gets hurt. These ideas explain how the myelin protects the nerves. What is attacking the Myelin? Think of a TV show or movie that he loves, one that has definite bad guys and good guys (Try Ash, Misty and Broc against Team Rocket and Meowth from Pokemon). Try to explain MS by pitting the good guys (your medicine) against the bad guys (the raging white cells.) The bad guys want to destroy the nerve coatings and the good guys must stop them. Since explaining the white cells as misguided might prove too confusing for a younger child, just be blunt and make them bad guys. It's a simple concept that children can grasp and process quickly. In my case I never had to explain cells to my son at all, I just told him there was a battle going on in my body and he accepted it. (I wish adults were this easy to that easy to get along with.). If you do not take medicine for your MS, just explain that there are good guys and bad guys. Always assure your child that the bad guys are not winning. Remind your child that like in most of their favorite movies, bad guys never win. (Unless they're running for office.). If you do take some form of medicine for your MS, explain that the medicine is the good guys. When my son accidentally burst in while I was giving myself my nightly shot, I just calmly told him ""This is the way I shoot the good guys into my body so they can go attack the bad guys."" Being a typical boy, now he wants to watch every night as I take my shot so he can cheer on the good guys! (Mommy is having a hard time deciding whether it is appropriate for him or not. Then again what could be more frightening then the Teletubbies?). (Now for young children the bad guys don't have to be killed or attacked, just put in time outs, for eternity.). Remember the Basics:. 1. There is a battle going on in your body. (On the other hand, some cells are just being brats are not doing what they have been told to do.). 2. Nerves tell your body what to do and are protected by coats. (When he goes out during winter with a jacket on, he is protected from the cold the same way the myelin protects the nerves from damage.). 3. When the coat is damaged or removed, the nerve is exposed and the messages don't get through correctly. (When he takes off his jacket in cold winter weather, he can get too cold, or even sick, just as the nerves get hurt or irreparably damaged.). 4. You are not going to die. Your son may need to hear this a bunch! 5. The medicine you take (or if you don't take any explain you have good cells that are battling the confused cells), controls the bad guys what to do. Alternatively, it gets rid of the bad guys who are trying to take off the nerve coats. 6. There will be days when the bad guys seem to be winning. On those days Mommy or Daddy will not be feeling good. The best thing for your child to do is help you rest. Many children love to help and will be glad to be involved instead of banned from the room in which you are resting. © Lorna Moorhead.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4697507865652457735/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	When I was younger I experienced tingly hands on and off, and in 2007 after a camping trip, I suffered an episode of dizziness that lasted a whole week. Looking back, I really wonder when MS started in me. 2012 was the first time I believe I was affected by MS because I was closer to the affected age group. I went into work with double vision and ended up going to the E.R. because I thought something was seriously wrong, but they sent me home to sleep it off which took my stress away. In 2013 I had definite symptoms, although at the time I did not know it was MS. My step changed, I lost the ability to step smoothly, my feet just slapped to the floor, but I thought it was as a result of walking 19 miles a night for work. At the end of 2015, after a year and a half of driving a semi nationally and having numerous symptoms, I was struck with double vision which forced me to go to the doctor where they discovered lesions in my brain and I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	When|I|was|younger|I|experienced|tingly|hands|on|and|off|,|and|in|2007|after|a|camping|trip|,|I|suffered|an|episode|of|dizziness|that|lasted|a|whole|week|.|Looking|back|,|I|really|wonder|when|MS|started|in|me|.|2012|was|the|first|time|I|believe|I|was|affected|by|MS|because|I|was|closer|to|the|affected|age|group|.|I|went|into|work|with|double|vision|and|ended|up|going|to|the|E|.|R|.|because|I|thought|something|was|seriously|wrong|,|but|they|sent|me|home|to|sleep|it|off|which|took|my|stress|away|.|In|2013|I|had|definite|symptoms|,|although|at|the|time|I|did|not|know|it|was|MS|.|My|step|changed|,|I|lost|the|ability|to|step|smoothly|,|my|feet|just|slapped|to|the|floor|,|but|I|thought|it|was|as|a|result|of|walking|19|miles|a|night|for|work|.|At|the|end|of|2015|,|after|a|year|and|a|half|of|driving|a|semi|nationally|and|having|numerous|symptoms|,|I|was|struck|with|double|vision|which|forced|me|to|go|to|the|doctor|where|they|discovered|lesions|in|my|brain|and|I|was|diagnosed|with|Multiple|Sclerosis|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693250086504335362/Activity-Feed-:-MS-Connection	Activity Feed : MS Connection	My first instance with MS was just as I was starting 8th grade. Getting out of bed on the first day of school I noticed a little gray dot in my field of vision. Thinking maybe I had gotten something stuck in my eye. I went to ask my parents If there was indeed something in my eye. They didn't find anything so I went to school thinking maybe they were right . The next day when i got out of bed the little gray spot had doubled in size. I was frightened I told my parents that it had doubled. My mom called the optometrist. She said she wanted to see me ASAP. As all this happened the spot was doubling every day. I was entirely blind in my left eye by the next Monday. The optometrist sent me to The Moran Eye Center for an examination. They found that I had lost vision because of Optic Neuritis. The doctors there put me on a treatment for that. After about a month I lost equilibrium. At the same time I lost the ability to hear on my right side very suddenly. I was admitted to PCMC for more testing. By this time I had been tested for Lyme Disease, Lupus,and Mononucleosis as well as many others. After a Lumbar Puncture they found the culprit Multiple Sclerosis. Being only 14 it didn't make sense. I didn't really let it even start to sink in until my discharge when they told me I couldn't leave until I gave myself the first Avonex dose. It took me 30 minutes to give myself that first shot. It has been 15 years since then I have done a great many things never letting my MS get in the way. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|:|MS|Connection	My|first|instance|with|MS|was|just|as|I|was|starting|8th|grade|.|Getting|out|of|bed|on|the|first|day|of|school|I|noticed|a|little|gray|dot|in|my|field|of|vision|.|Thinking|maybe|I|had|gotten|something|stuck|in|my|eye|.|I|went|to|ask|my|parents|If|there|was|indeed|something|in|my|eye|.|They|didn't|find|anything|so|I|went|to|school|thinking|maybe|they|were|right|.|The|next|day|when|i|got|out|of|bed|the|little|gray|spot|had|doubled|in|size|.|I|was|frightened|I|told|my|parents|that|it|had|doubled|.|My|mom|called|the|optometrist|.|She|said|she|wanted|to|see|me|ASAP|.|As|all|this|happened|the|spot|was|doubling|every|day|.|I|was|entirely|blind|in|my|left|eye|by|the|next|Monday|.|The|optometrist|sent|me|to|The|Moran|Eye|Center|for|an|examination|.|They|found|that|I|had|lost|vision|because|of|Optic|Neuritis|.|The|doctors|there|put|me|on|a|treatment|for|that|.|After|about|a|month|I|lost|equilibrium|.|At|the|same|time|I|lost|the|ability|to|hear|on|my|right|side|very|suddenly|.|I|was|admitted|to|PCMC|for|more|testing|.|By|this|time|I|had|been|tested|for|Lyme|Disease|,|Lupus|,|and|Mononucleosis|as|well|as|many|others|.|After|a|Lumbar|Puncture|they|found|the|culprit|Multiple|Sclerosis|.|Being|only|14|it|didn't|make|sense|.|I|didn't|really|let|it|even|start|to|sink|in|until|my|discharge|when|they|told|me|I|couldn't|leave|until|I|gave|myself|the|first|Avonex|dose|.|It|took|me|30|minutes|to|give|myself|that|first|shot|.|It|has|been|15|years|since|then|I|have|done|a|great|many|things|never|letting|my|MS|get|in|the|way|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692885851425227656/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	One night in april 2016 I started having pain in my left eye everytime I looked up. It was the strangest feeling. It came on suddenly around 6pm. It was to late to do anything so i just left it alone figuring maybe i got clourine it it or something since I had been swimming that day. I woke up the next morning and my eye was blurry. It felt like I had a smudge on my glasses or a scratch on my eye. It was saturday so i sort of shrugged it off. By monday I figured i should het it checked out because it wasnt getting better. I went to the optometrist and they couldnt help me. Then I went to an optimologist who then thought maybe it was optic neuritis. They sent me to a specialty outpatient eye hospital in miami to get steroids. Got the steroids and on my way home I went. The next day my neurologist wanted to admit me to the hospital to do some tests. She had suspected ms but nothing proved it. When i got to the hospital i was admitted for a spinal tap. During the spinal tap I hear the nurse saying I was going to the icu. At this point im panicking thinking they paralized me with the needle in my back. Apparently my lactic acid levels were stupid high from all the steroids they gave me the day before at the eye hospital. After 4 days in icu, a negative spinal tap, nothing pointing to a positive diagnosis of ms. I go home. My vision eventually comes back and i move on with my life. Fast forward until September.

This experience has been a night mare and having some advice is so helpful. I am now experiencing serious vibrations in my hands and arms. My fingers on both sides are twitching uncontrollably. The twitches and vibes are fast and then slow. the rocking in my arm is so slight you cannot see it right off. I have been crying and suffering from extreme anxiety. My doctor put me on Propranolol which relaxes me but does nothing for these tremors. The tremors are at rest. My right thumb shakes when by my side. I am terrified that I have PD and it is progressing at an alarming rate. I am still feeling some vibes in my feet, legs just all over. It is better than before in my lower body and trunk but my hands are now showing scary tell tale signs. I also pointed out to her that my smile is a little off. one side of my face looks a little off to me. My family says they can't tell. My doctor took note of it but said it did not appear to the mask at all of PD. She did check my thyroid and told me that it was normal but high normal. it missed the too high by a few clicks. My doctor again reassured me that it is not PD, ALS, or MS for sure, although she is not sure what it is. I do not feel the vibes when my hands are moving but I feel them in my feet when I am standing on them sometimes. i am also experiencing sudden pain in my right hand and arm just above the wrist, and that arm is turning slightly on its on. I guess my thought is does this now sound like PD or more like Wilson's Disease. Trust me I would rather have nothing but if I have to chose I'll take the Wilson's. This is nerve wrecking. I am going to suggest to her that I may have late onset Wilson's Disease and beg her to send me to a MND Neuro. Oh, and my right side does seem to be a little stiff to me, and my insomnia is better but not gone.

Outcomes From a Pilot TrialSimon Tazzyman; Nicholas Richards; Andrew R Trueman; Amy L Evans; Vicky A Grant; Iveta Garaiova; Sue F Plummer; Elizabeth A Williams; Bernard M Corfe. BMJ Open Gastro. 2015;2(1) Abstract and Introduction. AbstractBackground: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated or implicated with the pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal conditions inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer, as well as with depression. No trials or epidemiology studies to date have investigated a link with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A single case report has suggested a benefit in IBS of vitamin D supplementation. We hypothesised that IBS participants with vitamin D insufficiency would benefit from repletion in terms of their IBS symptoms. We undertook a pilot trial to provide data to support a power calculation and to justify a full trial. Methods: This was a randomised, double blinded, three-arm parallel design trial of vitamin D, placebo or a combination of vitamin D and probiotics. Participants were further stratified according to whether they were vitamin D replete or insufficient. Vitamin D status was determined by blood test at baseline and exit; IBS symptoms were assessed by validated questionnaire; dietary intakes were assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Results: A significant proportion of the IBS population were vitamin D deficient, such that the replete stratum could not be adequately recruited. There was a significant association in the baseline data between circulating vitamin D level and quality of life (""How much has IBS affected your life?""). Supplementation significantly improved vitamin D level versus placebo. IBS symptoms were not significantly improved in this pilot, although a power calculation was enabled from the intervention data. Conclusions: The IBS population exhibits significant levels of vitamin D insufficiency and would benefit from screening and possible supplementation. The impact of IBS on quality of life may be reduced by vitamin D level. Future trials should have a sample size of over 97. IntroductionIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder which profoundly affects quality of life with a prevalence of 10–15% in the industrialised world.[1] IBS is a relapsing condition that has a large social impact and is associated with significant direct and indirect healthcare costs.[1] It is a heterogeneous disorder that can be subtyped depending on the bowel habits of patients; IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D) or IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M).[2]. IBS pathogenesis is poorly understood and it is generally regarded as a multifactorial disorder involving host and environmental factors, including diet. Most hypotheses involve altered intraluminal milieu, immune activation, enteric neuromuscular dysfunction and brain–gut axis dysregulation. It is thought that the intestinal microbiota might play an important role as bacterial infection, antibiotic use and chronic low-grade inflammation are associated with IBS onset.[3] Several studies have implicated changes in the colon microbiota may be associated with IBS symptoms, including perturbation in bile acid metabolism and electrolyte absorption.[4] This theory is further supported by generally beneficial effects of bacteriotherapeutic interventions (vide infra). Therapy for IBS is primarily targeted at treating the symptoms experienced, and include loperamide for diarrhoea, methylcellulose for constipation and smooth-muscle relaxants for abdominal pain.[2] Nonetheless, symptom treatment meets with limited success and may not be effective for long-term management of IBS. Mounting data suggest that probiotics may be beneficial in the management of IBS. A recent systematic review of 35 trials investigating probiotic use in IBS showed that 25 of these studies reported a beneficial effect on the primary outcomes including global symptom severity.[5,6] The effect on secondary outcomes varied between studies with improvements seen in flatulence and abdominal bloating following treatment with VSL#3.[7,8] Other studies demonstrated a decrease in abdominal pain after 4 weeks of treatment with Lactobacillus plantarum 299V when compared to control.[9] Our previous work has demonstrated an improvement in global symptom severity in people with IBS following 8 weeks of supplementation with LAB4 probiotic.[10]. We recently reported a case study of an IBS patient taking high dose (3000 IU daily) vitamin D. The participant reported remission of IBS symptoms following supplementation, with a recurrence of the symptoms on supplementation cessation. Additionally, analysis of social media (blogs/forums) reports from 37 IBS patients found that 70% described improvements in their symptoms with supplementation and the majority of these individuals reported being vitamin D deficient before supplementation.[11] A role for vitamin D supplementation in gastrointestinal health is also supported by studies showing associations between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).[12] A recent systematic review suggested there may be benefits of vitamin D supplementation in IBD.[13]. On the basis of our previous case report,[11] we hypothesised that patients with IBS who are vitamin D insufficient, would report improvement in symptoms following vitamin D supplementation. We further sought to test whether vitamin D supplementation in combination with a probiotic preparation would act synergistically. There are no published randomised controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in IBS and therefore no data on which to base a power calculation. A formal aim of this trial is to provide data to allow such calculations to be undertaken, enabling properly scaled clinical trials to be designed. Materials and Methods. ParticipantsEthical approval for this study was granted by The University of Sheffield Research Ethics Committee (Ref: SMBRER278). Participants were recruited via poster advertisements at the University of Sheffield. All participants had a previous clinical diagnosis of IBS and met the Rome III criteria at baseline.[14] Participants who reported any antibiotic use in the past 4 weeks prior to recruitment, recent changes in IBS medication, pregnancy, current use of vitamins or probiotic supplements, history of gastrointestinal surgery, diabetes or current use of antidepressants or antipsychotics were excluded. The study population was stratified by vitamin D status hypothesising that deficient or insufficient individuals would respond if deficiency were causal in IBS. Patient MeasuresThroughout the study participants were assessed using a number of outcomes. To assess vitamin D status participants provided a blood sample from which baseline and exit 25OHD was measured in serum. Participants were given a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) from which dietary intake was derived using FETA opensource software.i Baseline IBS symptom questionnaires were completed.[15] The questionnaire assessed abdominal pain (pain severity and number of days with pain), bloating, bowel habits (minimum and maximum bowel movement per day and satisfaction with bowel habit) and quality of life over each 2-week period. Study DesignThis was a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified study. Participants attended the Clinical Research Facility, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield for three visits (figure 1). At the first visit, baseline 25OHD was measured in serum, participants completed FFQ and baseline IBS symptom questionnaires were completed.[15]. Figure 1. Flow diagram of study protocol. IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; SSQ, Symptom Severity Questionnaires. The second visit took place approximately 2 weeks following visit 1. Participants were issued with a 12-week supply of supplement and were given IBS symptom questionnaires to be completed biweekly from the date of visit 2. At the final visit participants provided a second blood sample from which serum 25OHD was measured. Of the 51 patients issued with supplements 9 failed to return questionnaires for the full period (4 in the placebo group, 3 vitamin D alone and 2 combined intervention). Sample Size and RandomisationBased on our previous study[10] we aimed to recruit approximately 150 participants. By the end of the study 51 participants were recruited. Recruitment was between January 2014 and April 2014. Participants were stratified by baseline vitamin D statusii ('Vitamin D deficient' (25OHD &lt;20 ng/mL) and 'Vitamin D replete' (25OHD &gt;20 ng/mL)) and randomised. Participants were randomised to receive either double placebo (n=17), vitamin D supplementation and probiotic placebo (n=16) or probiotic and vitamin D supplementation (n=18). Participants were allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to the three arms of the study according to a computer-generated random sequence using block randomisation with a block-size of six. The randomisation was performed by an independent statistician. Participants were enrolled and assigned sequentially to placebo or active products. The allocation sequence was not available to any member of the research team until databases had been completed and locked. InterventionThe probiotic, vitamin D3 and corresponding placebos were provided by Cultech Ltd, Port Talbot, UK. Vitamin D3 and the corresponding placebo were provided as 15 mL liquid sublingual sprays. Both contained identical buffers with placebo lacking the active vitamin D3. Each spray of vitamin D3 gave a dose containing 3000 IU vitamin D3. The probiotic preparation contained two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, CUL60 (NCIMB 30157), CUL21 (NCIMB 30156), Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) at a total of 2.5×1010 colony forming units (cfu) per capsule. Volunteers were instructed to ingest one capsule per day with water and one spray orally per day for 12 weeks. Compliance was assessed by counting the number of capsules remaining and weighing sprays at the end of the intervention—98% compliance was achieved. Adverse EventsThere were no adverse events. One participant on the placebo arm reported feeling unwell after starting the trial with acute indigestion, heartburn and pain in the back which subsided after 2 weeks. The participant halted supplements for 4 weeks and then returned to the study under the initial time frame. Biochemical AssaySerum 25OHD was measured using the Cobas e411 automated immunoassay from Roche Diagnostics (Germany). The inter assay coefficient of variation (CV) was 4.6%. Statistical AnalysisNumber of days with pain were expressed as a percentage of each 14-day period. All other variables were assessed using a visual analogue scale and scored of 100. Individual scores were then combined to give a total symptom severity score of 500.[15] χ2 Test was used to assess the distribution of participants by vitamin D stratification. Associations between baseline 25OHD stratification (deficient: &lt;12.5 ng/mL; insufficient: 12.5–20 ng/mL; replete 20–50 ng/mL; toxic: &gt;50 ng/mL, no recordings were made at or near the toxic range) and baseline symptom scores, follow-up 25OHD and change in symptom score were determined by analysis of variance(ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction. Pearson's correlations for vitamin D intake and baseline serum 25OHD were undertaken. Change in symptom score over 7 time points were analysed by repeated measures ANOVA, missing data were not imputed and were assumed to be missing at random in the ANOVA model. Comparisons of deficient and replete symptom scores were assessed by independent t tests. All tests were two sided with a significance value of &lt;0.05. Analysis was carried out using SPSS V.22 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA). ihttp://www.srl.cam.ac.uk/epic/epicffq/iihttps://ods.od.nih. Baseline Vitamin D Status Shows a Significant Association With Quality of LifeDemographics of the population are shown in . The three arms were similar in terms of number, gender, age, IBS subtype and serum 25OHD. Overall IBS symptom severity at baseline (week-2) was similar between groups (243±67 placebo, 244±92 vitamin D and 237±67 vitamin D with probiotic, p=0.241) and between IBS subtype (figure 2A) as was the baseline serum 25OHD (15±8.4, 16±8.0, 14±8.3 ng/mL, p=0.295).

IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; FFQ, food frequency questionnaire. The majority of participants had baseline 25OHD levels that are considered insufficient/severely deficient[16] with an overall sample mean 25OHD of 15.3±7.9 ng/mL and 81.8% of IBS-C (n=7), 70% of IBS-D (n=9) and 81.6% of IBS-M (n=24) with &lt;20 ng/mL circulating 25OHD levels. This level of deficiency was similar to that seen in a BMI-matched cohort in Sheffield at this time of year (S. Bowles personal communication, 2014). There was no association between IBS-subtype and 25OHD status at baseline (figure 2B). However, participants with low 25OHD at baseline reported a greater impact on quality of life (on the basis of the IBS questionnaire) than their replete counterparts (p=0.034) (). There was no difference in other symptom scores between 25OHD deficient and replete individuals (). Data exploration suggested, a trend for lower affected quality of life scores in each IBS subtype in vitamin D replete participants against the non-replete cohort (see online supplementary, figure S1c http://bmjopengastro.bmj.com/doi/suppl/10.1136/bmjgast-2015-000052).

We sought to determine whether potential benefits of replete vitamin D status may be attributed to associations between systemic effects of 25OHD or the potential mucosal action of ingested dietary vitamin D. There was no association between vitamin D intake and symptom severity, suggesting the effect may be systemically mediated (figure 2C, D). Effect of Vitamin D InterventionThe distribution of participants by vitamin D status in each treatment arm was compared at baseline and exit. An equal distribution was seen at baseline () and the distribution was altered by 12 weeks of vitamin D supplementation. Of participants receiving supplementation in combination or alone the percentage of participants who were replete improved from 22.2% and 25.0% to 87.5% and 92.3%, respectively. Participants on placebo also had higher 25OHD levels with 60% of participants replete at exit compared to only 18.5% at baseline (figure 3A). Table 3. Vitamin D status at baseline and exit.

Box plot serum 25OHD concentrations (ng/mL) before and after intervention with placebo, vitamin D3 or vitamin D3+Probiotic. (deplete participants only), a significant increase in serum 25OHD was seen in all groups with a greater response associated with vitamin D supplementation alone or with probiotic when compared to placebo group (D). Repeated measure of total symptom severity against time point (deplete participants only). Participants who received vitamin D alone or in combination with probiotic had significantly higher 25OHD at follow-up compared to baseline (15.8±8.0 to 37.2±9.3 ng/mL and 14.9±8.4 to 37.1±11.7 ng/mL, respectively, p&lt;0.001). These two groups also had higher levels of 25OHD compared to the placebo group at exit with mean 25OHD levels of 37 ng/mL while the placebo group mean was 25.3±8.0 ng/mL (p=0.008 vitamin D, p=0.005 vitamin D+Probiotic, respectively) (figure 3A). While it appeared that there were improved scores in all reported symptoms from baseline to exit irrespective of the intervention arm, this was not statistically significant for any symptom tested. Additionally, treatment arm did not interact with any of the symptom scores at any of the time point (figure 3B and online supplementary figure S2 http://bmjopengastro.bmj.com/doi/suppl/10.1136/bmjgast-2015-000052). The analysis was repeated limited to participants who were deficient at baseline. A significant increase was seen between baseline and exit 25OHD in all arms (figure 3C) with no significant relationship of intervention arm on total symptom severity (figure 3D) or individual IBS scores (data not shown). DiscussionWe have presented evidence of high-vitamin D insufficiency in a population with IBS, We have previously reported anecdotal evidence suggesting a benefit of vitamin D in management of IBS.[11] Baseline data from our population would support a need for monitoring vitamin D status and suggests that the impact of vitamin D deficiency is most acute on perceived quality of life. A correlation indicated a potential relationship between 25OHD and quality of life scores; however, this did not reach significance. Reported quality of life will be influenced by the depression status of participants, a common comorbidity in IBS.[17] Numerous studies have reported that vitamin D levels are correlated with depression. In one such study vitamin D deficiency in young healthy individuals predicted clinical depression across a 4-week period, noting that as vitamin D levels increased due to seasonal difference in sunlight exposure volunteers showed lower levels of depression.[18] A similar pattern was seen in patients suffering post-stroke depression: lower serum vitamin D correlated with depression.[19] The exact mechanism through which vitamin D improves depression is not fully understood. However, vitamin D status has been implicated in neurological development,[14] the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed throughout the nervous system where its activation is linked to neurotransmitter levels and serotonin synthesis.[20] Additionally binding of 25OHD-VDR complex results in expression of 1-α-hydroxylase which converts 25OHD to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.[21] This 25OHD metabolite has been shown to upregulate neurotrophins which in turn promote survival and differentiation of nerve cells.[22] VDR is also expressed in the gut and regulates epithelial barrier function and bowel inflammation[23] suggesting that a vitamin D deficient diet may directly impact bowel function and hence IBS symptomology. Our attempt to distinguish the effects of circulating and ingested vitamin D did not support either model, likely due to underpowering. Supplementation with vitamin D increased serum 25OHD concentrations from baseline with a significantly greater improvement seen compared to participants receiving placebo. Nonetheless the group receiving placebo showed an improvement in 25OHD levels. This may have prevented us from detecting a significant difference in symptom scores between the placebo and supplemented groups at exit. This general increase in serum 25OHD across intervention arms was likely due to seasonal differences in sun exposure. It has been found in previous studies that the percentage of individuals in the UK deficient for vitamin D ranges from 30–40% (January–March) to 2–13% (July–September).[16] Study participants were recruited in the early months of 2014 (January–April) with most follow-up visits taking place from May to August, most likely explaining the rise in 25OHD in all groups. An exploratory analysis of participants by IBS subtype showed that there was a marked improvement in response to vitamin D supplementation across nearly all IBS symptoms in participants with IBS-C (see online supplementary figure S3 http://bmjopengastro.bmj.com/doi/suppl/10.1136/bmjgast-2015-000052). Interestingly the proportion of these participants that were considered severely deficient was low in comparison to the other IBS subtypes (figure 2B). A clear limitation is the very small numbers in groups when the data is split but the observation suggests a future study into vitamin D supplementation in this subgroup may be justified. Throughout this study we failed to observe a significant interaction with intervention with either vitamin D alone or in combination with probiotic. This is likely explained by a number of limitations in the study. First, we observed an effect of the placebo on symptom scores: IBS symptoms have a highly variable course (compare week-2 and 0 in figures 3B, D for example). It is recommended that active intervention in IBS last a minimum of 4 weeks and potentially up to 6 months for long-term analysis.[24] Furthermore, as a pilot study the current trial is inherently underpowered. In order to detect a statistically significant response in total symptom severity scores we would need larger sample sizes. With the data generated in this study it was calculated that a sample size of 74 per arm would be needed. This was calculated based on change in total symptom severity at exit with a placebo mean of −16, a mean of −54 for vitamin D intervention, a combined SD of 82 and assuming a desired power of 80% with an α error of 0.05. It is possible that seasonal variations in vitamin D levels may impact IBS in the current study. Our data show a general improvement in symptom score and improved 25OHD over the duration of this study is tempting to speculate that increased sunlight exposure increases vitamin D levels which in turn improved IBS symptoms. Such effects have been previously shown for IBS and IBD symptoms.[25,26] However, there was a significantly greater effect of vitamin D intervention than placebo on circulating vitamin D. Taken together, these data suggestion that seasonal variation should also be taken into account in the design of trials to assess the potential application of vitamin D in IBS. In summary we have shown that IBS sufferers deficient in vitamin D experience poorer quality of lives than their replete counterparts. Our data demonstrate the need for additional studies of more than 8 weeks in duration with recruitment of a larger cohort of IBS patients. Summary boxWhat is already known about this subject? Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that affects 10–15% of western populations, yet its pathogenesis and management are poorly characterised. Vitamin D supplementation has been associated with positive outcomes in other lower-GI conditions, including cancer prevention and colitis. Few studies to date have reported any relationship between vitamin D and IBS, although we recently reported a case study in this area. What are the new findings? The IBS population exhibits low concentrations of serum 25OHD; these levels respond to supplementation. There is a significant positive association between quality of life and circulating 25OHD concentrations. We provide data on which to inform power calculations for a larger clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation in IBS patients. How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? The data provide evidence for widespread vitamin D insufficiency in people with IBS. There may be benefit to testing IBS patients' vitamin D status and providing supplementation. There is a positive association between vitamin D status and quality of life measures, supporting a potential interaction between vitamin D and mental health and well-being. Clinicians may consider trialling vitamin D with patients with IBS as part of a nutritional management strategy. The results suggest a larger, adequately powered trial may be justified.

Fatigue that I could not explain away to people that thought I was just lazy, forgetting things. I was always a little bit... But I thought that I was relatively normal, until around twenty years old. When I was twenty, my symptoms progressed quickly. I fell a lot, blacked out a lot, amd had gaps in my memory. I am told that I fell down a flight of stairs at church one day, herniating a disk in my back, but I have no memory of this. I desperately looked for a diagnosis, a reason why I couldn't do things, but with no answers. Until I finally found a neurologist, who ordered an MRI. Who, after seeing the images, said that there were so many lesions that I should have been unnable to get out of bed, and told my mom that she needed to take me to a hospital, where they could run more tests, and where I was finally diagnosed with MS. I was only diagnosed the second week of July of 2018. I have been working with a specialist in MS, to get started on a medication ASAP. I already seem to have permanent nerve damage in my left side, and a lot of trouble speaking clearly. I don't know how to deal with it all yet, and am just trying to figure it out a little more, and try to male aome possitive connections in the MS community. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	I|was|sixteen|when|I|noticed|that|something|might|be|wrong|.|Fatigue|that|I|could|not|explain|away|to|people|that|thought|I|was|just|lazy|,|forgetting|things|.|I|was|always|a|little|bit|...|But|I|thought|that|I|was|relatively|normal|,|until|around|twenty|years|old|.|When|I|was|twenty|,|my|symptoms|progressed|quickly|.|I|fell|a|lot|,|blacked|out|a|lot|,|amd|had|gaps|in|my|memory|.|I|am|told|that|I|fell|down|a|flight|of|stairs|at|church|one|day|,|herniating|a|disk|in|my|back|,|but|I|have|no|memory|of|this|.|I|desperately|looked|for|a|diagnosis|,|a|reason|why|I|couldn't|do|things|,|but|with|no|answers|.|Until|I|finally|found|a|neurologist|,|who|ordered|an|MRI|.|Who|,|after|seeing|the|images|,|said|that|there|were|so|many|lesions|that|I|should|have|been|unnable|to|get|out|of|bed|,|and|told|my|mom|that|she|needed|to|take|me|to|a|hospital|,|where|they|could|run|more|tests|,|and|where|I|was|finally|diagnosed|with|MS|.|I|was|only|diagnosed|the|second|week|of|July|of|2018|.|I|have|been|working|with|a|specialist|in|MS|,|to|get|started|on|a|medication|ASAP|.|I|already|seem|to|have|permanent|nerve|damage|in|my|left|side|,|and|a|lot|of|trouble|speaking|clearly|.|I|don't|know|how|to|deal|with|it|all|yet|,|and|am|just|trying|to|figure|it|out|a|little|more|,|and|try|to|male|aome|possitive|connections|in|the|MS|community|.

Thanks for considering Wesley Smith's piece. In my continuing efforts to ""understand the universe around me,"" I've been reading _Everything Conceivable_ by Liza Mundy. It's thick, but fascinating. It should be required reading for all of us who dare talk about embryos! Incidently, the author is pro-choice regarding abortion. Gautam, you raise a good point. Apparently the way embryos are disposed of is up to the owners of those embryos. According to Ms. Mundy's book (pg 292-294), many clients can not make up their minds what to do, (some can't even bring themselves to talk about it), and that is why so many languish in frozen storage. Even the most liberal consumers of reproductive technology seem acutely aware that leftover embryos are not simply ""medical waste."" They are as hesitant to pass them on to other couples as they are to donate them for research. But yes, apparently some do bury them with ceremony. "	0	0	New|news|,|old|news|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715645245980309346/URSODIOL---A-Potential-New-Drug-for-PD	URSODIOL - A Potential New Drug for PD	"I have read the entire thread, and I commend you for continuing to inform others of a rx that has given you such dramatic relief. I recognize your results may be singular to you, yet, what I hear you say, is your desire to see if others would benefit also... and in doing so, anecdotal successes may evolve into ""evidence based"" solutions. Our greatest miracles of science all were born by serendipity at some point in time. Therefore, I understand your passionate diligence in wanting to make others aware of the success you have experienced. I wd personally message you ...but, one I don't know how, and two, since there is such an ""engaged"" discussion, I wd b very interested on others' opinions. I want to know if u have any opinion on MY non ""evidenced based"" discovery to reduce my tremors and gait problems.. and tell me if you think there is any correlation to your experience with Ursodiol. I will try to be succinct. What started me in the channel of dx of a neuro disease was a referral to a GI specialist in a well known esteemed medical facility. I have an active bowel, and watery yellow diarrhea daily regardless of diet. The GI dr did a full series of exams, but noted I had a tremor in my right hand. After asking me several questions, and reporting all exams negative, he referred me to the MS specialist. I was dx'd probable MS. But I developed significant tremors on my right side, and many other PD symptoms. I am 66 yrs old, dx'd 6 mos ago w/PD by a MDS, and prescribed generic carbidopa L dopa 50/200 4x per day. After hearing many anecdotal stories of coconut oil helping neuro chronic diseases, I researched the topic on line. I tried 2 tablespoons. At the risk of bringing on comments from skeptics, I cannot tell a lie. I felt improvement within minutes. I had the same experience with l dopa when ingested the first time. ""Evidence based "" medicine does not support immediate relief from neuro rx, but, in my case, observed by neuros, I did indeed have immediate relief from L Dopa, and the same with coconut oil. For doubters, I will add, other meds provide immediate relief as well, and, a cousin to L-dopa, heroin, has immediate impact on the brain. I, myself, cd not believe the effect coconut oil had on me, and thought it was pry psychosomatic. I abstained from the oil, symptoms returned. When I take the oil, they improve. (I am able to reduce my prescribed rx by 1/2 when I take the oil). However, what convinced me the oil had impact was the fact that when I take the oil, if I need to go to the bathroom from a sound sleep, I walk with little stiffness or rigidity. If I do not take the oil, I walk straight legged, stiff, and shuffle. I figure that rules out psychosomatic. So here is getting to my question, Fred.. As I understand the mechanism of coconut oil on the brain, is it is a different fatty compound than any other fat. It has the capacity to transcend the brain barrier when other fats do not. Cell death occurs when cells are denied fats. Theories are proposed that the coconut oil can actually renew cell growth in some people. PD occurs in people from diverse origins, and perhaps only a certain segment of PWP are impacted by this. Flash back to my original problem that sent me to neuros... and no one talks abt now cuz we are all consumed by PD...is the fact that my liver enzymes are always elevated.. but not high enough for invasive testing... I have watery, debilitating bright yellow diarrhea daily... for years...after reading your thread about Ursodiol being an rx for liver disease, yet off label controlling your tremors...my tremors responding to ldopa... but I hv negative DaT and MRI scans, and atypical labs for PD.....is it just me, or do you see a possible correlation between your combination of rx that remedied your tremors, and my experience with coconut oil augmenting my meds for tremor and rigidity????? Is there a common denominator in this mix? Fat absorption? Genetic propensity for blood brain barrier to oils? Fred, you and I are thinking outside the box to coin a popular saying to denote creative thinking in pursing concrete solutions. So, please, everyone, I KNOW this is not established medical protocol.... I am not suggesting in any form for anyone else to even try coconut oil, and I certainly am not selling the product. I find it fascinating, however, that Fred and I have both had an experience that affected our symptoms..changed the presence of PD... albeit some may argue, temporarily... and put another face on possible causes for the PD symptoms. Fred, I am eager to hear your response.... if you think I am on another planet right now, it is ok... cuz, like you, I cannot deny reality regardless if it fits established criteria or not. I know the improvement I have is real.... just want to understand it, and consider asking my neuro abt Ursodiol.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531988174089272/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	I started frequently experiencing terrible migraines in late 2012. I dealt with them for a few months and finally went to my primary care doctor. After a few visits with her I asked if I could see a neurologist. She gave me a referral and then I had to play the waiting game before I could get an appointment. My neurologist did some tests and didn't seem too concerned, but asked if I wanted to have an MRI to rule out tumors. Finally had an MRI and the results came back with several lesions on my brain. I was shocked. My neurologist asked me if I had ever had trauma to the head or any bad infections in my life. I said no and he decided to have me get a lumbar puncture. When I had my lumbar puncture, it was very uncomfortable. Laying there on my stomach while I knew a huge needle was going into my back was very scary. I did not like that experience! The next day I felt pretty good. Did some walking around and later that evening started feeling sick and had a bad headache. Could not be out of bed very long. Went to sleep and the next morning was horrible. Had to go to the ER. Had a spinal headache and had to have a blood patch done. Felt a little better and they decided to let me go. As I sat up and was getting dressed and shoes on, I threw up. I knew something wasn't right and told them but they let me go. The rest of the night at home was terrible, I was getting sick and could not get out of bed. The next morning I went right back to the ER again and was given a second blood patch. This time it worked great and I was so much better. That was a scary time. The results took forever to make their way to my doctor. After a long wait my neurologist called me and told me that the lab that was testing my spinal fluid did not test the third vial of fluid by the day they were supposed to and that the fluid had gone bad. They were supposed to test three vials of fluid but only did two. My neurologist and his staff were not happy at all. So this made me very frustrated and scared, because I was told that normally if two of the tests came back abnormal, there's a good chance it's MS. With the results we did have, which included the presence of Oligoclonal bands in my spinal fluid, my neurologist referred me to an MS specialist. When I first saw the MS doctor, he was not concerned that the third spinal fluid test wasn't done. He decided to have me go and have my blood drawn for about 9 or so things to rule them out. One of those was lyme disease. That was the main thing my doctor thought it could be other than MS. Since that came back negative, as well as everything else (except a slight vitamin D deficiency), he has diagnosed me with MS. He wanted to start me on a medication but I don't seem to react well to new medications so I am scared. He told me we can wait until March 2014 and I can do another MRI to see if there are new lesions. Then discuss medications to start then. The main thing that is hard for me are the migraines. I usually get them several times a week, but sometimes go 2 or even 3 weeks occasionally without having one. I have two young children and want another. I never thought I'd have to question whether or not I really should have another child (or do many other things I want to) because of MS. But even though I am still newly diagnosed and still need to learn more about MS, I am trying to not let it scare me away from things I would do if I was not diagnosed. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	I|started|frequently|experiencing|terrible|migraines|in|late|2012|.|I|dealt|with|them|for|a|few|months|and|finally|went|to|my|primary|care|doctor|.|After|a|few|visits|with|her|I|asked|if|I|could|see|a|neurologist|.|She|gave|me|a|referral|and|then|I|had|to|play|the|waiting|game|before|I|could|get|an|appointment|.|My|neurologist|did|some|tests|and|didn't|seem|too|concerned|,|but|asked|if|I|wanted|to|have|an|MRI|to|rule|out|tumors|.|Finally|had|an|MRI|and|the|results|came|back|with|several|lesions|on|my|brain|.|I|was|shocked|.|My|neurologist|asked|me|if|I|had|ever|had|trauma|to|the|head|or|any|bad|infections|in|my|life|.|I|said|no|and|he|decided|to|have|me|get|a|lumbar|puncture|.|When|I|had|my|lumbar|puncture|,|it|was|very|uncomfortable|.|Laying|there|on|my|stomach|while|I|knew|a|huge|needle|was|going|into|my|back|was|very|scary|.|I|did|not|like|that|experience|!|The|next|day|I|felt|pretty|good|.|Did|some|walking|around|and|later|that|evening|started|feeling|sick|and|had|a|bad|headache|.|Could|not|be|out|of|bed|very|long|.|Went|to|sleep|and|the|next|morning|was|horrible|.|Had|to|go|to|the|ER|.|Had|a|spinal|headache|and|had|to|have|a|blood|patch|done|.|Felt|a|little|better|and|they|decided|to|let|me|go|.|As|I|sat|up|and|was|getting|dressed|and|shoes|on|,|I|threw|up|.|I|knew|something|wasn't|right|and|told|them|but|they|let|me|go|.|The|rest|of|the|night|at|home|was|terrible|,|I|was|getting|sick|and|could|not|get|out|of|bed|.|The|next|morning|I|went|right|back|to|the|ER|again|and|was|given|a|second|blood|patch|.|This|time|it|worked|great|and|I|was|so|much|better|.|That|was|a|scary|time|.|The|results|took|forever|to|make|their|way|to|my|doctor|.|After|a|long|wait|my|neurologist|called|me|and|told|me|that|the|lab|that|was|testing|my|spinal|fluid|did|not|test|the|third|vial|of|fluid|by|the|day|they|were|supposed|to|and|that|the|fluid|had|gone|bad|.|They|were|supposed|to|test|three|vials|of|fluid|but|only|did|two|.|My|neurologist|and|his|staff|were|not|happy|at|all|.|So|this|made|me|very|frustrated|and|scared|,|because|I|was|told|that|normally|if|two|of|the|tests|came|back|abnormal|,|there's|a|good|chance|it's|MS|.|With|the|results|we|did|have|,|which|included|the|presence|of|Oligoclonal|bands|in|my|spinal|fluid|,|my|neurologist|referred|me|to|an|MS|specialist|.|When|I|first|saw|the|MS|doctor|,|he|was|not|concerned|that|the|third|spinal|fluid|test|wasn't|done|.|He|decided|to|have|me|go|and|have|my|blood|drawn|for|about|9|or|so|things|to|rule|them|out|.|One|of|those|was|lyme|disease|.|That|was|the|main|thing|my|doctor|thought|it|could|be|other|than|MS|.|Since|that|came|back|negative|,|as|well|as|everything|else|(|except|a|slight|vitamin|D|deficiency|)|,|he|has|diagnosed|me|with|MS|.|He|wanted|to|start|me|on|a|medication|but|I|don't|seem|to|react|well|to|new|medications|so|I|am|scared|.|He|told|me|we|can|wait|until|March|2014|and|I|can|do|another|MRI|to|see|if|there|are|new|lesions|.|Then|discuss|medications|to|start|then|.|The|main|thing|that|is|hard|for|me|are|the|migraines|.|I|usually|get|them|several|times|a|week|,|but|sometimes|go|2|or|even|3|weeks|occasionally|without|having|one|.|I|have|two|young|children|and|want|another|.|I|never|thought|I'd|have|to|question|whether|or|not|I|really|should|have|another|child|(|or|do|many|other|things|I|want|to|)|because|of|MS|.|But|even|though|I|am|still|newly|diagnosed|and|still|need|to|learn|more|about|MS|,|I|am|trying|to|not|let|it|scare|me|away|from|things|I|would|do|if|I|was|not|diagnosed|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715897916707382620/Study:-Urban-African-Americans-more-likely-to-live-in-trauma-deserts	Study: Urban African-Americans more likely to live in trauma deserts	"African-Americans in major U.S. cities are significantly more likely to live in ""trauma deserts"" with limited access to advanced emergency medical care, according to new research from the University of Chicago Medicine. The study also shows the academic medical center's new Level 1 Trauma Center led to a seven-fold reduction in Chicago's access disparity. The findings, published March 8 in the Journal of the American Medical Association's Network Open , are the first to be released about the impact of UChicago Medicine's adult Level 1 Trauma Center. Adult trauma services at the hospital began in May 2018. ""So much of the advocacy for the trauma center was framed in terms of racial equity,"" said Elizabeth Tung, MD, MS, a primary care physician and instructor of medicine at UChicago Medicine who was the paper's first author. ""But we realized no previous studies had addressed trauma access through the lens of race/ethnicity - not just looking at Chicago, but comparing our city to other communities as well."" The research team examined access to trauma care in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles using a geospatial analysis that compared the location of designated trauma centers with the racial and ethnic composition of the cities' census tracts. The project included only Level 1 and Level 2 Trauma Centers, which are able to provide medical care to patients with the most serious injuries. Using a standard established in previous research from colleagues at other hospitals, the team defined a ""trauma desert"" as any urban community that is at least five miles away from advanced trauma care. While many suburban and rural communities are significantly further away from trauma care, Tung said dense urban communities must be assessed differently. ""Five miles in a rural area is probably five minutes away, but in an urban area that same distance could be 15 minutes or it could be two hours away - it entirely depends on traffic congestion,"" Tung said. ""The kind of care in urban trauma also differs from that in rural areas - the types of trauma are generally different, the patient volume is higher and the injuries are more severe."" Trauma centers provided advanced emergency medical care for patients with critical injuries, including those from motor vehicle accidents, falls, shootings and stabbings. In Chicago, the team found that 73 percent of census tracts with a mostly black population were located in trauma deserts. Until UChicago Medicine's trauma center opened 10 months ago on its Hyde Park medical campus, residents of those communities had 8.5 times higher odds of being farther away from trauma care than people living in the city's white-majority census tracts. The new trauma center reduced this disparity by nearly 7-fold, to 1.6 times. ""Since we opened the trauma center nearly one year ago in May, the disparity in access to adult trauma care has been significantly lessened for African-Americans in Chicago,"" said Selwyn Rogers, Jr., MD, MPH, a professor of surgery and the director of UChicago Medicine's trauma center, which has treated more than 2,000 trauma patients. In New York City, just 14 percent of African-American communities were located in trauma deserts. In Los Angeles, 89 percent of African-American communities were located in trauma deserts, although very few census tracts in Los Angeles remain predominantly African-American. The team said Chicago's Hispanic and Latino communities were also more likely to be farther from trauma care than those living in white communities. The Hispanic and Latino disparity was not present in New York or Los Angeles. ""Even though we had a sense that this was a racially divided issue, the data confirmed that this was the case in a significant way. It was pretty startling,"" said Monica Peek, MD, MPH, an associate professor of medicine and health disparities researcher who was the senior author on the paper. UChicago Medicine has provided pediatric trauma care at Comer Children's Hospital since 1990, but previously ended its adult trauma program in 1988 before announcing it would resume the service in 2015 in response to community requests. The hospital built a new adult emergency department, which opened in late December 2017. Adult trauma services launched about five months later, following regulatory approval. The researchers said they hope their findings highlight the lingering impact of structural inequality in U.S. cities. They said planning for new trauma centers, which require a significant financial investment, should include an assessment of how a new facility can help address racial equity. The study, Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Geographic Access to Trauma Care: A Multiple Methods Study of U.S. Urban Trauma Centers, was supported by a grant (5K12HS023007) from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Hi livinglifejoy,. While I can't advise you on how to treat the restless legs, I thought you may be interested in this article about MS and restless leg syndrome:. Restless legs and other sleep disorders. Jess, MS Navigator. Mar 10, 2019 1:35 PM. Mar 10, 2019 5:14 PM. Thanks for sharing your post. I have quite a bit a stiffness and tinglisnh in my arms/legs. When it gets real bad, I feel burning in my feet. Early on, after my DX in April of 2017 I would get these crazy electric surges in my legs that were just awful. I did a few things that were super helpful (lots of trial and error). 1. I take baclofen during the day and gabapentin and baclofen at night before bed. 2. I found a great physical therapist that helped me with some simple daily things to do. Simple stretches and rolling ice bottles on my feet when it gets bad have been huge for me. 3. I notice when I sit too much, my symptoms worsen so I try and walk a lot. It’s not easy because the fatigue kicks in. It’s a balance and a struggle but I’m just gonna keep trying. I wish it was easier and I’m sorry for your struggles. This stuff is no fun but it always helps me to know we aren’t but alone. I’ll be cheering for you! 	0	0	Discussions|-|MS|Connection	Mar|08|,|2019|6:25|AM|.|Any|experience|with|RLS|and|tight|leg|muscles|?|*|.|Mar|08|,|2019|2:29|PM|.|Hi|livinglifejoy|,|.|While|I|can't|advise|you|on|how|to|treat|the|restless|legs|,|I|thought|you|may|be|interested|in|this|article|about|MS|and|restless|leg|syndrome|:|.|Restless|legs|and|other|sleep|disorders|.|Jess|,|MS|Navigator|.|Mar|10|,|2019|1:35|PM|.|Mar|10|,|2019|5:14|PM|.|Thanks|for|sharing|your|post|.|I|have|quite|a|bit|a|stiffness|and|tinglisnh|in|my|arms|/|legs|.|When|it|gets|real|bad|,|I|feel|burning|in|my|feet|.|Early|on|,|after|my|DX|in|April|of|2017|I|would|get|these|crazy|electric|surges|in|my|legs|that|were|just|awful|.|I|did|a|few|things|that|were|super|helpful|(|lots|of|trial|and|error|)|.|1|.|I|take|baclofen|during|the|day|and|gabapentin|and|baclofen|at|night|before|bed|.|2|.|I|found|a|great|physical|therapist|that|helped|me|with|some|simple|daily|things|to|do|.|Simple|stretches|and|rolling|ice|bottles|on|my|feet|when|it|gets|bad|have|been|huge|for|me|.|3|.|I|notice|when|I|sit|too|much|,|my|symptoms|worsen|so|I|try|and|walk|a|lot|.|It|’|s|not|easy|because|the|fatigue|kicks|in|.|It|’|s|a|balance|and|a|struggle|but|I|’|m|just|gonna|keep|trying|.|I|wish|it|was|easier|and|I|’|m|sorry|for|your|struggles|.|This|stuff|is|no|fun|but|it|always|helps|me|to|know|we|aren|’|t|but|alone|.|I|’|ll|be|cheering|for|you|!

St. Lidwina of Schiedam (1380-1433). Possibly the earliest known descriptions of a case of Multiple Sclerosis referred to the woman depicted in this woodcut, St. Lidwina of Schiedam. Lidwina lived in 14th century Holland and historical texts reveal that she was afflicted with a debilitating disease, sharing many characteristics with MS. St Lidwina’s disease began soon after a fall while skating, at the age of 16. From that time onwards, she developed walking difficulties, headaches and violent pains in her teeth. By the age of 19, both her legs were paralysed and her vision was disturbed. Over the next 34 years, Lidwina's condition slowly deteriorated, although with apparent periods of remission, until eventually she died at the age of 53. St Lidwina's symptoms were consistent with those of MS, as were the age of onset, duration and course of disease. Together these factors suggest that a posthumous diagnosis of MS may be plausible, therefore dating MS back to the 14th century. ==> Sir Augustus d'Esté (1794-1848). 	1	1	MS|Ireland|::|St|.|Lidwina|of|Schiedam	MS|Ireland|::|.|St|.|Lidwina|of|Schiedam|.|St|.|Lidwina|of|Schiedam|(|1380-1433|)|.|Possibly|the|earliest|known|descriptions|of|a|case|of|Multiple|Sclerosis|referred|to|the|woman|depicted|in|this|woodcut|,|St|.|Lidwina|of|Schiedam|.|Lidwina|lived|in|14th|century|Holland|and|historical|texts|reveal|that|she|was|afflicted|with|a|debilitating|disease|,|sharing|many|characteristics|with|MS|.|St|Lidwina|’|s|disease|began|soon|after|a|fall|while|skating|,|at|the|age|of|16|.|From|that|time|onwards|,|she|developed|walking|difficulties|,|headaches|and|violent|pains|in|her|teeth|.|By|the|age|of|19|,|both|her|legs|were|paralysed|and|her|vision|was|disturbed|.|Over|the|next|34|years|,|Lidwina's|condition|slowly|deteriorated|,|although|with|apparent|periods|of|remission|,|until|eventually|she|died|at|the|age|of|53|.|St|Lidwina's|symptoms|were|consistent|with|those|of|MS|,|as|were|the|age|of|onset|,|duration|and|course|of|disease|.|Together|these|factors|suggest|that|a|posthumous|diagnosis|of|MS|may|be|plausible|,|therefore|dating|MS|back|to|the|14th|century|.|=|=|>|Sir|Augustus|d'Esté|(|1794-1848|)|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531494807803761/MS-Ireland--::-John-W-Prineas	MS Ireland  :: John W Prineas	MS Ireland  ::. John W Prineas. John W Prineas (1937-present). By the middle of this century, a great deal was known about the pathological changes that occur in MS, and the clinical effects of those changes, but the underlying mechanisms leading to tissue pathology were poorly understood, although an immunological role had been confirmed. During the 1970s and 1980s, John. Prineas of New Jersey, USA used specialised light and electron microscopy techniques to examine the detailed histology of MS lesions, providing clues about their pathogenesis ( 16 ). The slide shows one of Prineas's electron microscopy images showing a microglial cell (arrow) and macrophage in the vicinity of demyelinating axons ( 16 ). It had already been shown that MS lesions contain lymphocytes and plasma cells, suggesting the existence of a local immune response to an unknown antigen, but Prineas's observations led him to conclude that both macrophages and microglial cells are required for the digestion of myelin. Prineas's studies also suggest that within chronic lesions there is a continued expression and processing of antigen in the absence of fresh lesion formation ( 16 ). ==> Ian R Young (1932-present). 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|John|W|Prineas	MS|Ireland|::|.|John|W|Prineas|.|John|W|Prineas|(|1937|-|present|)|.|By|the|middle|of|this|century|,|a|great|deal|was|known|about|the|pathological|changes|that|occur|in|MS|,|and|the|clinical|effects|of|those|changes|,|but|the|underlying|mechanisms|leading|to|tissue|pathology|were|poorly|understood|,|although|an|immunological|role|had|been|confirmed|.|During|the|1970s|and|1980s|,|John|.|Prineas|of|New|Jersey|,|USA|used|specialised|light|and|electron|microscopy|techniques|to|examine|the|detailed|histology|of|MS|lesions|,|providing|clues|about|their|pathogenesis|(|16|)|.|The|slide|shows|one|of|Prineas's|electron|microscopy|images|showing|a|microglial|cell|(|arrow|)|and|macrophage|in|the|vicinity|of|demyelinating|axons|(|16|)|.|It|had|already|been|shown|that|MS|lesions|contain|lymphocytes|and|plasma|cells|,|suggesting|the|existence|of|a|local|immune|response|to|an|unknown|antigen|,|but|Prineas's|observations|led|him|to|conclude|that|both|macrophages|and|microglial|cells|are|required|for|the|digestion|of|myelin|.|Prineas's|studies|also|suggest|that|within|chronic|lesions|there|is|a|continued|expression|and|processing|of|antigen|in|the|absence|of|fresh|lesion|formation|(|16|)|.|=|=|>|Ian|R|Young|(|1932|-|present|)|.

Mr. Eugene Kearney. I have Multiple Sclerosis, as did my father and one of my cousins. I was diagnosed in 1990 at the age of 34. I cannot overstate how valuable the services provided by MS Ireland, particularly by the Louth Branch and NE Region, have been to me and the many others who live each day with MS. These are services which must not only be protected but expanded. My qualifications are in Industrial Engineering, Industrial Relations and Personnel Management. Following some years in Management Consultancy, I worked for 35 years with SIPTU, initially providing a technical perspective on issues which arose in all types of employment situations and had a national brief. As MS affected my mobility I worked as a Financial Analyst and Researcher and am now retired. I have also lectured at Third Level. I have served as Board Member, Chair and Secretary of a number of NGO's over the years. My professional and personal experiences allow me to offer a different and very necessary perspective to the work of the Society. I am married with one daughter and live in County Louth.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531963498624748/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	"In 2007, I was an unsuspecting thirteen-year-old girl moving from homeschool to public high school. Little did I know my life was going to be more complicated than I ever imagined. During my years in high school, I was a varsity swimmer on a small team. I loved every minute of it. But I failed to realize the toll MS was taking on my life. After a two-hour practice, I would arrive home and attempt to do homework - to no avail. I would fall asleep writing, eating, and even talking. My parents would come over to me and wake me up so I could finish my assignments. This was a common occurrence throughout my four years at McNair Academic High School. Weekends during swimming seasons were spent in hibernation. Friday nights I would sleep up to 14 hours straight, trying to recover from the irreconcilable fatigue. I still had no inclination of my impending diagnosis. During high school, I was diagnosed with mono at least twice; so severely that I could not swim. My spleen was so swollen diving posed a threat to its integrity. Even still, there was no hint of MS. Outside of this, high school was a parade of sick days, with yearly installments of bronchitis, sinusitis, cases of stomach flu, and mono. I was just one of those kids that was always sick. 2011 brought graduation and college. I got a job as an assistant physical therapist, which I kept for about 2 years and few odd months. During that time, I was able to learn much about muscles, neurology, and how to rehab based on what the ailment was. As those two years passed, red flags came and went, with no diagnosis. My left hip had ghost pain for a few weeks, I needed glasses and suddenly didn't need them anymore. In 2012, I got into a car accident. Both parties walked away with no severe injuries. The day of the accident, I continued to work after filing a police report. The accident was only a financial burden until that afternoon. At work, I was picking up exercise equipment from the floor when I lost my balance and fell. I noticed that when I grabbing for things, my depth perception was altered. My boss at the time told me of the Epley maneuver, which he offered to do when the office closed. I agreed as I believed it would solve all of my symptoms from the accident. 8 pm rolled around, and my boss performed the Epley maneuver while I was on a treatment table. I sat up and began violently throwing up and shaking. I was freezing but my body was soaked in sweat. My boss said adverse reactions weren't that common. I could not function enough to walk, let alone drive, so my parents came and picked me and my car up. The ride home was torturous, and I barely made it up the porch stairs before vomiting again. The night continued on and I faced irreconcilable vertigo and nausea. I woke up screaming ""I'm falling!"" with clenched fists and hammering lungs. Vertigo would come and go in waves until I resorted to sleeping sitting up. In the two weeks that followed, I would have severe ""falling attacks"" where I was hit with overwhelming vertigo that rendered me unable to move. I finally made an appointment with my family doctor. An MRI was scheduled, and the doctor prescribed numerous vertigo medications, including Antivert, Ativan, Lorazepam, and others. After about two months, my symptoms faded, and I never thought much of it. I never got results from the MRI but as a college student, I didn't care as long as I was feeling okay. The new year came and left, and I was ready to finish out my second year of college. Late in March 2013, I had severe numbness in my right arm. My ""highfives"" would hit my friends' faces, my arm would casually hit people next to me as I walked by them, and my ability to grip a pencil disappeared. Working for a PT & chiro, I firmly believed it was a pinched nerve. I went to an orthopedic who pricked me with pinchy and prickly tools, and tickled the right side of my body including my face, neck, back, arm, and leg. I found it funny and awkward at the same time. When he sent me for a preliminary MRI I thought no big deal of it. When the results came back, he sent me for 4 more MRIs and I knew something wasn't right. Frantic diagnoses were being made, and test after test was run. Bloodwork, Western blot test, spinal tap, EP, and so on. My spinal test was a bizarre experience. During this process, my MRI from 2012 surfaced. It turned out my family doctor had called my mother with the results, and noted that the presence of MS was possible, but since I was not presenting symptoms, they chose not to pursue the diagnosis. In hindsight, the vertigo was clearly related to MS, triggered by the car accident. That MRI did not change the present situation. The spinal tap was horrific. The treating doctor did the procedure bedside, and unguided, while I screamed in agony. He was unable to reach the spinal column the first try, and his second and third attempts were as unsuccessful. When his fourth attempt made minimal contact, he extracted barely enough spinal fluid for the test, and blamed it on scoliosis which I do not have. He left the hospital room saying rest for several hours and drink a can of Coke - the caffeine would help alleviate any symptoms from the spinal tap. The truth of the matter is that his bedside ""experiment"" left me with a puncture in my spinal column, preventing my body from pressurizing the spinal column, leaving me with severe nausea and vomiting, dizziness, headaches, and inability to leave the bed. During the week, I was rushed to the ER for severe pain and vomiting. I was released the next day. After these symptoms continued for a week, the treating doctor who performed the spinal tap agreed to see me again. It was quickly discovered that I need a blood patch to clot the puncture in my spinal column. The blood patch cured my issues, and I left that doctor's office and never returned. The next three years have been filled with emotional rollercoasters, but I am always a step further on my journey, a little closer to living the fullest life possible. I started out using Copaxone but retired when I discovered the effects on fertility. I became vegan for a year, as much evidence supports a plant-based diet is an effective treatment of MS. Now I live day to day, thankful each morning that I'm not paralyzed. I recently started working out and have chosen to live a natural life and take the episodes as they come. Much Love.

MS Ireland helps researchers with their projects by offering advice, data and access to our MS community. We encourage people with MS to get involved in research that is ethical, appropriately organised by a recognised institution and sanctioned by that research authority. 1. The MS Research Team at the University of Limerick, led by Professor Susan Coote, have developed a falls prevention programme for people with multiple sclerosis and we would like to assess how suitable and effective the programme is. More info >>. 2. A Health Research Board funded study called ‘ Patients’ Preferences for Health’ are looking for volunteers. 3. Fintan Murphy (MSc Physiotherapy) along with Professor Susan Coote (School of Allied Health) of the University of Limerick are inviting you to take part in an online questionnaire examining physical activity behaviour in people with Multiple Sclerosis . This is an international project in collaboration with researchers in the USA and in Germany. 4. All-Ireland genomics study - Irish life sciences company, Genomics Medicine Ireland (GMI) have announced an important scientific research study aimed at unlocking the mystery of the genetic and lifestyle factors that contribute to MS. Volunteers with MS currently being treated at St. Vincent’s University Hospital, Tallaght Hospital, Cork University Hospital or Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry are invited to participate in the study which aims to identify these factors in order to find better treatments, diagnoses and, ultimately, a cure for MS. GMI also hopes to rollout additional study sites around the country in future. Interested volunteers should speak with their clinical team at one of the current research sites for more information. 5. Online mindfulness programme - The Centre for Pain Research at NUI Galway is currently recruiting people with MS to take part in a free, online and internet-delivered mindfulness programme. If you are interested in taking part, email or call (091) 495391 or visit Centre of Pain website for further information. 6. Post-traumatic stress disorder after MS diagnosis - Gary Treacy, a PhD student from NUI Maynooth, is conducting a study looking at how people act in response to receiving a diagnosis of a chronic medical illness (i.e., Multiple Sclerosis). Participants would be required, on one occasion, to complete a questionnaire booklet containing numerous psychological measures. The duration of completing the questionnaire booklet is approximately 20 to 30 minutes. To participate, please follow the following link Information is available in the Participant Information Leaflet . If you require further information regarding any aspect of the proposed study now or at any time in the future, please contact the researcher Gary Treacy on 087-6511659.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705849243428347934/RNAs-are-involved-in-protein-aggregation-and-neurodegenerative-diseases,-research-reveals	RNAs are involved in protein aggregation and neurodegenerative diseases, research reveals	"Reviewed by James Ives, MPsych Feb 8 2019. New research reveals RNAs, which are crucial for cells to produce proteins, are also involved in protein aggregation, where proteins do not fold properly and 'clump' together into aggregates. If cells cannot clear these away, they become toxic and prevent cells working properly. This discovery, led by scientists at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona, reveals that RNAs act as a 'scaffold' to hold several proteins that stick to RNAs together, and that certain RNA molecules with distinct properties attract more proteins and encourage proteins to aggregate. They also investigated how an RNA called FMR1 is implicated in a neurodegenerative disease called Fragile X Tremor Syndrome, or FXTAS. Many neurodegenerative diseases are linked to protein aggregation, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. We know that proteins can form toxic aggregates, but until now, the contribution of nucleic acid molecules such as RNA has been up for debate. CRG researcher and ICREA Research Professor Gian Gaetano Tartaglia and CRG Alumni Teresa Botta-Orfila, and currently at Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), wanted to understand how RNA can promote aggregation. In their research, published in the journal Cell Reports , they discovered that specific RNAs do indeed interact with many proteins within cells, and that these RNAs have distinct properties - they are structured, have a long area of untranslated genetic code called a UTR region, and often contain several repeats of genetic code (called CGG expansions) within them. ""Using theoretical tools, Fernando Cid in the group investigated how an RNA called FMR1 attracts proteins in FXTAS,"" explains Gian Gaetano Tartaglia. ""Together with Teresa we then worked out the proteins that bind to FMR1 using novel lab approaches and identified one of them as a protein called TRA2A. Using cells, mouse models of FXTAS and post-mortem samples from patients, we confirmed that TRA2A aggregates with FMR1 in this disease and we studied the consequences of its aggregation. Now that we know the components of some of these aggregates, we can begin to understand what is causing this disease and it may reveal new ways to treat it."" Botta-Orfila continues: ""We were surprised to find that our predicted interactions could act as biomarkers for the disease. And it was particularly exciting that we detected the TRA2A protein in the brains of people with the disease - it was one of the most important findings in my time at CRG. Lots of things suddenly made sense. The TRA2A protein that we discovered was involved in FXTAS is involved in RNA splicing, a crucial process that ensures the pieces of genetic code are in the correct order and produce the right protein. Because this protein aggregates in FXTAS, it isn't carrying out the splicing process correctly - and as a result many RNAs are altered and cannot work properly."" And the team's biomarker discovery has raised more interesting questions that they'd like to answer. ""Many of the genes that we found were deregulated because of protein aggregation are related to brain development, which is a key factor in disease development,"" explains Gian Gaetano Tartaglia. The team now have an arsenal of proteins to test for FXTAS, and they would like to extend their work to other complex diseases. In the longer term, they would also like to discover the function of sticky RNAs. Together, this work could improve our understanding of complex diseases where protein aggregation is important and could ultimately reveal new ways to treat them.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705660536954791259/Blood-clotting-protein-contributes-to-Alzheimer's	Blood-clotting protein contributes to Alzheimer's	"According to existing guidelines , the main mechanism associated with cognitive problems in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease is the formation of beta-amyloid plaques. These are buildups of toxic proteins that disrupt the normal functioning of synapses. Synapses are the connections formed between brain cells that allow information to circulate within and to and from the brain. However, in a new study from the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, CA, a team of researchers has identified another mechanism that affects how synapses work, contributing to Alzheimer's pathology. The researchers began by investigating problems that appear in the blood vessel network in the brain, which is another biological characteristic of this form of dementia . Senior investigator Prof. Katerina Akassoglou and her team have for the first time identified a blood-derived protein that leaks into the brain disrupting cell-to-cell communication. The findings , which appear in the journal Neuron , indicate that in Alzheimer's, fibrinogen, a protein that usually contributes to blood clotting, plays a vital role in cognitive dysfunction. New factor: 'Blood leaks in the brain'. In this study, the investigators used sophisticated imaging technology to scan both the brains of mice simulating a form of dementia and those of people with an Alzheimer's diagnosis. Through their analyses, the researchers found that fibrinogen passes from blood vessels into the brain, triggering immune cell activity, which in turn leads to the breakdown of synapses. To confirm the protein's role in synaptic breakdown, the team tried blocking fibrinogen's action on the brain's immune cells in a mouse model of Alzheimer's. This strategy protected the rodents from experiencing the type of memory loss typically associated with this condition. We found that blood leaks in the brain can cause elimination of neuronal connections that are important for memory functions. This could change the way we think about the cause and possible cure of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease and other neurological diseases."" Moreover, Prof. Akassoglou and her team found that leaked fibrinogen can lead to synaptic breakdown even in the absence of beta-amyloid plaques. When the researchers injected even the smallest of quantities of fibrinogen into healthy brains, they saw that the protein triggered the same mechanism that caused the loss of synapses as it did in brains affected by Alzheimer's disease. ""Traditionally, the buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain has been seen as the root of memory loss and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease,"" explains the study's first author, Mario Merlini. ""Our work identifies an alternative culprit that could be responsible for the destruction of synapses,"" he notes . 'Far-reaching therapeutic implications'. The team that conducted the current study explains that existing research has shown that cerebrovascular problems, as well as the formation of beta-amyloid plaques, each contribute to cognitive decline . Moreover, both of these pathologies contribute to the cognitive decline at similar rates. However, the researchers add that people who present both pathologies at the same time experience much quicker neurodegeneration. Akassoglou and colleagues believe that their current findings finally offer an explanation for these phenomena. ""Given the human data showing that vascular changes are early and additive to amyloid, a conclusion from those studies is that vascular changes may have to be targeted with separate therapies if we want to ensure maximum protection against the destruction of neuronal connections that leads to cognitive decline,"" notes the senior researcher. So far, researchers have been developing therapies targeting beta-amyloid, but these new findings suggest that other therapeutic targets may also be valuable. ""These exciting findings greatly advance our understanding of the contributions that vascular pathology and brain inflammation make to the progression of Alzheimer's disease,"" says study co-author Dr. Lennart Mucke. ""The mechanisms our study identified may also be at work in a range of other diseases that combine leaks in the blood-brain barrier with neurological decline, including multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. It has far-reaching therapeutic implications,"" he adds. utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_country=US&utm_hcp=no&utm_campaign=MNT%20Daily%20Full%20%28non-HCP%20US%29%20-%20OLD%20STYLE%202019-02-07&utm_term=MNT%20Daily%20News%20%28non-HCP%20US%29.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705466317099911535/Researchers-show-efficacy-of-new-therapy-for-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-in-mice	Researchers show efficacy of new therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in mice	"Reviewed by James Ives, MPsych Feb 7 2019. A team from Université Laval and the CERVO Brain Research Centre has demonstrated the efficacy in mice of a new therapy that addresses the main manifestation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The researchers developed an antibody that reduces the number of TDP-43 protein aggregates in the brains of mice with ALS, resulting in significant improvements in their cognitive and motor performance. Details of this breakthrough were recently published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation . ""ALS is characterized by a degeneration of the neurons that control muscle activity,"" explained Jean-Pierre Julien, principal investigator and professor at Université Laval' Faculty of Medicine. ""It causes a progressive weakening of the arms and legs followed by paralysis and, two to five years later, respiratory problems that lead to death. There is no treatment for this disease, which affects 1 in 1,000 adults."" Dr. Julien and his team had already demonstrated in previous work that TDP-43 protein was overexpressed in the spinal cords of people with ALS. This overexpression leads to the formation of TDP-43 aggregates in nerve cells and an exaggerated inflammatory response that increases the neurons' vulnerability. In their most recent study, Professor Julien and his colleagues produced an antibody that targets the TDP-43 protein. They inserted the genetic material encoding this antibody into viruses that were then injected into the nervous system of mice producing TDP-43 aggregates. ""We subsequently observed a reduction in the number of aggregates of this protein,"" explained Professor Julien. ""We also found a decrease in the immune response and a significant improvement in the mice's cognitive and motor performance."" This breakthrough paves the way for the development of immunotherapies for ALS and frontotemporal dementias involving TDP-43 aggregates.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715562377112502979/Signs-on-early-onset-Parkinsons?	Signs on early onset Parkinsons?	Hello, I hope this message finds you and that you are doing well as i realize this post was several years old! I came across your story on these forums and could not believe how close ours match, down to the month it started and age. I was hoping you would be kind enough to share if you have found anything out by now? I would appreciate any tips for recovery. Here is a quick background on my story. I am a 31 year old male, who recently had my first born son in June of this year. One night in mid October, my middle finger on my right hand started twitching out of nowhere for several hours. I began to feel light headed as well and googled the symptoms (huge mistake). I came across ALS, Parkinson's and MS. I watched my grandpa die of Parkinson's and my 15 year old cousin was just diagnosed with MS. The amount of anxiety and stress that came over me was like nothing i have ever experienced before as all i could think about is the burden i would be on my wife and newborn son and how i might not live to see him grow up. A week later my forearm became extremely tight as if i had worked it out. My fingers became physically hard to move. Over the following week it worked it's way up to my bicep, tricep, elbow, and shoulder. I had these burning pains in all these muscle groups purely on my right side, but they never all hurt at the same time. It continued to jump around and eventually spread into my back, armpit, and across my chest. My anxiety was so bad the PCP had to put me on xanax as i for sure thought i was done. It got so bad one night I had to go to the ER, they did a CT scan and it all came back normal. Over the following weeks my legs became extremely tight, and I have noticed my right hand seems to be colder than the left. The middle finger finally stopped after 3 weeks, but i now have twitching all over my body. Shoulder blades, biceps, legs, no place is safe. My left arm has started to tighten up a bit as well, but not to the extent of my right arm which still remains in a lot of pain at my elbow and shoulder. My middle finger still feels very tingly. I have had to stop going to the gym and running completely. Since then, i have had an MRI of my brain, cervical spine, and lungs (looking for a tumor), 18 blood test with nothing showing, a spectrum of heart test that all came back ok, and 2 EMG's, 2 NCV's by separate neurologist because I can't shake the thought of als. The only abnormalities I have are 4 bulging disc in my neck, which my neurologist says wouldn't cause this, and one NCV showing mild carpal tunnel in both arms and mild cubital tunnel in the right arm. The neurologist and orthopedic doctor both said they aren't causing this either. My neurologist's excuse is that i am 31 and too young for these diseases, which only makes it worse being told that as i know i physically feel something wrong. I started physical therapy 4 weeks ago, but am barely seeing any improvement. A steroid pack didn't do anything either. I would be unbelievably grateful if you could let me know if you ended up finding anything. Part of me believes mine could be entirely stress and anxiety as I have been in a constant state of worry since October with the fears ALS and Parkinson's. That along with being constantly light headed has rendered me unable to drive for the past 3 months and put a horrible strain on my marriage not being able to help with my son. My next appointments aren't till March and I feel that I will mentally break by then. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you for your time,. 	1	1	Signs|on|early|onset|Parkinsons|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715562054808358032/Post-of-the-Week:-New-Study-on-Constant-Current-DBS	Post of the Week: New Study on Constant Current DBS	Dear forum members this was published in Lancet Neurology online this week. Lancet Neurol. 2012 Jan 10. [Epub ahead of print]. Subthalamic deep brain stimulation with a constant-current device in Parkinson's disease: an open-label randomised controlled trial. Okun MS, Gallo BV, Mandybur G, Jagid J, Foote KD, Revilla FJ, Alterman R, Jankovic J, Simpson R, Junn F, Verhagen L, Arle JE, Ford B, Goodman RR, Stewart RM, Horn S, Baltuch GH, Kopell BH, Marshall F, Peichel D, Pahwa R, Lyons KE, Tröster AI, Vitek JL, Tagliati M; for the SJM DBS Study Group. Source. Department of Neurology, Center for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, USA. Abstract. BACKGROUND:. The effects of constant-current deep brain stimulation (DBS) have not been studied in controlled trials in patients with Parkinson's disease. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of bilateral constant-current DBS of the subthalamic nucleus. METHODS:. This prospective, randomised, multicentre controlled trial was done between Sept 26, 2005, and Aug 13, 2010, at 15 clinical sites specialising in movement disorders in the USA. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18-80 years, had Parkinson's disease for 5 years or more, and had either 6 h or more daily off time reported in a patient diary of moderate to severe dyskinesia during waking hours. The patients received bilateral implantation in the subthalamic nucleus of a constant-current DBS device. After implantation, computer-generated randomisation was done with a block size of four, and patients were randomly assigned to the stimulation or control group (stimulation:control ratio 3:1). The control group received implantation without activation for 3 months. No blinding occurred during this study, and both patients and investigators were aware of the treatment group. The primary outcome variable was the change in on time without bothersome dyskinesia (ie, good quality on time) at 3 months as recorded in patients' diaries. Patients were followed up for 1 year. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT00552474. FINDINGS:. Of 168 patients assessed for eligibility, 136 had implantation of the constant-current device and were randomly assigned to receive immediate (101 patients) or delayed (35 patients) stimulation. Both study groups reported a mean increase of good quality on time after 3 months, and the increase was greater in the stimulation group (4·27 h vs 1·77 h, difference 2·51 [95% CI 0·87-4·16]; p=0·003). Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale motor scores in the off-medication, on-stimulation condition improved by 39% from baseline (24·8 vs 40·. Some serious adverse events occurred after DBS implantation, including infections in five (4%) of 136 patients and intracranial haemorrhage in four (3%) patients. Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus was associated with dysarthria, fatigue, paraesthesias, and oedema, whereas gait problems, disequilibrium, dyskinesia, and falls were reported in both groups. INTERPRETATION:. Constant-current DBS of the subthalamic nucleus produced significant improvements in good quality on time when compared with a control group without stimulation. Future trials should compare the effects of constant-current DBS with those of voltage-controlled stimulation. FUNDING:. St Jude Medical Neuromodulation Division. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4701642505965412618/Vitamin-D-supplements-arent-living-up-to-their-hype	Vitamin D supplements aren’t living up to their hype	"In the supplement world, vitamin D is a bit like a Kardashian. Its fame seemed to come out of nowhere about a decade ago, garnering so much press so fast that it’s hard to remember a time when people weren’t talking about it. Vitamin D had long been known for protecting bones, but its star began to rise in the early 2000s after researchers made connections hinting that vitamin D was good for a lot more than our skeletons. It appeared to help protect against a lengthy list of ailments, including multiple sclerosis, asthma, depression, heart disease and cancer. The vitamin also was said to improve athletic performance. Organizations like the Vitamin D Council — the 2003 brainchild of a psychiatrist who became a vitamin D enthusiast — began to actively promote the benefits to the public and to physicians, while selling test kits for vitamin D blood levels. Doctors checked for it; patients demanded testing. Researchers latched on. But with more research comes more scrutiny, and most recently, a series of seemingly tarnishing findings. On November 10, the New England Journal of Medicine published the largest study so far to test vitamin D supplements’ protection against cancer and heart disease . The results were generally interpreted as inconclusive at best and disappointing at worst. One 2017 review of the evidence for cardiovascular benefits concluded that studies of people taking vitamin D “have failed to show clear improvements in blood pressure, insulin sensitivity or lipid parameters.”. Even the vitamin’s reputation for helping bones took a hit last April from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The independent group, which makes health policy recommendations, concluded that when it comes to preventing fractures, there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against supplementation. Today, enthusiasm for the vitamin, at least in scientific circles, is fading, says Clifford Rosen, an osteoporosis researcher at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute in Scarborough. “I think even in the bone world, where we know vitamin D may have some effect, the studies aren’t very compelling.” Which leads to the question: Is the sun finally setting on vitamin D? Does a body good? The body makes vitamin D when exposed to ultraviolet light, or absorbs it from food. Once in the bloodstream, vitamin D undergoes several transformations into a hormone that helps strengthen bones. Research showing its effects on other organs is coming up short. The liver converts. cholecalciferol to. 25-hydroxycholecalciferol . The kidneys then convert 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to the active hormone. calcitriol . Cholecalciferol is. circulated through the blood to the liver. UV-B light from the. sun reacts with. 7-dehydrocholesterol in skin and creates cholecalciferol. (vitamin D3). Calcitriol benefits:. • Increases absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestines. • Increases bone mineralization. Potential connections under study:. • Immune system. • Cancer. • Heart disease. • Multiple sclerosis. • Depression. Vitamin D2 and D3 are consumed through foods and supplements. Vitamin D2 and D3 are consumed through. foods and supplements. UV-B light from. the sun reacts with. 7-dehydrocholesterol. in skin and creates. cholecalciferol. Potential connections. under study:. E. Otwell. Shining a light. The answer, as with most matters of nutrition, is complicated. One thing is indisputable: The body must have vitamin D. Throughout most of human history, rickets was a feared childhood disease. As babies became toddlers, their legs and arms would sometimes bend like willow branches. Even affluence offered no protection: Some victims were the sons and daughters of the Medici family, the powerful dynasty of the Italian Renaissance. Finally, in the early 1900s, doctors figured out the cause — insufficient sun. In 1919, a German doctor showed that rickets could be treated by exposing an affected arm to ultraviolet lamps. Remarkably, sun exposure on one arm healed both. The cure came not from sunshine itself, but from vitamin D, an essential chemical that the body makes in the presence of UV light. For discovering the mechanism of vitamin D formation, German chemist Adolf Windaus won a Nobel Prize in 1928. Over the following decades, foods were increasingly fortified and rickets gradually disappeared in most places. Vitamin D became little more than a mention on milk cartons and bottles of orange juice. In the body, this essential nutrient travels a convoluted path, starting with a substance in the skin called 7-dehydrocholesterol. In the presence of sunlight, that chemical is transformed into vitamin D, or cholecalciferol, and enters the bloodstream. When it reaches the liver, vitamin D is converted into another chemical, 25-(OH)D, or 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. In the kidneys and other organs, 25-(OH)D changes into the active form of vitamin D, called calcitriol. Calcitriol, a hormone, is so named because it encourages calcium absorption through the wall of the intestine into the bloodstream. Vitamin D’s primary job is to help the body absorb calcium from food. Rickets occurs when bones are starved of calcium. Vitamin D also aids in the uptake of phosphorus, another bone-strengthening nutrient. “For a long time, it was thought the benefit was mainly on bone health,” says Walter Willett, an epidemiologist and nutrition researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Then scientists began to discover that a broad array of tissues contain proteins that serve as welcome mats for the vitamin. “There were receptors for vitamin D in almost every organ in the body, not just in bones,” Willett says. “What was vitamin D doing in places other than bone?”. By the late 1990s, scientists were finding links between low sunlight exposure and a variety of diseases, some of them surprising. Several studies noted that the farther north a person lived — a proxy for less intense sun — the higher the risk of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions. In one early study, published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention , women who lived in the sunnier parts of the United States had breast cancer rates that were 25 percent to as much as 65 percent lower than women who lived farther north . Another study that made headlines in 2008, from Archives of Internal Medicine , reported that Americans in the lower quarter of vitamin D blood levels had a 26 percent higher chance of death over the nine years studied than those with the highest levels of vitamin D. In other words, a lot of early research suggested that people with abundant vitamin D — or at least with the best chances of sun exposure — appeared to be healthier. Problem is, there may be other reasons that less sun correlates with certain diseases, says JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. People may not be going outdoors because they are ill, for example, or less inclined to exercise. The amount of sun “may not be causally related in any way to these health outcomes,” Manson says. Or a low vitamin D blood level could be a consequence of obesity; the vitamin is soluble in fat, so it can become sequestered inside adipose tissue. The detriment to health may not be from low vitamin D directly, but from excess body weight, too little physical activity or other known influences on a person’s health. The central question today is not whether the body needs vitamin D — it absolutely does — but whether the average person should be taking a supplement. There is widespread public belief that it’s a good idea. According to market research firm Euromonitor International, annual U.S. consumer spending on vitamin D has risen from $248 million in 2008 to more than $1 billion today. $248 billion U.S. consumer spending on vitamin D in 2008 $1 billion U.S. consumer spending on vitamin D today. One of the first randomized controlled trials to study vitamin D supplementation, by researchers at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., was published in 2007. In that study, 1,179 women over age 55 were randomly assigned to take about 1,500 milligrams daily of calcium, calcium plus 1,100 international units, or IUs, of vitamin D (that’s about twice the recommended dietary allowance, or RDA), or a placebo. Writing in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , the researchers reported a dramatically lower (more than 50 percent) cancer incidence after four years among the women in the vitamin D with calcium group compared with those who took a placebo — at least when the results analyzed women who had stayed in the study for a year or more. There were 18 cancers diagnosed after the second year in the placebo group compared with eight among women who took calcium plus vitamin D. The finding made sense because around this time, a growing number of laboratory studies demonstrated that the vitamin had anticancer properties in lab animals. “People tended to glom on to positive results because they wanted them to be true,” says Steven Abrams, a pediatrician at the University of Texas at Austin and a member of a 2010 Institute of Medicine panel that evaluated vitamin D ( SN: 7/16/11, p. 22 ). “Negative studies were buried, harder to find.”. In 2010, a headline in the New York Times read, “Vitamin D, Miracle Drug: Is It Science, or Just Talk?” The story described a clinical trial named VITAL that was just starting at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, with Manson as one of the study leaders. At almost 26,000 participants, VITAL would become the largest randomized trial to measure whether men over 50 and women over 55 who took a daily vitamin D supplement of 2,000 IUs were protected from cancer and heart disease. (The study also tested fish oil supplements.) Importantly, more than 5,000 volunteers were African-American. People with darker skin may have a harder time making vitamin D in sunlight because they don’t absorb as much UV light, the driver of vitamin D formation. VITAL became one of the most anticipated vitamin D studies. D-flating news. VITAL trial results were released in November in Chicago at the American Heart Association’s annual scientific sessions and published in the New England Journal of Medicine . Fish oil supplements offered some benefits, preventing heart attacks, but not stroke. Extra vitamin D offered no heart protection ( SN: 12/8/18, p. 9 ). People tended to glom on to positive results because they wanted them to be true. — Steven Abrams. As for cancer prevention, the study produced “a complex finding,” Manson says. Over the entire five years, there was no reduction in the risk of being diagnosed with breast, prostate or colon cancer, but the overall risk of dying from cancer was slightly lower. In all, 154 deaths from cancer occurred in the vitamin D group versus 187 in the placebo group. When the analysis was narrowed to those who were in the trial for at least two years, the researchers saw a 25 percent reduction in death from cancer with vitamin D. Perhaps vitamin D makes tumors less likely to grow and spread, Manson says. If that’s true, any benefit would take time to appear. “This warrants further study,” she says. The VITAL results were the latest of a string of largely discouraging news. In 2017, scientists had reported the results of a study testing whether monthly high doses of vitamin D could prevent heart problems. About 5,000 people from the general population of New Zealand were randomly assigned to receive the vitamin D boost or a placebo. In JAMA Cardiology , the researchers reported that supplementation made no difference . As a safeguard against bone fractures, vitamin D has not fared much better. Because the vitamin is necessary for bone health, many doctors recommend supplements for older people to help prevent breaks and falls. Yet the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded last spring that the evidence for this advice was still inconclusive. Another blow came in October, when researchers reported in Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology that a review and summary of studies so far “suggest that vitamin D supplementation does not prevent fractures or falls, or have clinically meaningful effects on bone mineral density .”. Sunshine on my shoulder. The National Academy of Medicine advises a vitamin D intake of 600 to 800 international units per day to achieve blood levels of 20 nanograms/milliliter of the nutrient (one of the lower recommended thresholds). To make enough from the sun, depending on the latitude and season, about 10 minutes outside in shorts and a T-shirt will do for a light-skinned person. People with darker skin need more time. Recommended minimal vitamin D blood level. That’s not as surprising as it may seem, even given vitamin D’s claim to fame in bone health, says Catharine Ross, a nutritional biochemist at Penn State who chaired the 2010 vitamin D panel. Bone is built early in life, she says. Later in life, the body works to preserve that bone. Much of that preservation isn’t orchestrated by vitamin D itself, but by the hormone calcitriol, whose production is limited by the liver and kidneys. In other words, more vitamin D on the front end doesn’t necessarily mean more of the hormone on the back end. The news for cancer from studies other than VITAL has also been inconsistent. On the supportive side of the ledger, a compilation of studies on colorectal cancer, published last June in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute , found a clear elevation in risk for people with the lowest blood levels of the vitamin . People who had a vitamin D blood level below 12 nanograms per milliliter had a colorectal cancer risk 31 percent higher over five years than those whose blood levels were twice as high. Yet a 2017 study found that the big reduction in cancer incidence announced in 2007 by Creighton University researchers didn’t hold up. In contrast to the 2007 trial, this one, reported in JAMA by many of the same Creighton researchers, found no difference in cancer risk among postmenopausal women who took vitamin D and calcium and those who took a placebo. Overall, “there have been enough systematic reviews and large randomized controlled trials suggesting that vitamin D does not have an effect in the primary prevention of cancer,” says Cindy Davis, director of grants and extramural activities at the Office of Dietary Supplements, part of the National Institutes of Health. She names a long list of groups that have looked at the research, including the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the World Cancer Research Fund International. “They’ve all said that there’s not enough evidence, or that the evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation does not appear to be protective” against cancer formation, Davis says. But Willett, the Harvard nutrition expert, thinks studies so far have been too short to meaningfully address the cancer question. Most tumors unfold quietly over decades, so even a five-year study might not be long enough. It would take a decade or more for solid answers. “People can smoke for 20 years and there’s no effect on cancer risk,” he says. He points to the recent colorectal cancer review suggesting a big reduction in risk with higher blood levels of vitamin D. “If that was a drug, it would be a blockbuster.”. He also says that there are diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, that have held up over time as being associated with sunlight or vitamin D. One of the latest studies appeared in April in Neurology . Researchers from Harvard and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver measured the risk of multiple sclerosis across a lifetime of sun exposure. People who lived in areas with the highest amounts of UV light had a 45 percent lower risk of the disease than those who lived in areas with the lowest sun exposure, and the protection appeared to be much more pronounced among people who reported high summer sun in childhood and adolescence. Studies are now testing whether adding various doses of vitamin D to regular treatments can help people with MS. Other studies are testing prevention or treatment of asthma, diabetes and depression. Help for MS. Evidence that vitamin D might help protect against multiple sclerosis has been building. One recent report found generally higher death rates from MS in northern U.S. states, where sunlight is less intense and winter days are shorter, compared with southern states. (In the graph below, a few states are excluded because of low population numbers.) Researchers are now testing whether vitamin D supplementation added to MS treatment might help people with the disease. Multiple sclerosis deaths in U.S. states by latitude. Source: G.E. Davis and W.E. Lowell/ J. Photochem. and PhotobioL. B: Biol. 2015. Testing tumult. Judging by the market, millions of health-conscious consumers aren’t waiting for science to work everything out. Some researchers worry that promotion of vitamin D has created a misguided “more is better” mind-set. At high doses, “there are some studies that do show harm,” says Davis, of the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements. Participants in the VITAL study, which included a daily dose of 2,000 IUs, did not appear to have any major side effects. But some pills are sold at much higher amounts, as high as 50,000 IUs to be taken weekly. And some pills contain the less-accessible form of vitamin D produced by plants, called D2, not the version made by the human body, called D3. Nothing about vitamin D is simple. Its effects probably have a U-shaped curve for some diseases, Davis says. Too little or too much in the bloodstream can be harmful, but most levels in the middle are fine. Testing bonanza. With growing publicity on potential health benefits of vitamin D, testing for the nutrient surpassed testing for other nutrients in older Americans after 2008. Blood testing for various nutrients. Source: S. Shahangian et al / Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med . 2014. One paper published in 2018 in Cancer Research examined 19 studies of vitamin D’s association with prostate cancer. That analysis found that higher levels of vitamin D were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer , although the researchers say this could be due to detection bias — perhaps the men with high vitamin D were more health conscious and more likely to get screened for the disease. Which gets back to the thorny issue of whether it’s necessary to check your vitamin D levels, which can cost from around $50 to more than $100 if it’s not covered by insurance. Testing has grown exponentially, Willett says, yet “we still don’t know what target number we should be aiming for.”. Public health officials recommend blood levels above 20 ng/ml. The Endocrine Society, which represents doctors, states that some adults are deficient if their levels are below 30 ng/ml. Advocates like the Vitamin D Council set higher thresholds. In addition to disagreement over a target number, there is controversy over which form of vitamin D to measure, and how to measure it. Davis says testing is tricky because the vitamin goes through several steps to get to its active form. The best marker of vitamin D status is 25-(OH)D, she says. That’s the form that the liver makes (not the kind that enters the bloodstream from the skin). But until recently there were no standards for measuring 25-(OH)D. A 2017 report in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology pointed out how results can vary from test to test : One method suggested a decline in vitamin D levels in the American population from the late 1980s to the early 2000s; another, testing blood from the exact same people, showed no change. Same samples, different test, different results. As the authors note, “the vitamin D field is in chaos.”. Results may vary. Controversy has surrounded vitamin D testing, which has lacked rigorous standards. Analysis by one method (left) suggested that vitamin D levels were falling among Americans. Yet a more standardized analysis of the same samples (right) showed very little difference. Impact of standardizing blood testing for vitamin D. Source: N. Binkley et al / J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2017. Willett doesn’t see much value in focusing on blood test numbers. Even if you don’t know your exact levels, taking 1,000 or 2,000 IUs “is a reasonable thing to do,” he says, given studies finding that the level is safe and showing evidence of benefit against cancer death. Rosen, from the Maine Medical Center, doesn’t think the supplements will make a dramatic difference in health, but agrees that a 2,000-IU supplement won’t do harm either. “When I go and talk to doctors I say, ‘How many [of you] are taking vitamin D?’ The hands go up,” he says. Most of them. When he asks why, the doctors respond, “ ‘Eventually it’s going to be proven that it prevents something.’ ” Belief in vitamin D runs deep. That said, there are certain populations that doctors already know may need supplements to reach even minimally adequate levels: babies who are exclusively breastfed, some people with dark skin, some who live in northern latitudes and people who don’t have much exposure to daylight because they live in institutions such as nursing homes or hospitals. Amid the uncertainty, clinicians are left to advise patients. By nature, researchers zero in on just a few specifics in their studies. “But the world isn’t like that. The world is very complicated,” says Dena Herman, a nutrition researcher at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. In the end, people have to consider their own personal circumstances, she says. Herman doesn’t immediately suggest supplements when a patient appears to have inadequate levels of vitamin D. Often these patients are overweight, which could be affecting their vitamin D levels. “I usually recommend they get more physically active and get in the sun first,” she says. “If people could master the basics, they wouldn’t have to worry about supplements.”.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715385947604595917/Rapid-Analysis-of-Trisulfide-Formation-in-Biopharmaceuticals	Rapid Analysis of Trisulfide Formation in Biopharmaceuticals	Sponsored Content by Bruker Daltonics Mar 6 2019. The structure of biopharmaceuticals can be altered by chemical artifacts like disulfide structure modification or deamidation events. In this context, the formation of trisulfides is a particularly challenging artifact. During the development of antibody drug conjugates, high trisulfide levels tend to interfere with specific conjugation chemistries. Such potential problems should be addressed early in the development pipeline in order to prevent costly remediation downstream. Keywords Instrumentation and Software. Biopharmaceuticals rapifleX MALDI-TOF/TOF. PTMs ultrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF. Artifactual modifications DisulfideDetect software. Disulfide Crosslinks LC-MALDI Fraction Spotter FCII. Therefore, a fully automated technique has been already developed for identifying disulfide structures in biopharmaceuticals predicated on an LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF workflow. In this analysis, the extension of this workflow was assessed in relation to the extra detection of trisulfides. In the experimental method, a monoclonal IgG1 antibody (mAb) sample with increased levels of trisulfide formation (Pfizer) and a range of mAbs — IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4: adalimumab, panitumumab, and natalizumab — available on the market were digested using Lys-C/trypsin under non-reducing conditions. nanoLC was used to separate peptides, which were detected on a MALDI target at an interval of 10 seconds. MS/MS spectra were subsequently acquired using a rapifleX MALDI-TOF/TOF at high speed — utilizing Bruker’s 10 kHz smartbeam 3D laser. The Bruker DisulfideDetect software — provided for detecting and identifying the anticipated disulfide bonds inclusive of scrambled disulfides — enabled fully automated data analysis. The following manual analysis of the same LC-MALDI dataset produced species 32 Da higher in comparison with the corresponding disulfide — comprising of peptides (DSB-peptides). It was inferred that such species from the detected peptides contained trisulfides (TSB-peptides). For a relatively simpler and quicker analysis, a new technique was developed using stepwise elution from ZipTips (Millipore) to establish the trisulfide content in one MALDI mass spectrum. Automated disulfide bond analysis using DisulfideDetect software and rapifleX instrumentation established the mAbs’ disulfide bond state, as indicated in Figure 1 for adalimumab. Figure 1. Resulting disulfide structure printout of a human IgG1 antibody (adalimumab) in the DisulfideDetect software. The disulfide bond is highlighted that links LC and HC. This particular site — together with the hinge di-peptide — is susceptible to trisulfide formation. This method was used to analyze all asymmetric dipeptides with a single disulfide bond. It is known that the inter-chain disulfides between the HC and the LC are particularly sensitive to the formation of trisulfide and were further assessed manually. This peptide present in human IgG1 is a short, hydrophilic one (1261.5 Da), eluting at low acetonitrile concentration in an RP-LC gradient. The LC–HC dipeptide in human IgG2 and IgG4 is larger (2039.94 Da) and elutes much later in the gradient. In all the four antibodies, MS/MS was used to detect and identify trisulfide dipeptides. Table 1 lists the quantitative results. Table 1. Quantitation results on the LC-HC dipeptides of a Pfizer mAb and other IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 antibodies. mAb Method Trisulfide content. Pfizer IgG1 mAb LC-MALDI 13.5 ± 2.6%. Pfizer IgG1 mAb ZipTip 9.5 ± 0.75%. Pfizer IgG1 mAb ESI-qTOF 11.3%. Adalimumab LC-MALDI 0.6%. Adalimumab ZipTip 0.65%. Panitumumab LC-MALDI 1.9%. Natalizumab LC-MALDI 0.4%. It was observed that the IgG1 mAb (Pfizer) exhibited an increased formation of trisulfides in the LC-HC dipeptide (see Figure 2) — 11.3% correlates with earlier LC-ESI-qTOF experiments (see Table 1). Three LC-MALDI simulates with three MS measurements each showed an average trisulfide amount of 13.5% ± 2.6% (CV=19%). For the three therapeutic mAbs, trisulfide rates were determined between 0.4% and 1.9% from just one LC-MALDI experiment. Figure 2. LC-MALDI-MS analysis of the IgG1 mAb (Pfizer) reveals increased disulfide formation. The regular LC-HC linkage DSB-peptide (SS) and the corresponding TSB-peptide (SSS) are marked accordingly. The disulfide and disulfide dipeptides elute with a difference of 2 minutes and were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS. Apart from the LC-MALDI analysis, a simple technique was also developed to rapidly check, for example, in screening situations — the trisulfide formation of LC-HC dipeptide in human IgG1 antibodies. Furthermore, the Lys-C digest was fixed to a C18 ZipTip and elution of the LC-HC dipeptides was done using 10% ACN, 0.1% TFA, and additionally examined through MALDI-TOF-MS (see Figure 3). The result obtained from 21 replicates: average trisulfide content is 9.53% ± 0.75% (CV = 8%). Figure 3 . MALDI-TOF analysis of 2 human IgG1 antibody digests using the 10% acetonitrile ZipTip fraction for trisulfide quantitation. A: IgG1 (Pfizer) with 9.5% TSB-peptide content (from Figure2) B: adalimumab with only 0.65 % of TSB-peptide. MALDI-TOF-MS/MS identified the dipeptides in both — LC-MALDI and ZipTip analyses (see Figure 4). Figure 4. MS/MS spectra from the DSB and TSB peptides in Figure 3. The characteristic fragment pattern for both types of peptides are highlighted, they are used to assign the DSB/TSB peptide-type. MALDI-MS was studied as a novel method for identifying and quantifying trisulfides in biopharmaceuticals through:. The MS/MS data ’s quality was extremely high and compatible, enabling an easy detection and identification of trisulfides even without specialized software support.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715385988147111794/Spectral-Libraries-are-Key-for-Confident-Compound-Identification	Spectral Libraries are Key for Confident Compound Identification	Sponsored Content by Bruker Daltonics Mar 6 2019. In metabolomics, confident compound identification is still a major difficulty. While efforts are in progress to improve the definitions and levels of metabolite identifications that were initially proposed by the MSI initiative, [1-4] it is evident that higher levels of confidence can be achieved by integrating orthogonal molecular features, sophisticated software tools, and exact measurement technology. Keywords Instrumentation and Software. Metabolomics MetaboScape 2.0. Compound identification SmartFormula 3D. In-silico fragmentation MetFrag. Spectral Library Bruker HMDB Metabolite Library. In this article, a single integrated software solution is presented for improving the confidence in identifications at various levels: structure, compound class, molecular formula, or verified targeted identification (Figure 1). This highly integrated functionality is applied to the innovative MetaboScape ® 2.0 software . Figure 1. In MetaboScape 2.0, compound identification is supported by a variety of (semi-)automated tools, which are highly integrated and enable the creation of annotations at increasing levels of specificity and confidence. Conventionally, molecular formulas are created on the basis of a single precursor mass, using a limited number of elements (usually CHNOPS) and the signified mass tolerance. Smart-Formula TM enables further consideration of previous knowledge and other properties:. * “Golden Rules” [5]. * True Isotopic Pattern TM (TIP). SmartFormula 3D offers a smart interface enabling users to annotate all monoisotopic peaks of an MS/MS spectrum using fragment formulas (see Figure 2). Figure 2. An example MS/MS spectrum of gamma-glutamyl valine in SmartFormula 3D, highlighting characteristic fragments corresponding to the losses of NH 3 and CH 5 NO 2 . These are indicators for gamma-glutamyl dipeptides rather than alpha-glutamyl dipeptides. [8]. Structural Candidates Search. The CompoundCrawler TM tool available within MetaboScape can be used to obtain candidate structures of molecular formulas that are created previously. This tool queries a customizable type of public or private structural databases, including PubChem, KEGG, ChEBI, and ChemSpider. After that, identical structures can be evaluated using in-silico fragmentation. MetFrag In-Silico Fragmentation. The MetFrag [6, 7] in-silico MS/MS fragmentation algorithm is incorporated into MetaboScape 2.0 and can be used to evaluate and score structural candidates from CompoundCrawler search results to obtained MS/MS spectral information. As shown in Figure 3, explained fragments are highlighted in the original compound structure. Figure 3. Screenshot of a MetFrag result in MetaboScape. For the precursor, 182.0811 m/z SmartFormula generated three possible molecular formulas. Structural candidates for these were determined using CompoundCrawler (PubChem and custom MetaboScape AnalyteDB). For Tyrosine, 97.52% of the MS/MS intensity could be covered with explained fragments. The annotation was confirmed by an excellent Spectral Library (Bruker HMDB Metabolite Library) match and could be explained in SmartFormula 3D. MS/MS Spectral Libraries. Users can generate or import MS/MS spectral libraries . After that, these can be used to annotate compounds, if the spectral similarity fulfills the user-defined thresholds. An interactive spectral library editor is incorporated into the innovative Metabo-Scape 2.0 software. Targeted Analyte Lists. Analyte Lists are used to easily annotate the compounds with known retention times. If necessary, compounds can be associated with the entries of spectral libraries, so as to include MS/MS spectral matching. Consequently, Analyte Lists enable the integration of MS/MS, RT, and MS information for confident dereplication.

So, you think this is funny, hmmm???? Well, in retrospect, I guess I didn't suffer QUITE so severely, the first time I waxed, but, I've only talked about it a couple of times in the last 20 years I've been waxing. I had done my lower legs a few times, and thought to myself, ""Self? How hard can it be to do my bikini line. After all, I've 'mastered' the leg area. Right?"" Wow, was I wrong. There are directions you need to pull the wax strip, especially in, er, 'looser skin' areas. The leg skin is pretty tight, but, the bikini area?????....... So, I apply the strip, give it a rub, and RIPPPPPPP///////!!!!!!]&**%###. The hair was mostly gone, and the strip wasn't stuck to my skin, or anything, but, for weeks, I had the reminder, a very large, excessively bruised area, far larger than the bloody wax strip to begin with. In summer, vacation time, sigh. People assumed I had been having, er, overzealous relations with my male friend. It's been over twenty years, I am now a veteran wax strip user. I vowed to master them, and I must say, I would never go back to shaving. But for any novice users? Go to the salon the first time, and pay very, very, VERY close attention to all the steps, from application to removal.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4714502381913201298/It's-not-the-amount-of-lesions...	It's not the amount of lesions...	"Wow!! This thread occurred during the month I took off and I missed it completely! This is a very, VERY important topic. It is the topic that will be taking center stage as soon as the techniques for quantifying brain volume become available to the general practitioner. Yes, absolutely axonal degeneration is probably more responsible for our accumulating disability than our T2 inflammatory demyelinating lesions are. 99% of discussion about MS is centered around the visible lesions on the MRI, and around our symptoms and relapses. The appearance of enhancing lesions on the T2 images do correlate with appearance of new symptoms. That is the inflammatory part of MS. And most of the therapies are aimed at reducing this inflammatory process. Our doctors gage disease activity by how many new lesions we get and how many disappear. Some neurologists actually presume to tell us that the MRI picture is 1000% of the truth about our disease. No lesions=no MS. No new lesions=no progression of disease or no disease activity. Some even deny that our symptoms=disease activity if the MRI doesn't show it. We need to RUN from these doctors. It does appear that the inflammatory demyelinating plaque is most directly related to our relapses and remissions. But, we have always talked about the progressive disability we begin to accrue at some point in our disease. For some this accrual is early. These are the people that complain that some of their symptoms have appeared and steadily worsened since the beginning. This is true for me. For others, they may have little direct axonal loss early in the disease and most of their relapses seem to heal almost completely. Only after many years do they begin to collect disability. Nothing could be farther from the truth. While there is a lot of research going on with the inflammatory demyelination process, the real bulk of scientific research is focused on the topic above. We KNOW that even before any lesions form, there is some sort of direct attack on the nerve fibers themselves, causing them to die and ""drop out."" This is called ""direct axonal degeneration."" They do not demyelinate first. This is happening in the part of the white matter that looks ""normal"" on the MRIs. What causes this or triggers this is not known, but they are searching for the answers. Along with this, it is also known that severe, inflammatory demyelinating lesions can also result in death of the neuron and axonal death. But, this is not the cause of most of the loss of central nervous system tissue which results in the appearance called atrophy. People with MS have an ongoing brain and spinal cord ""atrophy"" (shrinkage) that is much faster than that which occurs normally as we age. The majority of this is from direct axonal degeneration and death and NOT from inflammatory demyelination. Yet all we hear about is inflammatory T2 lesions. Researchers are developing elegant ways of measuring brain atrophy on the MRIs. It is done by counting the digital pixels of the amount of CSF in the images. When brain tissue drops out, the new space must be filled with CSF. So as the CSF spaces enlarge, they take up more pixels on the MRI and can be calculated. But, these calculations do not seem to be available to our doctors. I can only think that if our doctors (the ones who are willing to think) had this available, they could look at someone who has classic MS relapses and makes the first Criterion of the McDonald Critieria. (That is, two clinical attacks and two separate clinical lesions) If the MRI showed no inflammatory lesions, then they could look for atrophy. In the presence of atrophy, that could be a new ""Positive MRI finding"" and the diagnosis could be made without waiting for lesions to show up. T-Lynn (where is she !!) would have been diagnosed earlier. I think many people, especially those with Primary Progressive Disease, would be able to be diagnosed earlier. PPMS is characterized by much more destruction by direct axonal degeneration than by inflammatory lesions, though some have large amounts of both. Many times people with PPMS have many smaller brain lesions and show early spinal cord atrophy. Because they often do not have the strong inflammatory T2 lesions, they are more likely to have negative LP results. In fact only 60% to 70% of PPMS patients have oligoclonal banding. But, they have early and marked brain and spinal cord atrophy. Some of the latest studies I have read have discussed that spinal cord atrophy is the most accurate predictor of real disability. I'm watching all of this with great interest. Well, this was just a jumble of the thoughts I have been wanting to write on this topic and to make into a Health Page. The lesson to take away from this is that there is a whole HUGE amount of disease occurring in our brains that our neurologists can't see as T2 lesions. And only after a huge amount of the axons have died and dropped out will they be able to see the atrophy. Does this explain some of those people with classic MS symptoms (in whom the mimics have been ruled out) who have ""normal"" MRIs? I think it does. I like the quote that ess found: ""The results suggest that the damage to normal-appearing brain tissue plays a larger role in the progression of atrophy and clinical disability than do the visible lesions,"" Dr. Vrenken said. We know it's happening. We just have to find our way to neurologists who think and see this process and forget counting MRI lesions. Comments? I recommend that everyone read this entire thread. These are important concepts and they will be new to many people. I applaud Heather's neuro for being so enlightened. Quix. "	1	0	It's|not|the|amount|of|lesions|...

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4714491891358336505/Activity-Feed---MS-Connection	Activity Feed - MS Connection	"When it came to illness or injury, I grew up in a very mind over matter kind of household. I was taught to suck it up, push through, and not complain. Basically, if you don't think you're sick, then you aren't. I carried this into my adult life. When I started experiencing the beginning symptoms of MSin 2003, I did what I always did: I ignored them. Ok, so I'm clumsy and started forgetting things, who cares right? I mentioned them to my doctor in passing; I mainly just saw her to get allergy and GERD medication. To my surprise she took interest in these seemingly small issues. Whenever I would see her every 6 months for my refill appointments she would ask about my symptoms, any differences, did they get better or worse, anything new and unusual? Still, I wasn't concerned. In 2006, my memory and cognitive problems started getting worse, it started to concern me because I worked in emergency services. A mistake I made could literally be life or death for someone. Stress and worry only started a vicious cycle and made my memory issues worse. By late 2008, I was at a point where I would go to work, then come home and cry everyday to release all the anxiety I had to hold in while on the job. It was too much. After months of misery and discussions with my husband, we decided that I should leave the career I had loved. I resigned in April 2009. After taking a few months off to be a stay at home mom, I decided to join the workforce again and was hired in a clerical position in October 2009. Fighting my failing brain power, clumsiness, and dizziness, I worked happily in my non-stressful and simple (compared to my previous work) job. It was fun and gave me something to do and make a little money. July 2010 I was delivered a one-two punch. First, I was rushed to the ER barely conscious with a high fever and ended up being hospitalized. Apparently mind over matter doesn't work on pneumonia. Weeks later, I had to have my gallbladder removed. Nothing seemed the same after that. I had vertigo and balance issues. My normally upbeat, energetic self was exhausted all the time. I couldn't seem to focus or get my mind together. My doctor finally mentioned MS for the first time. I didn't even know what it was, ""The disease Jerry Lewis does the telethon for?"" No, that's muscular dystrophy. She did some in office tests, made some referrals, nothing conclusive. November 2010 I passed out at work, and ended up not being able to return or work another job again. Still no official diagnosis or answers as to what was going on. To make matters worse, my doctor had received a once in a lifetime employment offer in another country and left. I had to find a new doctor. I am particular about who I let handle my health so I went through several, had to explain everything repeatedly, get puzzled looks. I started to think maybe I had become some crazy hypochondriac along the way. I was FINALLY diagnosed in March 2012. By then I had progressed to the point that I was sensitive to motion and could no longer drive. I started experiencing what I refer to as dead leg, and could not walk unassisted. I was first put on interferons and steroids, but I still progressed. I am now on Gilenya. I cannot sit upright too long without my back spasming. I cannot comprehend most conversation without being face to face so my mind can not only process the words, but body language and mannerisms as well. My limbs constantly have an achy, restless feeling to them. I will instantly forget where I am, what I'm doing, and sometimes even what month or time of year it is. I can't help but wonder, if I had never ignored my symptoms or took them more seriously, would I be where I am today? Could I have prevented becoming disabled? Could I still have a career and hobbies? If there is one thing I could share with the world, I would say: Don't ignore your body. You know best what is right and wrong. Don't be afraid or ashamed to tell your doctor. If you don't feel your doctor is helping, don't be afraid to get a new doctor. Don't stop until you have answers and a treatment plan that is working. You have so much you can lose if you don't love and take care of yourself. I am still fighting. It is a lot harder for me where I am at now, but I know it could get so much worse if I give up. Never give up on yourself.

I never received an email notification that someone had posted on this thread. I don't want to ho-hum your concerns. But do keep in mind that everything, even the common aspirin (see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0009123/?report=details#side_effects), has ""potential"" side effects and is contraindicated for some people. However, most people do not experience any of these. For those that do, the side effect is most typically minor. Should you encounter a side effect, simply stop taking it and the side effect goes away without any lasting issues. You are doing the right thing in questioning if it is contraindicated for you based on your current medications and medical history and consulting with your Internist. However, be aware that your Neuro and probably your Internist too will have no first hand knowledge on this medication. As for me, I can only relate my personal experience. I can point you to a number of clinical studies showing that the long term use of UDCA is well tolerated by most. Please have a look at the beginning of this clinical study of Ursodiol by Dr. Parry entitled ""Safety, Tolerability, and Cerebrospinal Fluid Penetration of Ursodeoxycholic Acid in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis"" which can be found at http://www.rattlebrain.com/~alsurso/Safety%20Tolerability%20Ursodeoxycholic%20Acid%202010.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4713362707750494433/Just-diagnosed-and-freaking-out---Multiple-Sclerosis---MedHelp	Just diagnosed and freaking out - Multiple Sclerosis - MedHelp	I am sorry that you are scared and freaking out. You are going through a difficult time right now so it is important to know that you are entitled to have a melt down before picking yourself back up and going forward. You are already taking great steps by reaching out and I know that you will find support and answers here that will help you when you need it most. I have received great support here so I speak from experience. My children were 2 & 5 when I first got sick and I thought I wouldn't be around to help them grow up. They are now 20 & 23 so have faith. As others have said, it could be worse (your dx). It does s*ck but you can now become involved and informed and be stronger for the battle. You will have great times in the future, not every day will feel scary. My biggest recommendation is that you get a neurologist that you like and respect. If you already have that fantastic! If not, once you have a chance to calm down and settle in it would be good to find one that you feel comfortable and confident with. It will make your treatment 10x better. Keep us posted on your progress & don't hesitate to reach out for help.

Years later, I had another episode of optic neuritis in my early 20s. I was referred to a neuro-opthamologist who suggested I may have MS. I underwent further investigations and was referred to an MS clinic and was followed by a neurologist for many years. In my mid 20s, I had a relapse where I had reduced sensation in my lower half of my body. My motor function was unaffected. A spine MRI confirmed lesions in my spinal cord, the brain MRI confirmed activity in the lesions. Mind you, there were changes in my brain MRI every year. I was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and was started on immunomodulator with anti-inflammatory properties, Aubagio. I suffered hair loss three months after I started on the medication. I am now married, and plan to start a family. I stopped taking aubagio and am currently on copaxone injections. 	1	1	Activity|Feed|-|MS|Connection	I|believe|i|had|optic|neuritis|when|I|was|a|teenager|,|and|at|the|time|I|was|not|diagnosed|with|MS|.|Years|later|,|I|had|another|episode|of|optic|neuritis|in|my|early|20s|.|I|was|referred|to|a|neuro-opthamologist|who|suggested|I|may|have|MS|.|I|underwent|further|investigations|and|was|referred|to|an|MS|clinic|and|was|followed|by|a|neurologist|for|many|years|.|In|my|mid|20s|,|I|had|a|relapse|where|I|had|reduced|sensation|in|my|lower|half|of|my|body|.|My|motor|function|was|unaffected|.|A|spine|MRI|confirmed|lesions|in|my|spinal|cord|,|the|brain|MRI|confirmed|activity|in|the|lesions|.|Mind|you|,|there|were|changes|in|my|brain|MRI|every|year|.|I|was|diagnosed|with|relapsing-remitting|multiple|sclerosis|(|RRMS|)|and|was|started|on|immunomodulator|with|anti-inflammatory|properties|,|Aubagio|.|I|suffered|hair|loss|three|months|after|I|started|on|the|medication|.|I|am|now|married|,|and|plan|to|start|a|family|.|I|stopped|taking|aubagio|and|am|currently|on|copaxone|injections|.

A new study has shown that drinking hot chocolate daily could help to reduce fatigue and tiredness among people suffering from MS (multiple sclerosis). The results of this new study were published in the latest issue of the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry . The team of researchers from Oxford Brookes University and the Univesity of Palermo, explain that cocoa contains flavonoids and these flavonoids are compounds that are well known antioxidants. These flavonoids reportedly help relieve tiredness and pain. Flavonoids are present in raw cacao and several other plant based foods. These also help in reducing inflammation. Image Credit: Shutterstock. MS is a severely debilitating and progressive disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. It leads to symptoms of vision problems, movement problems and alteration of sensation and balance. This new study was supported by the MS Society and in this 40 people with MS were included. The study was of six week duration. These patients all had the relapsing remitting form of the disease. They were divided into two groups. The first group was given a cup of cocoa which is rich in flavonoids while the other group received a different version of the drink with less amount of flavonoids. Results showed that those patients who were given the cocoa drink with higher amount of flavonoids felt less fatigued compared to the other group. Mood, cognitive performance as well as certain physical movements were improved with the flavonoid rich drink. There was a 45 percent improvement in the alertness of the participants and a 80 percent improvement in speed of walking the team reported. While the former was reported by the patients themselves, the latter was individually measured. Dr Shelly Coe, senior lecturer in nutrition at Oxford Brookes University in her statement said that the next step would to “to know exactly how effective flavonoid-rich hot chocolate is and whether it can benefit all people with MS before it's recommended.” Dr Susan Kohlhaas, director of research at the MS Society added, “We know fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of MS and it can have a huge impact on quality of life, so finding more comprehensive treatments that help is one of our top research priorities.”. Doctor Paolo Ragonese, of the University of Palermo in Italy summed up, “Our study establishes that the use of dietary interventions is feasible and may offer possible long-term benefits to support fatigue management, by improving fatigue and walking endurance. The use of dietary approaches to reduce fatigue and associated factors in people with MS may be an easy, safe, and cost-effective way to have an impact on quality of life and independence, allowing people to feel more in control of their condition. A full evaluation, including wider geography, longer follow up and cost effectiveness is now indicated.”. 	1	0	Cocoa|can|benefit|patients|with|multiple|sclerosis	Mar|6|2019|.|A|new|study|has|shown|that|drinking|hot|chocolate|daily|could|help|to|reduce|fatigue|and|tiredness|among|people|suffering|from|MS|(|multiple|sclerosis|)|.|The|results|of|this|new|study|were|published|in|the|latest|issue|of|the|Journal|of|Neurology|Neurosurgery|and|Psychiatry|.|The|team|of|researchers|from|Oxford|Brookes|University|and|the|Univesity|of|Palermo|,|explain|that|cocoa|contains|flavonoids|and|these|flavonoids|are|compounds|that|are|well|known|antioxidants|.|These|flavonoids|reportedly|help|relieve|tiredness|and|pain|.|Flavonoids|are|present|in|raw|cacao|and|several|other|plant|based|foods|.|These|also|help|in|reducing|inflammation|.|Image|Credit|:|Shutterstock|.|MS|is|a|severely|debilitating|and|progressive|disease|that|affects|the|brain|and|spinal|cord|.|It|leads|to|symptoms|of|vision|problems|,|movement|problems|and|alteration|of|sensation|and|balance|.|This|new|study|was|supported|by|the|MS|Society|and|in|this|40|people|with|MS|were|included|.|The|study|was|of|six|week|duration|.|These|patients|all|had|the|relapsing|remitting|form|of|the|disease|.|They|were|divided|into|two|groups|.|The|first|group|was|given|a|cup|of|cocoa|which|is|rich|in|flavonoids|while|the|other|group|received|a|different|version|of|the|drink|with|less|amount|of|flavonoids|.|Results|showed|that|those|patients|who|were|given|the|cocoa|drink|with|higher|amount|of|flavonoids|felt|less|fatigued|compared|to|the|other|group|.|Mood|,|cognitive|performance|as|well|as|certain|physical|movements|were|improved|with|the|flavonoid|rich|drink|.|There|was|a|45|percent|improvement|in|the|alertness|of|the|participants|and|a|80|percent|improvement|in|speed|of|walking|the|team|reported|.|While|the|former|was|reported|by|the|patients|themselves|,|the|latter|was|individually|measured|.|Dr|Shelly|Coe|,|senior|lecturer|in|nutrition|at|Oxford|Brookes|University|in|her|statement|said|that|the|next|step|would|to|“|to|know|exactly|how|effective|flavonoid-rich|hot|chocolate|is|and|whether|it|can|benefit|all|people|with|MS|before|it's|recommended|.|”|Dr|Susan|Kohlhaas|,|director|of|research|at|the|MS|Society|added|,|“|We|know|fatigue|is|one|of|the|most|common|symptoms|of|MS|and|it|can|have|a|huge|impact|on|quality|of|life|,|so|finding|more|comprehensive|treatments|that|help|is|one|of|our|top|research|priorities|.|”|.|Doctor|Paolo|Ragonese|,|of|the|University|of|Palermo|in|Italy|summed|up|,|“|Our|study|establishes|that|the|use|of|dietary|interventions|is|feasible|and|may|offer|possible|long-term|benefits|to|support|fatigue|management|,|by|improving|fatigue|and|walking|endurance|.|The|use|of|dietary|approaches|to|reduce|fatigue|and|associated|factors|in|people|with|MS|may|be|an|easy|,|safe|,|and|cost-effective|way|to|have|an|impact|on|quality|of|life|and|independence|,|allowing|people|to|feel|more|in|control|of|their|condition|.|A|full|evaluation|,|including|wider|geography|,|longer|follow|up|and|cost|effectiveness|is|now|indicated|.|”|.

Mar 5 2019 Reviewed by Kate Anderton, B.Sc. A new study has shown that drinking a cup of flavonoid-enriched cocoa each day could help to reduce fatigue in people suffering from multiple sclerosis. Kirill Z |. Daily consumption of the drink could be a convenient and safe way to alleviate the tiredness that affects 90% of people with multiple sclerosis, say the researchers. Multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative condition that affects more than 100,000 people in the UK alone and fatigue is one of the most challenging symptoms of the condition. Flavonoids , which are the antioxidants also found in fruit, vegetables and red wine, have previously been shown to have anti-inflammatory and free radical scavenging properties. Research has also linked flavonoid intake to health benefits such as improved heart and gut health and increased longevity. Furthermore, studies involving chronic fatigue sufferers have suggested that eating dark chocolate may boost energy levels. For the current study, Paolo Ragonese (University of Palermo in Italy) and team recruited 40 patients recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and gave them a cup of flavonoid-rich cocoa or a low-flavonoid version to drink every day for six weeks. As reported in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry , those who drank the high-flavonoid drink reported a 45% improvement in alertness levels and an 80% boost in walking speed, compared with the participants who were given the low-flavonoid drink. The researchers also found that those drinking the flavonoid-rich drink reported a reduction in pain symptoms. Ragonese says the study demonstrates that dietary interventions may offer possible long-term benefits to support fatigue management, by improving fatigue and walking endurance:. The use of dietary approaches to reduce fatigue and associated factors in people with MS may be an easy, safe, and cost-effective way to have an impact on quality of life and independence, allowing people to feel more in control of their condition.”. Paolo Ragonese, Author. Next, a full evaluation, including wider geography, longer follow up and cost-effectiveness is indicated, concludes Ragonese. 	1	0	Daily|cup|of|cocoa|may|reduce|tiredness|in|multiple|sclerosis	By|Sally|Robertson|,|B.Sc|.|Mar|5|2019|Reviewed|by|Kate|Anderton|,|B.Sc|.|A|new|study|has|shown|that|drinking|a|cup|of|flavonoid-enriched|cocoa|each|day|could|help|to|reduce|fatigue|in|people|suffering|from|multiple|sclerosis|.|Kirill|Z|||.|Daily|consumption|of|the|drink|could|be|a|convenient|and|safe|way|to|alleviate|the|tiredness|that|affects|90|%|of|people|with|multiple|sclerosis|,|say|the|researchers|.|Multiple|sclerosis|is|a|neurodegenerative|condition|that|affects|more|than|100,000|people|in|the|UK|alone|and|fatigue|is|one|of|the|most|challenging|symptoms|of|the|condition|.|Flavonoids|,|which|are|the|antioxidants|also|found|in|fruit|,|vegetables|and|red|wine|,|have|previously|been|shown|to|have|anti-inflammatory|and|free|radical|scavenging|properties|.|Research|has|also|linked|flavonoid|intake|to|health|benefits|such|as|improved|heart|and|gut|health|and|increased|longevity|.|Furthermore|,|studies|involving|chronic|fatigue|sufferers|have|suggested|that|eating|dark|chocolate|may|boost|energy|levels|.|For|the|current|study|,|Paolo|Ragonese|(|University|of|Palermo|in|Italy|)|and|team|recruited|40|patients|recently|diagnosed|with|multiple|sclerosis|and|gave|them|a|cup|of|flavonoid-rich|cocoa|or|a|low-flavonoid|version|to|drink|every|day|for|six|weeks|.|As|reported|in|the|Journal|of|Neurology|Neurosurgery|and|Psychiatry|,|those|who|drank|the|high-flavonoid|drink|reported|a|45|%|improvement|in|alertness|levels|and|an|80|%|boost|in|walking|speed|,|compared|with|the|participants|who|were|given|the|low-flavonoid|drink|.|The|researchers|also|found|that|those|drinking|the|flavonoid-rich|drink|reported|a|reduction|in|pain|symptoms|.|Ragonese|says|the|study|demonstrates|that|dietary|interventions|may|offer|possible|long-term|benefits|to|support|fatigue|management|,|by|improving|fatigue|and|walking|endurance|:|.|The|use|of|dietary|approaches|to|reduce|fatigue|and|associated|factors|in|people|with|MS|may|be|an|easy|,|safe|,|and|cost-effective|way|to|have|an|impact|on|quality|of|life|and|independence|,|allowing|people|to|feel|more|in|control|of|their|condition|.|”|.|Paolo|Ragonese|,|Author|.|Next|,|a|full|evaluation|,|including|wider|geography|,|longer|follow|up|and|cost-effectiveness|is|indicated|,|concludes|Ragonese|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4712559869044622158/Men-are-affected-by-kidney-failure-more-often-than-women,-new-analysis-shows	Men are affected by kidney failure more often than women, new analysis shows	Reviewed by James Ives, MPsych Feb 27 2019. Our kidneys filter out toxic waste from the blood and regulate the fluid balance in the body as well as the balance of electrolytes and acid/base amongst others. Kidneys are important organs whose functions most of us take for granted, but when kidneys silently stop working this can create a life threatening situation. Renal replacement therapy, RRT, (dialysis or kidney transplantation) may save the lives of many patients for years and even decades, as kidney function can be replaced by machines for a long period of time - but patients on dialysis (and transplanted patients to a lesser extent) have shorter life expectancies. This is why kidney failure (end-stage renal disease) should be prevented wherever possible. A new analysis of data in the ERA-EDTA Registry shows that men are affected by kidney failure much more often than women. In 2016, 26,446 men and 14,820 women started renal replacement therapy. Amongst older patients (>75 years of age), the difference was even more striking: the incidence in men was 2.7 times higher than that in women. 'One can only speculate about the reasons', explains Professor Ziad Massy (Paris), Clinical Nephrology Governance Chair/Chair of the Registry. The protective effects of oestrogens in women and/or the damaging effects of testosterone might cause kidney function to decline faster in men than in women. Moreover, elderly women seem to be more inclined to choose conservative care instead of RRT. However, hypertension or diabetes may also be implicated. There are distinct gender differences in the incidence and severity of hypertension. It is more common in men and could be prevented by lifestyle changes. 'You can reduce it to a simple formula', says Massy. `Beyond treatment, more sports and less body weight will result in lower blood pressure. The analysis also showed that the incidence of men starting renal replacement therapy due to diabetes and to glomerulonephritis/sclerosis was more than double that of their female counterparts. Again therapeutic strategies as well as lifestyle changes are available to optimize the control of diabetes. Finally, women are known to have better outcomes for some forms of glomerulonephritis, e.g. membranous (MGN) as well as focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which might explain why fewer women have to start dialysis because of these diseases. Additionally, Professor Massy adds, `if we want to reduce the incidence of chronic kidney disease in men, we should therefore concentrate on the early detection and control of these risk factors. Obviously, we need to broadcast these messages if we want to reduce the number of men who have to start dialysis'. 	0	0	Men|are|affected|by|kidney|failure|more|often|than|women|,|new|analysis|shows	Reviewed|by|James|Ives|,|MPsych|Feb|27|2019|.|Our|kidneys|filter|out|toxic|waste|from|the|blood|and|regulate|the|fluid|balance|in|the|body|as|well|as|the|balance|of|electrolytes|and|acid|/|base|amongst|others|.|Kidneys|are|important|organs|whose|functions|most|of|us|take|for|granted|,|but|when|kidneys|silently|stop|working|this|can|create|a|life|threatening|situation|.|Renal|replacement|therapy|,|RRT|,|(|dialysis|or|kidney|transplantation|)|may|save|the|lives|of|many|patients|for|years|and|even|decades|,|as|kidney|function|can|be|replaced|by|machines|for|a|long|period|of|time|-|but|patients|on|dialysis|(|and|transplanted|patients|to|a|lesser|extent|)|have|shorter|life|expectancies|.|This|is|why|kidney|failure|(|end-stage|renal|disease|)|should|be|prevented|wherever|possible|.|A|new|analysis|of|data|in|the|ERA-EDTA|Registry|shows|that|men|are|affected|by|kidney|failure|much|more|often|than|women|.|In|2016|,|26,446|men|and|14,820|women|started|renal|replacement|therapy|.|Amongst|older|patients|(|>|75|years|of|age|)|,|the|difference|was|even|more|striking|:|the|incidence|in|men|was|2.7|times|higher|than|that|in|women|.|'|One|can|only|speculate|about|the|reasons|'|,|explains|Professor|Ziad|Massy|(|Paris|)|,|Clinical|Nephrology|Governance|Chair|/|Chair|of|the|Registry|.|The|protective|effects|of|oestrogens|in|women|and|/|or|the|damaging|effects|of|testosterone|might|cause|kidney|function|to|decline|faster|in|men|than|in|women|.|Moreover|,|elderly|women|seem|to|be|more|inclined|to|choose|conservative|care|instead|of|RRT|.|However|,|hypertension|or|diabetes|may|also|be|implicated|.|There|are|distinct|gender|differences|in|the|incidence|and|severity|of|hypertension|.|It|is|more|common|in|men|and|could|be|prevented|by|lifestyle|changes|.|'|You|can|reduce|it|to|a|simple|formula|'|,|says|Massy|.|`|Beyond|treatment|,|more|sports|and|less|body|weight|will|result|in|lower|blood|pressure|.|The|analysis|also|showed|that|the|incidence|of|men|starting|renal|replacement|therapy|due|to|diabetes|and|to|glomerulonephritis|/|sclerosis|was|more|than|double|that|of|their|female|counterparts|.|Again|therapeutic|strategies|as|well|as|lifestyle|changes|are|available|to|optimize|the|control|of|diabetes|.|Finally|,|women|are|known|to|have|better|outcomes|for|some|forms|of|glomerulonephritis|,|e|.|g|.|membranous|(|MGN|)|as|well|as|focal|and|segmental|glomerulosclerosis|(|FSGS|)|,|which|might|explain|why|fewer|women|have|to|start|dialysis|because|of|these|diseases|.|Additionally|,|Professor|Massy|adds|,|`|if|we|want|to|reduce|the|incidence|of|chronic|kidney|disease|in|men|,|we|should|therefore|concentrate|on|the|early|detection|and|control|of|these|risk|factors|.|Obviously|,|we|need|to|broadcast|these|messages|if|we|want|to|reduce|the|number|of|men|who|have|to|start|dialysis|'|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4713085823808196516/Xconomy:-7-Tips-for-Biotech-Companies-Seeking-Capital-in-a-Volatile-Market	Xconomy: 7 Tips for Biotech Companies Seeking Capital in a Volatile Market	7 Tips for Biotech Companies Seeking Capital in a Volatile Market. Xconomy National —. Last year was a remarkable year for biotech companies going public. Not only did an unusually large number of biotech companies go public, but a significant number of early-stage biotech companies went public at premium valuations relative to their later-clinical stage peers. There were approximately 58 biotech IPOs in 2018 (excluding offerings with under $25 million of proceeds) for total gross proceeds of $6.3 billion [1], of which a significant number were early-stage companies — either in preclinical development or conducting ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials. Biotech IPO valuation trends have been strong year-over-year since 2015, and significantly more so among early-stage companies, which hit an all-time high in 2018 [2]. Despite the overall robust markets of 2018, early-stage biotech companies face a lengthy and highly uncertain road to an FDA-approved product, even with a favorable regulatory environment that is increasingly willing to accelerate approvals of innovative drugs. Aside from the challenge of demonstrating that their innovative science and technology has the potential to generate approvable drugs, these companies also face the significant challenge of financing what is, by all accounts, an extremely expensive development pathway. In 2019, early-stage public companies will face strong headwinds in accessing the significant capital that they require to successfully execute their development strategies. The large number of biotech IPOs in 2018 — and the anticipated number of private companies that will be looking to go public in 2019 — means that an ever-expanding list of public companies will be competing for limited investor attention and cash. There are also legitimate fears that the amount of such capital may contract in 2019. While 2018 was a very favorable environment for early-stage companies going public, the markets in the fourth quarter and the first weeks of 2019 have been significantly more volatile. All but two of the 58 biotech IPOs in 2018 priced prior to October 31, 2018 [3]. And by the end of the year, many of these newly public companies experienced significant drops in stock price as a result of macroeconomic factors, such as rising interest rates, which have led to a broad market sell-off. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) hit an all-time high in August, but October was its worst performing month (down 17 percent) since January 2016 [4]. More than half of the biotech companies that went public in 2018 are currently trading below issue price [5]. That trend is not new — several of the biggest biotech success stories have traded below their IPO price at one or more points along their development path — but the real possibility that conditions causing the current volatility may continue, or even increase, has many biotech executives looking nervously at their cash runway. That said, there remains reason for optimism. During a recent webinar hosted by WilmerHale and BIO , several industry experts noted that while there is no silver bullet to ensure success, early-stage public companies — both those that have recently gone public and those that aspire to go public in 2019 — can position themselves in ways that will maximize their ability to keep investors engaged over the long term and execute financings from a position of strength despite the headwinds. 1. Innovative ideas supported by strong and validated scientific rationales . No matter the market conditions, possessing groundbreaking data remains the golden ticket for an early-stage biotech company to access the markets at the time of their choosing. But, prior to receipt of data, early-stage companies can potentially garner great success in capital raising by relying on big ideas that offer the potential for major breakthroughs that could significantly impact patients. The 2018 IPO class had several of these big ideas, including early-stage companies with mRNA-based therapies, novel therapeutics delivery platforms, new gene therapies, and genetically-engineered T-cell therapies. That said, big ideas are good, but executives need to make sure those ideas are supported. In order to get traction with investors, innovative ideas that have not been proven in the clinic must have a strong scientific rationale and be validated by scientific leaders. It is essential for early-stage companies to establish and maintain relationships with key opinion leaders who are recognized experts in the relevant field or patient population. 2. Solid platform that serves as a foundation to produce clinical assets . The early-stage companies that command premium valuations are typically not one product or one indication companies – they are platform companies, based on interesting and innovative technology, with significant growth potential. One panelist, Ricky Sun, a partner with Bain Capital Life Sciences, described the ideal platform as a “flywheel” that can produce multiple clinical assets based on the same underlying science or technology. This enables companies to build a flexible and scalable modular platform that serves as a foundation for targeting new indications in a cost-efficient manner. A scientifically valid and cost-efficient platform helps de-risk the investment in minds of investors. A solid platform can also provide opportunities for creative collaborations with deep-pocketed partners, which can enable companies to get non-dilutive capital and outside help to maximize the potential of their platform. 3. Communication and results on the path to validation . It is essential for early-stage companies to identify their major value inflection points – where they can present data that is meaningful to the scientific community, the clinical community, and investors — and to generate that news flow to keep investors interested in the stock. According to Terry-Ann Burrell, managing director of the Healthcare Investment Banking Group at J.P. Morgan, major catalysts will ideally be nine to 12 months after the IPO rather than the usual 12 to 18 months, giving investors the timely opportunity to assess their investment decisions and, ideally, confirm their support. Companies that have flexibility in the timing of the IPO have the benefit of planning ahead for the first major announcement as a public company. Only real data events will attract the interest of investors. (Fluff does not work.) And the importance of this factor is magnified in volatile markets. Jeff Urlich, a managing director of Health Care at Cowen, noted that it is very difficult to get investors to pay attention and evaluate new investment opportunities when volatility spikes and as a result, in 2019, companies may have a higher bar and fewer opportunities to get the attention of investors. Companies that set clear value inflection points and deliver on those will be best positioned to capitalize. 4. Employ credible management teams with a strong track record . A major building block for a successful early-stage company is its management team. According to Kyle Kuvalanka, a financing consultant and life sciences executive, the best early-stage companies have a management team with a track record of operational excellence that can build an organization with a full set of capabilities to research, develop, and advance product candidates through clinical trials and into the marketplace. Investors will also look for management teams that have demonstrated that they can build investor syndicates and will be able to effectively raise the capital needed to execute their development strategies. 5. Credible initial backers offer cash and validation . Early-stage companies that have a pre-IPO shareholder base consisting of recognized investment firms, or pharmaceutical companies with a track record of supporting companies, will have two key benefits: (i) sufficient cash to execute financings from a position of strength, both in terms of pricing and aftermarket support, and with optionality as to timing of financings, and (ii) key validation of the investment thesis. These benefits may signal to prospective investors that the company will be financially supported through its development cycle, including through more challenging markets. 6. Post-IPO cash management is key. A critically important, but often overlooked, aspect of success after an IPO is strong cash management. Companies aiming for success should strive to have 12 to 18 months of cash beyond their major inflection points. As Ms. Burrell remarks, while managing dilution is important, strong investors are playing for the long game. Companies need to be willing to look beyond short-term dilution and set themselves up for success by raising and maintaining enough cash to bring them beyond those key inflection points. Managing your cash and taking the long view in terms of what is best for the company gives you optionality, both in terms of when you raise capital and with whom. 7. Consider strategic collaborations . Collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies can provide cash and valuable external validation of a company and its technology. Executing a deal that provides significant upfront investment while retaining rights and control of key product candidates substantiates both the validity of the science and management’s capabilities to execute complex transactions. Collaborations can also serve as an attractive source of capital in unfavorable equity markets or when the company is between major catalysts. Management should ensure that they have a business development team that is constantly looking for opportunities, building relationships, and raising awareness of the company’s technology and progress. As Mr. Kuvalanka stressed, successful collaborations often take about 18 months from inception to close, so if a need for capital arises, it is essential to have established relationships that foster discussions to shorten that path. Like raising capital, executing a deal from a position of strength will be far more effective than trying to execute when the chips are down. Strategic collaborations are likely be very attractive to companies looking for funding in 2019 as an alternative to capital markets transactions. Pharmaceutical companies may also be more active in making investments if continued volatility leads to more challenging valuations. Having all of these elements of success does not guarantee that companies will be able to raise money with ease, but big ideas, broad platforms, effective and timely communications, experienced and well-respected management teams with meaningful relationships, and the flexibility that comes along with a strong balance sheet will certainly help keep early-stage biotech companies moving at full capacity through volatile markets.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4712207349687306498/Study-shows-major-gaps-in-communication-between-hospital-and-home-health-care-clinicians	Study shows major gaps in communication between hospital and home health care clinicians	"Reviewed by James Ives, MPsych Feb 26 2019. CU Anschutz researchers say this can lead to potentially deadly medical errors. A survey of Colorado home health care clinicians (HHCs) revealed that 60 percent said they had not received enough information to guide patient treatment while 52 percent said patients often had unrealistic expectations of the kind of care they would receive. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, also showed major gaps in communication between hospital and home health care staff, some that could have serious medical consequences. The study was published today in the Journal of the American Medical Directors Association . ""We have heard of medication errors occurring between hospitals and home health care providers,"" said the study's lead author Christine D. Jones, MD, MS, assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. ""As a result, patients can receive the wrong medication or the wrong dose. Some home health providers don't get accurate information about how long to leave a urinary catheter or intravenous line in."" Jones and her colleagues surveyed nurses and staff at 56 HHC agencies throughout Colorado. Participants were sent a 48-question survey covering communication between hospitals and HHCs, patient safety, pending tests, medication schedules, clinician contact and other areas. More than half said hospitals did not adequately prepare patients for home health care upon discharge. They also said patients often expected a level of home care that was simply not available including extended hours, housekeeping and help with transportation. Home health care workers with access to electronic health records (EHRs) for referring providers had fewer problems relating to a lack of information about patients, including critical medication data. They were able to electronically access notes, orders, lab and radiology results and referrals. Some 12 percent of respondents reported positive experiences when accessing the Colorado Regional Health Information Organization (CORHIO, http://www. org) about hospital admissions. Yet many did not have access to such information. ""Although almost all (96 percent) indicated that Internet-based access to a patient's hospital record would be at least somewhat useful,"" Jones said. ""Fewer than half reported having access to EHRs for referring hospitals or clinics."" She said the survey revealed problems getting medication doses right due to conflicting information. ""Notably, additional studies have found extremely high rates of medication discrepancies (94 percent - 100 percent) when referring provider and HHC medications lists are compared,"" Jones said. The study suggested targeted education of hospital staff about what home health clinicians actually provide to patients and caregivers to avoid frustration. Jones noted that if these issues are arising in Colorado, they could signify a national problem. ""For hospitals and HHC agencies seeking strategies to improve communication, this study can provide targets for improvement,"" she said. ""Future interventions to improve communication between the hospital and HHC should aim to improve preparation of patients and caregivers to ensure they know what to expect from HHC and to provide access to EHR information for HHC agencies.""

Elizabeth Delacruz can't crawl or toddle around like most youngsters nearing their second birthday. A rare metabolic disorder that decimated her mobility has also led to cortical blindness - her brain is unable to process images received from an otherwise healthy set of brown eyes. And multiple times a day Elizabeth suffers seizures that continually reduce her brain function. She can only offer an occasional smile or make soft bubbly sounds to communicate her mood. ""But a few months ago I heard her say, 'Mama,' and I started to cry,"" said Carmen Mejia, a subtle quaver in her voice as she recalled the joy of hearing her daughter. ""That's the first time she said something."" Ms. Mejia realizes it may also be the last, unless doctors can find a way to detect and prevent the epileptic seizures stemming from a terminal disease called pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency (PDHD) - which occurs when mitochondria don't provide enough energy for the cells. A UT Southwestern study gives parents like Ms. Mejia renewed hope for their children: By monitoring the brain activity of a specific cell type responsible for seizures, scientists can predict convulsions at least four minutes in advance in both humans and mice. The research further shows that an edible acid called acetate may effectively prevent seizures if they are detected with enough notice. Although the prediction strategy cannot yet be used clinically - a mobile technology for measuring brain activity would have to be developed - it signifies a potential breakthrough in a field that had only been able to forecast seizures a few seconds ahead. ""Many of the families I meet with are not just bothered by the seizures. The problem is the unpredictability, the not knowing when and where a seizure might occur,"" said Dr. Juan Pascual, a pediatric neurologist with UT Southwestern's O'Donnell Brain Institute who led the study published in Science Translational Medicine . ""We've found a new approach that may one day solve this issue and hopefully help other scientists track down the root of seizures for many kinds of epilepsy."" The critical difference between the study and previous efforts was debunking the long-held belief among researchers that most cells in epilepsy patients have malfunctioning mitochondria. In fact, Dr. Pascual's team spent a decade developing a PDHD mouse model that enabled them to first discover the key metabolic defect in the brain and then determine only a single neuron type was responsible for seizures as the result of the metabolic defect. They honed in on these neurons' electrical activity with an electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect which brainwave readings signaled an upcoming seizure. ""It's much more difficult to predict seizures if you don't know the cell type and what its activity looks like on the EEG,"" Dr. Pascual said. ""Until this finding, we thought it was a global deficiency in the cells and so we didn't even know to look for a specific type."" The study shows how a PDHD mouse model helped scientists trace the seizures to inhibitory neurons near the cortex that normally keep the brain's electrical activity in check. Scientists then tested a method of calculating when seizures would occur in mice and humans by reviewing EEG files and looking for decreased activity in energy-deficient neurons. Their calculations enabled them to forecast 98 percent of the convulsions at least four minutes in advance. Dr. Pascual is hopeful his lab can refine EEG analyses to extend the warning window by several more minutes. Even then, live, clinical predictions won't be feasible unless scientists develop technology to automatically interpret the brain activity and calculate when a seizure is imminent. Still, he said, the discovery that a single cell type can be used to forecast seizures is a paradigm-shifting finding that may apply to all mitochondrial diseases and related epilepsies. Dr. Pascual's ongoing efforts to extend the prediction time may be a crucial step in utilizing the other intriguing finding from the study: the use of acetate to prevent seizures. The study showed that delivering acetate into the blood stream of PDHD mice gave their neurons enough energy to normalize their activity and decrease seizures for as long as the acetate was in the brain. However, Dr. Pascual said the acetate would probably need more time - perhaps 10 minutes or more - to take effect in humans if taken by mouth. Acetate, which naturally occurs in some foods, has been used in patients for decades - including newborns needing intravenous nutrition or patients whose metabolism has shut down. But it had not yet been established as an effective treatment for mitochondrial diseases that underlie epilepsy. Among the reasons, Dr. Pascual said, is that labs have struggled to create an animal model of such diseases to study its effects; his own lab spent about a decade doing so. Another is the widespread acceptance of the ketogenic diet to reduce the frequency of seizures. But amid a growing concern about potentially unhealthy side effects of ketogenic diets, Dr. Pascual has been researching alternatives that may refuel the brain more safely and improve cognition. Elizabeth, among a handful of patients whose EEG data were used in the new study, has been prescribed a ketogenic diet and some vitamins to control the seizures. Her family has seen little improvement. Elizabeth often has more than a dozen seizures a day and her muscles and cognition continue to decline. She can't hold her head up and her mother wonders how many more seizures her brain can take. Elizabeth was only a few months old when she was diagnosed with PDHD, which occurs when cells lack certain enzymes to efficiently convert food into energy. Patients who show such early signs often don't survive beyond a few years. Ms. Mejia does what she can to comfort her daughter, with the hope that Dr. Pascual's work can someday change the prognosis for PDHD. Ms. Mejia sings, talks, and offers stuffed animals and other toys to her daughter. Although her little girl can't see, the objects offer a degree of mental stimulation, she said. ""It's so hard to see her go through this,"" Ms. Mejia said. ""Every time she has a seizure, her brain is getting worse. I still hope one day she can get a treatment that could stop all this and make her life better."" 'Big questions'. Dr. Pascual is already conducting further research into acetate treatments, with the goal of launching a clinical trial for patients like Elizabeth in the coming years. His lab is also researching other epilepsy conditions - such as glucose transporter type I (Glut1) deficiency - to determine if inhibitory neurons in other parts of the brain are responsible for seizures. If so, the findings could provide strong evidence for where scientists should look in the brain to detect and prevent misfiring neurons. ""It's an exciting time, but there is much that needs to happen to make this research helpful to patients,"" Dr. Pascual said. ""How do we find an automated way of detecting neuron activity when patients are away from the lab? What are the best ways to intervene when we know a seizure is coming? These are big questions the field still needs to answer.""

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4710096562908122942/New-optimization-method-rapidly-analyzes-nanomedicines-for-cancer-treatment	New optimization method rapidly analyzes nanomedicines for cancer treatment	"Reviewed by James Ives, MPsych Feb 20 2019. With their ability to treat a wide a variety of diseases, spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) are poised to revolutionize medicine. But before these digitally designed nanostructures can reach their full potential, researchers need to optimize their various components. A Northwestern University team led by nanotechnology pioneer Chad A. Mirkin has developed a direct route to optimize these challenging particles, bringing them one step closer to becoming a viable treatment option for many forms of cancer, genetic diseases, neurological disorders and more. ""Spherical nucleic acids represent an exciting new class of medicines that are already in five human clinical trials for treating diseases, including glioblastoma (the most common and deadly form of brain cancer) and psoriasis,"" said Mirkin, the inventor of SNAs and the George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry in Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. A new study published this week in Nature Biomedical Engineering details the optimization method, which uses a library approach and machine learning to rapidly synthesize, measure and analyze the activities and properties of SNA structures. The process, which screened more than 1,000 structures at a time, was aided by SAMDI-MS technology, developed by study co-author Milan Mrksich, Henry Wade Rogers Professor of Biomedical Engineering in Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and director of the Center for Synthetic Biology. Invented and developed at Northwestern, SNAs are nanostructures consisting of ball-like forms of DNA and RNA arranged on the surface of a nanoparticle. Researchers can digitally design SNAs to be precise, personalized treatments that shut off genes and cellular activity, and more recently, as vaccines that stimulate the body's own immune system to treat diseases, including certain forms of cancer. SNAs have been difficult to optimize because their structures -- including particle size and composition, DNA sequence and inclusion of other molecular components -- can vary in many ways, impacting or enhancing their efficacy in triggering an immune response. This approach revealed that variation in structure leads to biological activities showing non-obvious and interdependent contributions to the efficacy of SNAs. Because these relationships were not predicted, they likely would have gone unnoticed in a typical study of a small set of structures. For example, the ability to stimulate an immune response can depend on nanoparticle size, composition and/or how DNA molecules are oriented on the nanoparticle surface. ""With this new information, researchers can rank the structural variables in order of importance and efficacy, and help establish design rules for SNA effectiveness,"" said Andrew Lee, assistant professor of chemical and biological engineering in the McCormick School of Engineering and study co-author. ""This study shows that we can address the complexity of the SNA design space, allowing us to focus on and exploit the most promising structural features of SNAs, and ultimately, to develop powerful cancer treatments,"" said Mirkin, who is also director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology.

Zhang applied for funding four or five times over several years, to no avail. “It felt quite lonely,” he says. “But I just felt this is very unique stuff. And it may become a big thing.”. Pulling funds from other projects and from the start-up package he received to set up his lab at the University of California, San Diego, Zhang did the experiments for his breakthrough paper, published in 2011 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . He and coworkers created a new class of nanoparticles , made from carbon-containing polymers, that could slip through blood vessels in a mouse without triggering an immune reaction. While immune responses are important for killing disease-causing pathogens, the same reactions are a nuisance when they clear out molecules made to deliver lifesaving drugs. Then, instead of just viewing their particles as a drug-delivery system, which most other researchers were focused on, Zhang and his team made a surprising pivot. They repurposed the particles to act as “nanosponges” that trap and remove toxins from the blood. In lab experiments, the nanosponges worked against toxins unleashed by E. coli and some of the harder-to-fight bacteria. Nanosponges also slowed harmful inflammation in mice with a form of rheumatoid arthritis and diverted HIV and Zika from the cells those viruses normally infect, the researchers reported last year. Nanosponges, which have not yet been tested in people, do their under-the-radar cleanup because of an offbeat idea: The synthetic nanoparticles are coated with membranes from living cells, which helps them blend in. And a single nanosponge can root out a slew of mischief-makers without knowing much about them individually. Many toxins that attack red blood cells, for example, will cling instead to nanoparticles coated with bits of those very cells. Zhang’s team at UC San Diego and others have created a growing arsenal of nanosponges cloaked in membranes of red or white blood cells, each of which absorbs its own set of toxins. Zhang’s work “opened up the whole field” of membrane-coated nanoparticles, says Omid Farokhzad, a physician-scientist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who studies nanoparticles as medicine ( SN: 11/11/16, p. 22 ). Many labs are now “building on the platform that Zhang’s group developed.”. When Zhang was a postdoc at MIT more than a decade ago, nanoparticle research was all about drug delivery. In 1995, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first nanotherapy, which carried an anticancer drug. Since then, about 50 other nanodrugs, for treating cancer, hemophilia, multiple sclerosis and other diseases, have made their way into patient care . Nanoparticles are about one three-thousandth the size of red blood cells, yet each tiny particle can carry thousands of drug molecules. To get a drug where it needs to go, nanoparticles must hide from the immune system. When immune cells encounter foreign material — even nano-sized stuff — the cells try to destroy the invader and remove it from the body. Nanomedicine researchers thought they’d found a solution by coating their particles with a clear, thick liquid called polyethylene glycol, or PEG. Immune cells would “see” the particles as water and not react, Zhang says. Yet PEG was not ideal. More than a decade ago, patient studies began to reveal that PEG-coated particles can cause people to produce antibodies against PEG, which can trigger unwelcome immune responses. Other approaches, such as outfitting particles with a “don’t eat me” protein that tumor cells use to avoid immune attacks, haven’t worked either. Then Zhang had a flash of insight: “How about disguising the particles as if they belong in the body?”. Trained as a chemical engineer, Zhang was not bound by many biologists’ need to figure out what is going on. “Engineers want to get it done. We want to make it work,” he says. “After making it work, then we may study the reasons.”. The concept of cloaking a human-made particle with bits of unpredictable biological membranes “was very unorthodox” at the time, recalls Che-Ming Jack Hu, the graduate student in Zhang’s lab who took on the project. Today, Hu heads his own nanotechnology lab at Academia Sinica in Taipei City, Taiwan. “People didn’t know what to make of the idea.” But Hu, a bioengineer, found the notion of mixing natural and synthetic materials exciting. Protect and repair. To keep the immune system off guard, Zhang and Hu set out to disguise the particles in membranes from circulating red blood cells. Early experiments were nightmarish. “The lab was just setting up. We didn’t have a lot of resources,” Hu recalls. He needed blood from mice, but the group didn’t yet have approval to purchase animals. The researchers turned to neighboring labs. “We’d tell them, ‘If you’re going to kill those mice, can we take some of their blood?’ ” Hu says. Drawing blood from the animals was not easy for Hu and coworkers, who were used to dealing with chemicals and polymers. “All of a sudden, we were taking these dead mice and sticking a syringe into the heart to take their blood,” he says. At first “we got very little.” Mouse blood, the team learned, clots quickly. With practice, the researchers were soon collecting a milliliter of blood from each mouse. Hu separated out the red blood cells, stripped their membranes, then nudged the membrane pieces onto nanoparticles. Each milliliter of blood contained some 5 billion red blood cells, and a cut-up membrane from a single red blood cell could coat several thousand nanoparticles. Injected into live mice, the hybrid particles spread through the body and stayed intact for three days. “We kind of got lucky,” Hu says of those early efforts. Soon after, a team at the Houston Methodist Research Institute in Texas reported a similar feat, coating nanoparticles with the membranes of white blood cells of the immune system. Like the UC San Diego group, the Houston researchers felt they were going out on a limb by mixing synthetic particles with parts of live cells. “People in the nano field were telling me I was crazy,” says nanoengineer Ennio Tasciotti, the team leader. Tasciotti’s group covered its particles with membranes from various kinds of white blood cells, or leukocytes. The particles “were look-alikes of a leukocyte,” Tasciotti quips. Leukocytes are expert scavengers that take “the VIP path” to go wherever the infection or foreign invader is, Tasciotti says. When leukocytes touch down on the surface of blood vessels, the lining opens to allow the cells to enter. The “leukolike” particles could avoid attack by macrophages, which gobble up foreign substances, the researchers showed in a set of experiments published in 2012. The researchers used the particles to carry a cancer drug across a layer of endothelial cells, which make up the lining of blood vessels. Tasciotti’s team has since replaced synthetic nanoparticles with natural ones , made from thin sheets of fat cells that form spherical blobs called liposomes, the researchers reported in 2016 in Nature Materials . With no artificial parts, Tasciotti says, his leukocyte-coated liposomes, or “leukosomes,” so far tested in lab animals, could face an easier path to FDA approval for use in patients. Even when the leukosomes weren’t carrying a drug, they interacted with living tissues in helpful ways, Tasciotti says. In 2017 in Nanoscale , he and colleagues reported that leukosomes could relieve inflammation and help repair damaged tissue in the gastrointestinal tract of mice that had a form of inflammatory bowel disease. While the Houston team and other labs were tinkering with nanoagents to deliver cancer drugs and heal tissues, Zhang ventured into infectious diseases. As he and Hu brainstormed uses for their membrane-coated particles, they came upon a key realization. Unlike PEG-coated nanoparticles that just sneak through the body, Zhang and Hu’s nanoparticles are enclosed within biological membranes from cells that normally interact with tissues and with a plethora of chemical messengers and molecules in the body. Perhaps, then, these interactive membrane-coated particles could put up a fight against toxins, the biological weapons of pathogens. In 2011, as antibiotic resistance was gaining recognition as a serious public health threat, Zhang learned about pore-forming toxins. These small proteins are released by many pathogens, including MRSA, the strain of Staphylococcus aureus that resists most antibiotics. Many of these toxins puncture and kill red blood cells, Zhang says. Some researchers were taking aim at particular toxins by developing antibodies, specialized proteins produced by immune cells to recognize and bind to specific foreign objects. To Zhang, aiming at one type of toxin at a time seemed tedious. Toxins could come from various sources — MRSA, other bacteria, even animal venom. If a single drug could counteract all the toxins, Zhang says, “that would be really cool.”. Puzzling over this possibility, Zhang and Hu saw new potential in their nanocreations. Rather than merely acting as camouflage for the nanoparticles, the red blood cell membranes might be able to trap toxins. Toxins “like to poke holes in red blood cells,” Hu says. But if toxins go after the nanoparticles, the toxins “get stuck” on the nanoparticles’ membranes and can no longer harm cells. Instead, the troublemakers are carried to the liver and broken down. Toxins (purple) kill blood cells by attaching to and puncturing the cells’ surface (left). Nanosponges protect the blood cells by ensnaring the toxins (right). Toxins destroy blood cells Nanosponges protect blood cells. Vaccinating mice with red blood cell nanoparticles protected the animals from toxins produced by MRSA and showed potential to protect against toxins from E. coli , poisonous snakes and bees, the UC San Diego team reported in 2013 in Nature Nanotechnology . Zhang, Hu and colleagues have since expanded their collection of nanosponges to include particles covered in membranes from three types of white blood cells — macrophages, neutrophils and T cells. In a 2017 mouse study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , macrophage-coated particles trapped and rendered powerless some of the molecules that drive inflammation leading to sepsis, an uncontrolled response to infection that kills about 6 million people worldwide each year . Last September, the team reported in Nature Nanotechnology that neutrophil nanosponges sop up toxins that cause rheumatoid arthritis in mice. And in lab dish experiments reported in November in Advanced Materials , nanosponges coated with T cells diverted HIV from actual T cells, the cells this virus typically attacks, eventually causing AIDS. “It’s a very versatile approach,” says Ankur Singh, a bioengineer at Cornell University. “You don’t have to synthesize a new class of materials each time. You could in principle go with an FDA-approved [particle] and put different cell membranes on the surface.”. The list of nanosponges being tested in lab dishes and mouse studies is growing. Here are some targets being explored. The type of nanosponge coating is in parentheses. * Sepsis (red blood cell, macrophage). * Skin and soft tissue. infection (red blood cell). But he raises a possible caution with the studies targeting rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease. Neutrophil membranes often contain proteins called autoantigens, which cause an immune reaction. If such membranes are used to coat nanoparticles, some autoantigens could exacerbate unwanted immune processes that drive rather than fight disease. Further experiments should test diverse patient tissues, Singh suggests. For now, Cellics Therapeutics, a San Diego–based biotech start-up that Zhang cofounded in 2014, hopes to launch a patient study with the red blood cell nanosponges. Sepsis and pneumonia top the list of about a dozen conditions that could make good targets for the nanosponges. But the road to FDA approval is uncertain. “It remains challenging to develop even the simplest of nanoparticles,” says Farokhzad at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Particles with human and synthetic components add “enormously to the complexity of the system,” he says. “But you’re also adding enormously to the promise of the system.”. Today, Hu’s group in Taiwan is taking the nanosponge concept in a new direction. The researchers made nanoparticles coated with membranes from red blood cells and used the particles to trap influenza viruses . The method, reported in 2017 in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces , might one day improve diagnosis of influenza and other viral infections. “If you think of biological processes — how cells communicate, how viruses infect cells — all these things happen at the nanoscale,” Hu says.

I had some minor issues with Copaxone, but not the hives that you had. With Ocrevus I've had zero problems, but know another MSer who has had about every possible side effect while on Ocrevus (but she still uses it). As far as effectiveness as a DMT goes, Ocrevus and Tysabri are at the top of the list (someone correct me if I'm wrong). Both are worth bringing up with your neurologist. And FWIW, this doctor has a bunch of videos up about the various DMTs (and MS in general) that are worth checking out. 	1	1	Discussions|-|MS|Connection	Mar|06|,|2019|6:44|PM|.|New|Medication|*|.|Mar|09|,|2019|7:44|AM|.|I|had|some|minor|issues|with|Copaxone|,|but|not|the|hives|that|you|had|.|With|Ocrevus|I've|had|zero|problems|,|but|know|another|MSer|who|has|had|about|every|possible|side|effect|while|on|Ocrevus|(|but|she|still|uses|it|)|.|As|far|as|effectiveness|as|a|DMT|goes|,|Ocrevus|and|Tysabri|are|at|the|top|of|the|list|(|someone|correct|me|if|I'm|wrong|)|.|Both|are|worth|bringing|up|with|your|neurologist|.|And|FWIW|,|this|doctor|has|a|bunch|of|videos|up|about|the|various|DMTs|(|and|MS|in|general|)|that|are|worth|checking|out|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4714787168432994469/Australian-women-urged-to-increase-physical-activity-and-prevent-chronic-disease	Australian women urged to increase physical activity and prevent chronic disease	Mar 5 2019. To mark International Women’s Day on Friday 8 March, the Australian Physiotherapy Association (APA) is urging Australian women to place higher priority on their physical and mental health and wellbeing. Too often women put their own needs on hold as they juggle family responsibilities - including caring for children and elderly parents - work responsibilities and social commitments. A recent health report has found that less than half of women aged 18–64 exercised at the recommended level of at least 150 minutes over five or more sessions each week. Regular physical activity is an important contributor to good health; it promotes healthy weight maintenance, reduces the risk of chronic disease and improves mental function and general feelings of wellbeing. Cath Willis, chair of the APA Women’s, Men’s and Pelvic Health group, says that physical activity is an incredibly powerful tool for optimizing whole body health in the long term and should be seen as an investment into women’s future health and wellbeing. “Exercise is a critical component of disease prevention, but chronic conditions such as being overweight or obese, incontinence or leakage, endometriosis, low back pain and mental health issues may be a barrier.”. “A well-trained women’s health physiotherapist can help women manage these concerns and barriers to exercise and provide guidance on the right type of exercise for individual circumstances.”. Australian women are more likely than men to suffer from depression, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, arthritis and dementia, all of which have been linked to sedentary behaviors. With increasing age, women are also more likely to experience multiple chronic conditions simultaneously; 87 per cent of women over 65 currently live with at least one chronic disease. Ms. Willis said that while physiotherapy can play a critical role in treating, motivating and giving confidence to women to be more active through various forms of sport and exercise, many women were simply not aware how it could help with their concerns. “Physiotherapy helps keep women moving when they are in pain or lack confidence in their bodies, and this has enormous flow-on effects to their quality of life, both physical and emotional. I want women to know that urinary incontinence in particular should not be seen as normal, and that physio can make a big difference to how you feel and therefore how active you can be.”. 	0	0	Australian|women|urged|to|increase|physical|activity|and|prevent|chronic|disease	Mar|5|2019|.|To|mark|International|Women|’|s|Day|on|Friday|8|March|,|the|Australian|Physiotherapy|Association|(|APA|)|is|urging|Australian|women|to|place|higher|priority|on|their|physical|and|mental|health|and|wellbeing|.|Too|often|women|put|their|own|needs|on|hold|as|they|juggle|family|responsibilities|-|including|caring|for|children|and|elderly|parents|-|work|responsibilities|and|social|commitments|.|A|recent|health|report|has|found|that|less|than|half|of|women|aged|18|–|64|exercised|at|the|recommended|level|of|at|least|150|minutes|over|five|or|more|sessions|each|week|.|Regular|physical|activity|is|an|important|contributor|to|good|health|;|it|promotes|healthy|weight|maintenance|,|reduces|the|risk|of|chronic|disease|and|improves|mental|function|and|general|feelings|of|wellbeing|.|Cath|Willis|,|chair|of|the|APA|Women|’|s|,|Men|’|s|and|Pelvic|Health|group|,|says|that|physical|activity|is|an|incredibly|powerful|tool|for|optimizing|whole|body|health|in|the|long|term|and|should|be|seen|as|an|investment|into|women|’|s|future|health|and|wellbeing|.|“|Exercise|is|a|critical|component|of|disease|prevention|,|but|chronic|conditions|such|as|being|overweight|or|obese|,|incontinence|or|leakage|,|endometriosis|,|low|back|pain|and|mental|health|issues|may|be|a|barrier|.|”|.|“|A|well-trained|women|’|s|health|physiotherapist|can|help|women|manage|these|concerns|and|barriers|to|exercise|and|provide|guidance|on|the|right|type|of|exercise|for|individual|circumstances|.|”|.|Australian|women|are|more|likely|than|men|to|suffer|from|depression|,|osteoporosis|,|sarcopenia|,|arthritis|and|dementia|,|all|of|which|have|been|linked|to|sedentary|behaviors|.|With|increasing|age|,|women|are|also|more|likely|to|experience|multiple|chronic|conditions|simultaneously|;|87|per|cent|of|women|over|65|currently|live|with|at|least|one|chronic|disease|.|Ms|.|Willis|said|that|while|physiotherapy|can|play|a|critical|role|in|treating|,|motivating|and|giving|confidence|to|women|to|be|more|active|through|various|forms|of|sport|and|exercise|,|many|women|were|simply|not|aware|how|it|could|help|with|their|concerns|.|“|Physiotherapy|helps|keep|women|moving|when|they|are|in|pain|or|lack|confidence|in|their|bodies|,|and|this|has|enormous|flow-on|effects|to|their|quality|of|life|,|both|physical|and|emotional|.|I|want|women|to|know|that|urinary|incontinence|in|particular|should|not|be|seen|as|normal|,|and|that|physio|can|make|a|big|difference|to|how|you|feel|and|therefore|how|active|you|can|be|.|”|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4714850574375069077/Cohen-testimony:-Bad-move-by-GOP,-parading-black-woman-to-defend-Trump	Cohen testimony: Bad move by GOP, parading black woman to defend Trump	Mark Meadows put a black woman on display to show Trump is not a racist. Bennie Ivory Opinion contributor. Published 7:00 AM EST Mar 5, 2019. News flash for Rep. Mark Meadows: If you are going to play the race card, own it. Don’t try to run away from it. That’s exactly what the Republican congressman from North Carolina tried to do during the House’s Michael Cohen hearing last week after trotting out a black woman in front of the cameras for all of the world to see to defend President Donald Trump against charges of racism. It was an obscenely insulting and surreal scene reminiscent of another place in time when slaves were put on display on the auction block for inspection. A scene devastatingly unbecoming the halls of Congress. Read more commentary:. Impeachment or pre-impeachment, the Trump accountability era is here. Cohen only flipped because he got caught. That's all we can expect in the Trump era. Cohen testimony was a WWE body slam against Trump. Here's why it's credible. Curiously, the woman, Lynne Patton, stood silently as a Meadows told committee members that she would never work for a racist. We can only assume that he was paraphrasing her sentiments because she didn’t utter a word. (For the record, Ms. Patton has worked for the Trump Organization and now for the current administration as an official for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. She disputes that she was Meadows' prop.). All in the spirit of proving that Donald Trump isn’t racist. One single black woman versus a mounting body of incontrovertible evidence of Trump’s blatant racist behavior. Did Meadows ask a black 'friend' for advice? Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., called him out on the tactic, Meadows apparently feigned righteous indignation and accused her of calling him a racist, which she didn’t. News flash, Meadows: You don’t get to define what racism is and isn’t. He then resorted to emotional blackmail by invoking his friendship with committee chairman Elijah Cummings, D-M.D., who is black. There was more. He went on to claim deniable plausibility of his own racism by saying that some members of his own family are people of color — a fact he said not many people know about. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., with Lynne Patton in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 27, 2019. Two more news flashes: One, I’ve got cheese in my refrigerator, but I don’t like cheese, and, two, you don’t get to define what racism is and isn’t. Meadows, did it cross your mind that your ploy with Patton might at least be inappropriate and rub some people the wrong way? Did you ask Patton or one of your black friends or your family members of color? Just asking. And, Meadows, did you consider what you were doing when you bought into the birther movement apparently questioning the citizenship and legitimacy of Barack Obama, the nation’s first African-American president? Did you think that spurious or fake claim might raise its head one day? No righteous indignation here, please. It’s on videotape. Racism isn't always dressed in Klan robes. Then again, maybe you weren’t feigning righteous indignation at all. Maybe you really thought you had done nothing wrong and that you indeed had become the victim. Which would make your actions even more egregious. And truly sad in 2019. If so, you would fall into the ranks of too many Americans who don’t understand the complexities of race and racism. Too many people think a racist is someone who goes around casually spewing the n-word and hiding under white robes and pointy hoods. For sure, that’s one category of racism. But racism also can be subtle, so subtle that you don’t recognize it even when it’s in plain sight. Or maybe never. It can reside in board rooms and in much, much higher places. But regardless of the form it takes, there is no place in society for racism on any level. Certainly not in Congress and the highest office in the land. As Cummings said at the end of the Cohen hearing, we are better than this. Yes, we are... but it’s hard to tell some days.

Credit: Cincinnati Children's. CINCINNATI--Faster results. Lower costs. Fewer cells. A new mathematical method developed by researchers at Cincinnati Children's and New York University may soon make it much easier to conduct more of the complex data analysis needed to drive advances in the exploding field of personalized medicine. Proof-of-principle results for the method are reported this month in Genome Research . The co-authors say they were able to use vastly less biological material to reproduce--and even expand upon--an expensive previous effort to identify a network of protein transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the function of T Helper 17 (TH17) cells, an immune cell type that defends against bacterial and fungal infections but also can lead to autoimmune diseases when malfunctioning. The learnings regarding TH17 cells are significant in their own right, researchers say. The data adds several TFs to the known transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) that controls how TH17 cells behave. This, in years to come, could lead to better treatments for autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. However, this discovery's potential impact may reach much further. ""This method could be applied to any cell type, and could provide new information on how targeted cell types could be controlled in a wide range of diseases,"" says Emily Miraldi, PhD , a computational biologist at Cincinnati Children's and lead author on the new study. In years to come, detailed knowledge about the TRNs controlling specific cell types could help researchers find precise ways to ramp up immune system responses to attack cancer tumors or tamp down responses to treat a variety of immune diseases, Miraldi says. From 10-million-cell samples to as few as 500. Using current methods, researchers have learned much about how gene expression can differ among healthy and unhealthy people. But learning how to safely influence gene expression to improve health involves drilling deeper into how TRNs orchestrate behavior in specific cell types, locations and conditions. In many diseases, especially rare ones, it can be difficult to impossible to gather enough cells of interest to conduct such analyses, Miraldi says. For example, detailing the initial regulatory network for TH17 cells relied on data from chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), a breakthrough technology introduced about a decade ago. But that tool requires as many as 10 million cells to work. The methods used by Miraldi and colleagues produced similar results with 100 times fewer cells. In fact, in some cases, data could potentially be obtained from samples with as few as 500 cells. In the new approach, the research team used an improved version of a gene expression modeling algorithm called ""Inferelator"" that integrates data from a newer technique called assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). ATAC-seq zeroes in only on the portions of chromatin--the long, coiled strands of DNA within each cell--that are ""open"" for transcription factors to bind. ""ATAC-seq is a possible alternative to multiple ChIP-seq experiments. I call it a poor man's ChIP-seq,"" Miraldi says. Analysis of ATAC-seq information required several other tools as well, including a massive database (CisBP) of transcription factor binding preferences for thousands of transcription factors. The CisBP database was assembled by a team led by Cincinnati Children's computational biologist Matthew Weirauch, PhD. If the upgraded Inferelator algorithm proves as useful as hoped, it could help reduce some of the need for animal research. Instead of spending months raising hundreds of carefully gene-modified mice to produce an adequate supply of a targeted cell type, it may become possible to obtain valid results using cell samples from as few as two or three mice, Miraldi says. More study needed to apply and improve the new method. Miraldi and colleagues have already begun pursuing two lines of study related to this discovery. One project applies the new method to construct TRNs for intestinal immune cells in vivo. Another project seeks to refine the new method so that it can be applied to even smaller samples, such as those isolated from human patients using single-cell genomics.

Just a quick question, has anyone out there been on both Tysabri and Ocrevus? Which one worked better for you? I'm hesitant to try Tysabri due to the risk of PML, but it seems to have fewer side effects and has been out for a while now. On the flip side, Ocrevus seems to have more side effects but less serious ones and hasn't really been out long enough to see long term effects. And yes, I know that these DMT's affect everyone differently. I was just looking for some opinions.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4714494633056124748/Post-op-complication:-bladder-rupture---Prostate-Cancer	Post-op complication: bladder rupture - Prostate Cancer	"Posted Yesterday 8:35 PM (GMT -6). A belated but much appreciated thanks for the discussion. The surgeon isn't admitting it was iatrogenic. He believes it is too distant from the procedure (Nov 7, LARP -> Feb 24, Bladder emergency). However, I believe it started before. At the 6 wk point after surgery I asked the surgeon if I could resume exercising and he said yes, ""it's six weeks"" (last week in Dec.) I decided to wait two more weeks until mid-January before resuming back and ab exercises. On January 17 I noticed all my surgical incisions were weeping clear liquid and my mid-abdomen had swelled and was inflamed. At the same time I had a dermatological outbreak with blisters on all my limbs. I assumed it was an allergic reaction but my allergist had me see a dermatologist immediately. The Derm had a biopsy to test for all types of viruses and autoimmune disease. As the biopsy showed nothing she gave me antibiotics and that stopped the inflammation but not the dermatological outbreak. I contact the LAPR surgeon and he looked at the photos and said it was dermatological and awaited the biopsy for confirmation. Since the surgery wounds had dried-up I too assumed it was dermatological. The dermatologist wasn't so sure. She said the secondary dermatological blisters all over my body could be an ""id reaction"" also known as an autoeczematization in response to the original surgical wound outbreak. After my bladder rupture, the surgeons in the hospital wanted to know about the dermatological blisters and had the hospitals dermatologist (actually resident) examine me and he came to the same conclusion: it was an id reaction. The mechanism for an id reaction isn't known but if the original disturbance is removed, the skin clears up--which it did. Thus, the bladder was leaking for at least a month from Jan 17 to Feb 24 when I went to the emergency room. Clearly the 1.5 liters of urine that they removed from the abdomen had been collecting for some time. The timeline looks like a continuum, not a delayed reaction after 4 months. I suspect it was iatrogenic but perhaps it was a nick. Might it not even self-cured at first, as muscles tend to do? Perhaps a resumption of exercise interrupted that process? In any case I find it hard to believe that the bladder just ruptured. Of course, there's always a possibility of another disease.

I went to my primary doctor a couple of years ago because I was having issues with my balance (if I lose my balance I have no chance of correcting myself so I fall), intermittent double vision, dizziness, horrible muscle cramps (where it feels like my bones are breaking) and memory/word finding issues. She did a bunch of tests and found that my B12 level was at a critical low so I was put on replacement. My B12 levels are now much higher so well within therapeutic levels. She had me see a neurologist who ordered a bunch more tests including MRI, auditory/vertigo and neuropsych testing. He also found that I have neuropathy in my hands and feet. I have tremors in my left hand from time to time where it's tough to hold onto anything because it's shaking so bad. Fast forward to a month or so ago I was at work and the left side of my face, hand/arm and trunk went numb and tingly so much so that I thought for sure I had a left sided facial droop but nope. I couldn't feel what was in my left hand but yet I was. I went to the ER after this happened intermittently for a couple of weeks, each episode lasting anywhere from a few moments to an hour and a half. CT and MRI were clean, no lesions again. I had a follow-up with the neurologist and she tried to say it was ""brain irritation"" and wanted to give me a medication to treat my migraines (I don't have migraines anymore, no aura, no visual change, no headache, nothing). I contacted the patient advocate and got someone to finally listen to me because after reviewing my records they were incomplete and/or incorrect. She asked if I'd been to the MS clinic yet, I told her no because they keep saying that it's not MS. Just had SSEP and VEP testing this past Thursday with follow up on the 11th. The technician told me that they were getting ""informative results"" during the leg portions of the SSEP testing, it was giving me full body jerks which started on the side the stimulator was on and the whole time I was hearing her click click click during it. I feel like I'm going nuts waiting on the next appointment and hopefully this time the doctor will actually listen to me and not write me off like I'm losing my mind. Has anyone else had similar reaction to the SSEP testing? Mar 04, 2019 9:37 AM. Hello grebelmn,. I hope that your doctors are closer to finding out what is causing your symptoms with this additional testing. If you think that it may be MS, here is some information about possible MS and diagnosing MS that may be helpful. If you have other questions or concerns, give us a call at 1.800.344.4867 (M-F 7am-5pm MST) and ask to speak with an MS Navigator. Stephanie, MS Navigator.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4713508431991206013/GC-MS-in-Biomedicine	GC-MS in Biomedicine	By Sara Ryding Reviewed by Liji Thomas, MD. GC-MS is a combination of gas chromatography, a separation technique, and mass spectrometry, which is used to identify analytes. This detection technique has extensive applications in biomedicine, including disease diagnosis, pharmaceutical quality control, and metabolic profiling. Olena Yakobchuk |. GC-MS is a technique used for analysis of volatile and semi-volatile compounds. Gas chromatography is a potent separation technique capable of separating compounds in gaseous form. GC can identify substances based on their retention time, but these can be inaccurate and therefore misleading. GC itself is not enough to confidently identify the separated compounds, which is the reason for the use of mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry identifies analytes based on their mass, or their m/z (mass to charge ratio). Typically, GC-MS utilizes electron impact and chemical ionization techniques. Overall, GC-MS confers several advantages, such as faster analysis, improved confidence in analyte identification, and better sensitivity for compounds that are otherwise hard to analyze. GC-MS for disease diagnosis. GC-MS is particularly useful in the diagnosis of disease as it can identify compounds in fluids such as urine and blood. Diseases which might otherwise have been difficult to detect, such as congenital disease, benefit particularly from this as it can be applied to samples of amniotic fluid. In this situation, GC-MS offers a highly accurate diagnosis of conditions that could be very relevant during childbirth or critical postnatal periods. GC-MS can be used to detect disease states based on abnormal levels of compounds in bodily fluids. For example, deficiencies in cholesterol synthesis can lead to Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLO), which can be detected using GC-MS, which shows increased levels of 7-dehydrocholestrol in blood and tissues. The technique has also been used to identify the biomarkers of pulmonary tuberculosis present in the human breath. This biomarker test was capable of distinguishing between healthy individuals and those with suspected infection, and between infected and noninfected patients. GC-MS in metabolomics. GC-MS can be used to detect and characterize metabolic imbalances in adults and juveniles. Urine tests performed at birth can inform healthcare personnel of metabolic diseases at an early stage. These include the inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) which affect around 1 in 200 infants. An IEM is caused by loss or gain of function of one or more mutant proteins, and the GC-MS metabolite analysis can identify a number of the abnormalities resulting from the enzyme dysfunction. GC-MS techniques can be used to detect over 130 different metabolic disorders, such as methylmalonic aciduria, propionic acidemia, and isovaleric aciduria. GC-MS can also be used to characterize metabolic activity, and shows if an abnormal metabolic profile has been acquired. The metabolic process can be isotopically labeled, typically with 13 C, and the ratios of 13C-12C are usually measured with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. This type of mass spectrometer is used to measure only a number of chosen ions and gives the values in the form of ratios. The use of GC-MS in the analysis of bodily fluids has certain disadvantages, too. For example, repeatedly injecting bodily fluids into a gas chromatographer can result in an involatile residue, which may decompose during later analysis. Furthermore, GC-MS is ideal for volatile metabolites, but is less ideal for non-volatile metabolites with high molecular mass. Drug development and production. GC-MS is of great use in drug development, as it forms an important aspect of medicinal chemistry. It can be used to characterize leading candidate compounds which should be further followed up in the process of drug development and the search for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). GC-MS can be used to analyze drug behavior during a clinical trial. Pharmacokinetics (the study of how pharmaceuticals move around the body), and pharmacodynamics (the study of how the drug’s effect and how they work) can be studied using GC-MS. For example, GC-MS has been used to determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of capsules of vitamin K in human plasma. GC-MS has a prominent role in quality control of pharmaceuticals. It can be used to separate components of pharmaceuticals and identify them because of its ability to characterize compounds. Any impurities will therefore be identified and can be removed. As such, GC-MS has a role in the process and method development in pharmaceutical production as well as in testing stability of pharmaceuticals.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4713499287570072203/A-New-Study-Looks-at-Why-the-Immune-System-Attacks-Myelin	A New Study Looks at Why the Immune System Attacks Myelin	"The holy grail of curing multiple sclerosis (MS) seems best described as finding the cause of MS, which will enable scientists to identify the appropriate treatment and even, possibly, the way to prevent it from occurring in the first place. So far, the cause of MS is unknown. To quote from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society’s statement on what causes multiple sclerosis :. “The cause of MS is not known. Scientists believe MS is triggered by a combination of factors. To identify the cause, research is ongoing in areas of immunology (the study of the body’s immune system), epidemiology (the study of disease patterns in large groups of people) and genetics (understanding the genes that may not be functioning correctly in people who develop MS). Scientists are also studying infectious agents that may play a role."" But now, scientists report they may be getting closer to understanding what sets off MS . Molecular Mimicry May Be Behind the Immune System Attack. The new research builds on an earlier study. In a paper published in June 2013 in Science Translational Medicine , researchers from Germany, Switzerland, and the United States described how they desensitized the immune system to myelin to keep it from attacking that fatty neuron sheath. Last month, news broke about the results of further studies by a group of those researchers. The study — reported in a 58-page scientific paper — suggests that there are myelin-like pieces of protein (actually peptides, which are protein building blocks made of amino acids) on or in viruses and bacteria. This has become known as molecular mimicry, and it may be the reason the body’s immune system attacks myelin. Put simply, a virus or bacteria that has invaded the body may have a part of it that is similar to a part of a protein found in myelin. When the immune system attacks to clear the foreign invader from the body, it also attacks the myelin. The immune system is a smart weapon, but it may be being fooled by similarities in uniform between enemy and good guy. Genetic Variances May Make Myelin More or Less Susceptible. At this early juncture, it looks like there are more than one or two bits of myelin that have quite a few protein pieces that are similar to a good number of viruses and bacteria. It’s possible that genetics play a part in this process, as each person’s myelin is slightly different, based on genes. One person’s slight genetic variance may leave their myelin more susceptible to mimicry, thus more susceptible to autoimmune attack leading to MS. If this avenue of “cause” turns out to be correct, it may be possible for researchers to create a tolerance for these peptides though a procedure called immunotolerance therapy. It’s something of a reverse vaccine. Rather than building up immunity to something by weaponizing the immune system against it, immunotolerance therapy is sort of like introducing allergens in small, controlled amounts to reduce allergic reactions. Immunotolerance Therapy for MS? Time Will Tell! There’s a long way to go before we can expect to see immunotolerance therapy in the clinical setting. That researchers got from research point A to point B in this line of thinking in just five years is, however, promising. Who knows, perhaps those being diagnosed with MS today will have their own myelin peptides turned into a kinder, gentler way to modulate the immune system and keep it from attacking. Fingers crossed!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4711365029728741225/MS-Views-and-News:	MS Views and News:	Don't sip. Drink a small glass of water (about 6 to 8 ounces) all at once every few hours during the day. That's better than sipping drinks constantly, which might make you want to pee more often. You'll know when you get enough to drink because your urine will turn light yellow. Stop drinking before bed. Stay hydrated, but don't drink too close to bedtime or you could wake up during the night to use the bathroom. Have your last drink of water or other fluid at least 2 hours before you go to bed. Limit caffeine and alcohol. Cut back on coffee, soda, beer, and wine. Caffeine and alcohol can irritate your bladder and increase the urge to go. Alcohol also affects the way your kidneys absorb water, and it can make your bladder fill up more quickly than usual. Don't smoke. Nicotine is another bladder irritant. If you smoke, ask your doctor for advice on nicotine replacement products, medicines, and other methods to help you quit. Do Kegel exercises . Just like you tone your biceps and triceps, you can strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that support your bladder. These muscles hold urine in your bladder so it won't leak when you sneeze, cough, or laugh. To find the right muscles, squeeze like you would to stop the flow of urine, hold for about 4 seconds, then release. Do these exercises a few times each hour. You don't have to set aside a special place or time. Do them wherever and whenever you like. If you have trouble finding your pelvic floor muscles, ask a nurse or physical therapist for help. Retrain your bladder. Go to the bathroom on a regular schedule, such as every 2 hours. Do it even if you don't feel like you need to. That way you'll prevent your bladder from filling up too much and overflowing. If you feel the urge to pee before the full 2 hours are up, try to hold it in for just 5 minutes more by tightening your pelvic floor muscles. Over time, you should be able to have longer and longer periods of time between bathroom visits. 	0	0	MS|Views|and|News|:	Don't|sip|.|Drink|a|small|glass|of|water|(|about|6|to|8|ounces|)|all|at|once|every|few|hours|during|the|day|.|That's|better|than|sipping|drinks|constantly|,|which|might|make|you|want|to|pee|more|often|.|You'll|know|when|you|get|enough|to|drink|because|your|urine|will|turn|light|yellow|.|Stop|drinking|before|bed|.|Stay|hydrated|,|but|don't|drink|too|close|to|bedtime|or|you|could|wake|up|during|the|night|to|use|the|bathroom|.|Have|your|last|drink|of|water|or|other|fluid|at|least|2|hours|before|you|go|to|bed|.|Limit|caffeine|and|alcohol|.|Cut|back|on|coffee|,|soda|,|beer|,|and|wine|.|Caffeine|and|alcohol|can|irritate|your|bladder|and|increase|the|urge|to|go|.|Alcohol|also|affects|the|way|your|kidneys|absorb|water|,|and|it|can|make|your|bladder|fill|up|more|quickly|than|usual|.|Don't|smoke|.|Nicotine|is|another|bladder|irritant|.|If|you|smoke|,|ask|your|doctor|for|advice|on|nicotine|replacement|products|,|medicines|,|and|other|methods|to|help|you|quit|.|Do|Kegel|exercises|.|Just|like|you|tone|your|biceps|and|triceps|,|you|can|strengthen|the|pelvic|floor|muscles|that|support|your|bladder|.|These|muscles|hold|urine|in|your|bladder|so|it|won't|leak|when|you|sneeze|,|cough|,|or|laugh|.|To|find|the|right|muscles|,|squeeze|like|you|would|to|stop|the|flow|of|urine|,|hold|for|about|4|seconds|,|then|release|.|Do|these|exercises|a|few|times|each|hour|.|You|don't|have|to|set|aside|a|special|place|or|time|.|Do|them|wherever|and|whenever|you|like|.|If|you|have|trouble|finding|your|pelvic|floor|muscles|,|ask|a|nurse|or|physical|therapist|for|help|.|Retrain|your|bladder|.|Go|to|the|bathroom|on|a|regular|schedule|,|such|as|every|2|hours|.|Do|it|even|if|you|don't|feel|like|you|need|to|.|That|way|you'll|prevent|your|bladder|from|filling|up|too|much|and|overflowing|.|If|you|feel|the|urge|to|pee|before|the|full|2|hours|are|up|,|try|to|hold|it|in|for|just|5|minutes|more|by|tightening|your|pelvic|floor|muscles|.|Over|time|,|you|should|be|able|to|have|longer|and|longer|periods|of|time|between|bathroom|visits|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4711719250838794668/Decline-in-Brain-Volume-Driven-by-Gray-Matter-Atrophy-in-MS-Patients-Despite-Tysabri-Treatment	Decline in Brain Volume Driven by Gray Matter Atrophy in MS Patients Despite Tysabri Treatment	BY JONATHAN GRINSTEIN. This finding points to new markers for MS disease progression, and the need to monitor the effectiveness of treatment using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The research article, Gray matter atrophy in multiple sclerosis despite clinical and lesion stability during natalizumab treatment ,” was published in the journal PLOS ONE . Brain volume loss is an important marker for assessing atrophy and disability in MS patients. However, the contribution of gray and white matter to whole brain volume loss in MS warrants further examination. Additionally, there is a need to identify markers to assess the effectiveness of known disease-modifying treatments so that MS patients can receive optimal care. Brain atrophy measurements, both global and regional (whole and partial), assess net tissue damage, reflecting the sum of demyelination — damage to the protective coat (called myelin) that surrounds nerve fibers — and injury and loss of brain cells. Global brain atrophy has predictive importance for MS disease progression, while regional brain atrophy is a more sensitive and reliable indicator of disease status. # Tysabri , marketed by # Biogen , is a monoclonal antibody that has potent anti-inflammatory effects, and is able to reduce relapses and disability progression in patients with relapsing-remitting #MS ( RRMS ). :::::::. 	1	0	Decline|in|Brain|Volume|Driven|by|Gray|Matter|Atrophy|in|MS|Patients|Despite|Tysabri|Treatment	BY|JONATHAN|GRINSTEIN|.|This|finding|points|to|new|markers|for|MS|disease|progression|,|and|the|need|to|monitor|the|effectiveness|of|treatment|using|magnetic|resonance|imaging|(|MRI|)|.|The|research|article|,|Gray|matter|atrophy|in|multiple|sclerosis|despite|clinical|and|lesion|stability|during|natalizumab|treatment|,|”|was|published|in|the|journal|PLOS|ONE|.|Brain|volume|loss|is|an|important|marker|for|assessing|atrophy|and|disability|in|MS|patients|.|However|,|the|contribution|of|gray|and|white|matter|to|whole|brain|volume|loss|in|MS|warrants|further|examination|.|Additionally|,|there|is|a|need|to|identify|markers|to|assess|the|effectiveness|of|known|disease-modifying|treatments|so|that|MS|patients|can|receive|optimal|care|.|Brain|atrophy|measurements|,|both|global|and|regional|(|whole|and|partial|)|,|assess|net|tissue|damage|,|reflecting|the|sum|of|demyelination|—|damage|to|the|protective|coat|(|called|myelin|)|that|surrounds|nerve|fibers|—|and|injury|and|loss|of|brain|cells|.|Global|brain|atrophy|has|predictive|importance|for|MS|disease|progression|,|while|regional|brain|atrophy|is|a|more|sensitive|and|reliable|indicator|of|disease|status|.|#|Tysabri|,|marketed|by|#|Biogen|,|is|a|monoclonal|antibody|that|has|potent|anti-inflammatory|effects|,|and|is|able|to|reduce|relapses|and|disability|progression|in|patients|with|relapsing-remitting|#MS|(|RRMS|)|.|::|:|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4710671149015396478/Love-Conquers-All:-An-MS-Story---Blog---MS-Society-of-Canada	Love Conquers All: An MS Story - Blog - MS Society of Canada	At some point in their lives, nearly half of Canadians aged 15 and older have provided care to a family member or friend with a long-term health condition, disability, or aging need. Libby and Grant Sanderson have been married for 36 years and are no exception. When Libby was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1990, their world turned upside down. Grant is now Libby’s caregiver and helps her with everyday activities as well as runs a support group at the MS Society of Canada. Today, Libby and Grant are stronger than ever and have agreed to share with us their story and how they have persevered through it all. What was your initial reaction when you found out about your MS diagnosis? Libby: I had been experiencing numbness for a while, so when I first received my diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), I can’t say I was surprised. The worst part had always been not knowing what was wrong with me, so it was a relief when I was finally diagnosed. At least they had a name for this thing going on with me. Photos by Kristen McLean and Christian Henriquez from Northern Alberta Institute of Technology Photography. When I told my friends and family, they were understanding and supportive. I experienced the same thing with my mother when she was diagnosed with lupus. Nobody sat me down to explain what my mom’s medical situation was and I wish they had, so I wanted to handle the situation differently. Grant: When I first found out that my wife was diagnosed with MS, I broke out into tears. I remembered all the horror stories I heard in the past, and it terrified me. Although I was afraid, I knew it was better to know what we were facing. It’s easier knowing what it is so we can deal with it and hope to conquer it. For the first four or five years, Libby didn’t have many symptoms. She would get flare-ups, which would have major impacts on her lifestyle. She couldn’t walk or talk at times. How did your family take the news? G: We have two children. Our son Dana is 31 and our daughter Kerrie is 29. I think our daughter took the diagnosis very hard. Growing up, teenage girls fight with their mothers about the smallest things. This was more amplified with Libby’s MS because she couldn’t do everything on her own. She couldn’t walk or talk at times, and sometimes, I would have to remind her that she can’t do everything by herself. I think Kerrie resented that her mom has MS. This was tough for a young girl, but now her thoughts are changed. I think we are all learning to let go of our expectations. What have been some of the largest obstacles you have faced as a result of your MS? L: MS has cut down on our ability to travel anywhere we want, even in the city. Not everywhere is wheelchair accessible. G: The past eight years have been the most challenging. Libby has experienced a decline in cognition, as well as physical capabilities, which increased her dependence on others. Her short-term memory has significantly faded and her ability to follow cooking recipes has declined. Libby used to have excellent cooking skills, but MS has taken that away. Additionally, some of the people she used to socialize with have stopped communicating with her. Due to a decrease in her cognitive abilities, she does not use a computer or a smart phone, and her lack of access to social media makes socializing more challenging. How did you first come to be involved with the MS Society? L: We initially became involved with the MS Society through participating in support groups. G: The meetings provide a social outing for people impacted by MS. Libby developed friends through this group. We have now been doing the MS Walk for 25 years! I recently began leading one of the local volunteer support groups as a facilitator. I think it is important you get involved with what your family is doing. If it helps support Libby and others, it is an added bonus. I know first-hand what it is like to live with someone living with MS. It can be hard to explain the idiosyncrasies that the illness goes through, so I feel that I can help others experiencing the same thing. These support groups are also continuing to provide a social outing for people impacted by MS. For Libby, this was her group of friends she developed. How has MS affected you as a caregiver? G: MS affects more than just the person living with MS. As a caregiver you also take on a level of responsibility. People often ask, “How is your wife doing?” but rarely ask, “How are you doing?” It can be hard and depressing and people don’t always think about asking the caregiver. If you could tell other supportive spouses one thing, what would you say? G: Learn about MS. If Libby starts doing something or loses ability to do something you realize it is the MS doing it. It’s not her being silly; it is the MS that impacts her. Sometimes Libby will ask the same question repeatedly – you have to find the patience. She’s not doing it to annoy me, but because she doesn’t remember. You have to answer it as though it is the first time and not the thirty-first time. Patience is a big thing! Find someone to lean on and speak with to discuss the challenges you are facing. We hope that Grant and Libby’s story has provided some comfort to others who may be facing similar experiences. The bond between a person with a chronic disease such as MS and the person, who provides care, can be very strong and positive. At the same time, caregiving can also be physically and emotionally demanding and exhausting. If you’re looking for additional information and support, the 1:1 Caregiver Peer Support Program offers support and comfort for caregivers of those living with MS.

Brain mri with contrast cake back no lesions? My dr said not ms if I have no brain lesions. All symptoms point to ms. Been checked for lymes disease and I do not have that. Can a spinal tap show me where a brain mri didn’t? Feb 14, 2019 2:47 PM. Hello thefoxyroxy,. I am sorry that you have not been able to find answers from your doctor about what is definitively causing your symptoms yet. I included some information from our website about not having a brain lesion on your MRI that I think will be helpful:. You can read more about MRIs by clicking on this link. Below are other links that may be useful regarding the diagnostic criteria for MS and lumbar punctures:. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). Please give us a call at 1.800.344.4867 (M-F 7am-5pm MST) if you have any additional questions. Stephanie, MS Navigator. Feb 14, 2019 5:30 PM. 🌻🌻🌻🌻Glad that no lesions. 😊😊😊. 😊❤️❤️❤️❤️✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼 Might be hel. ful to read the MS information.👍👍👍👍👍 But do what you n. ed to do to rule out other diagnoses 👍👍👍👍👍 get/keep copies of ALL. reports, ask for discs, tests. You might want a secon. opinion later on✌🏼😊❤️ Youll get there, keep sm. ling ✌🏼❤️😊✌🏼❤️😊✌🏼❤️😊✌🏼❤️😊 Feb 14, 2019 8:45 PM lovereign w. ote: A spinal tap/lu. bar puncture would be the next best step in the diagnosing process. The doctor should have also done. an MRI with contrast of your cervical and thoracic spine. I've heard some people with MS o. ly have lesions on their spine and not on their brain. However, I learned from my neuro. yesterday that MRIs of the spine are typically only done when you are having issues with your gait, balance, and/or bladder and bowel dysfunction. So if you are, I would request a. spine MRI as well. Crazy cuz yes I’m having crazy h. ir balance and leg issues. So frustrating he didn’t order t. e full mri! I’m going in for lumbar spine du. k fusion on the 21st and am scared to death about how this will effect me. I have no idea how I’ll recover. hen my body feels like it’s moving with cement surrounding it. 	1	1	Discussions|-|MS|Connection	Feb|13|,|2019|7:49|PM|.|Question|~|Brain|mri|with|contrast|came|back|no|lesions|?|*|.|Brain|mri|with|contrast|cake|back|no|lesions|?|My|dr|said|not|ms|if|I|have|no|brain|lesions|.|All|symptoms|point|to|ms|.|Been|checked|for|lymes|disease|and|I|do|not|have|that|.|Can|a|spinal|tap|show|me|where|a|brain|mri|didn|’|t|?|Feb|14|,|2019|2:47|PM|.|Hello|thefoxyroxy|,|.|I|am|sorry|that|you|have|not|been|able|to|find|answers|from|your|doctor|about|what|is|definitively|causing|your|symptoms|yet|.|I|included|some|information|from|our|website|about|not|having|a|brain|lesion|on|your|MRI|that|I|think|will|be|helpful|:|.|You|can|read|more|about|MRIs|by|clicking|on|this|link|.|Below|are|other|links|that|may|be|useful|regarding|the|diagnostic|criteria|for|MS|and|lumbar|punctures|:|.|Cerebrospinal|Fluid|(|CSF|)|.|Please|give|us|a|call|at|1.800.344.4867|(|M-F|7am|-|5pm|MST|)|if|you|have|any|additional|questions|.|Stephanie|,|MS|Navigator|.|Feb|14|,|2019|5:30|PM|.|🌻|🌻|🌻|Glad|that|no|lesions|.|😊|😊|😊|.|😊|❤|️|❤|️|❤|️|❤|️|✌|🏼|✌|🏼|✌|🏼|✌|🏼|Might|be|hel|.|ful|to|read|the|MS|information|.|👍|👍|👍|But|do|what|you|n|.|ed|to|do|to|rule|out|other|diagnoses|👍|👍|👍|get|/|keep|copies|of|ALL|.|reports|,|ask|for|discs|,|tests|.|You|might|want|a|secon|.|opinion|later|on|✌|🏼|😊|❤|️|Youll|get|there|,|keep|sm|.|ling|✌|🏼|❤|️|😊|✌|🏼|❤|️|😊|✌|🏼|❤|️|😊|✌|🏼|❤|️|😊|Feb|14|,|2019|8:|45|PM|lovereign|w|.|ote|:|A|spinal|tap|/|lu|.|bar|puncture|would|be|the|next|best|step|in|the|diagnosing|process|.|The|doctor|should|have|also|done|.|an|MRI|with|contrast|of|your|cervical|and|thoracic|spine|.|I've|heard|some|people|with|MS|o|.|ly|have|lesions|on|their|spine|and|not|on|their|brain|.|However|,|I|learned|from|my|neuro|.|yesterday|that|MRIs|of|the|spine|are|typically|only|done|when|you|are|having|issues|with|your|gait|,|balance|,|and|/|or|bladder|and|bowel|dysfunction|.|So|if|you|are|,|I|would|request|a|.|spine|MRI|as|well|.|Crazy|cuz|yes|I|’|m|having|crazy|h|.|ir|balance|and|leg|issues|.|So|frustrating|he|didn|’|t|order|t|.|e|full|mri|!|I|’|m|going|in|for|lumbar|spine|du|.|k|fusion|on|the|21st|and|am|scared|to|death|about|how|this|will|effect|me|.|I|have|no|idea|how|I|’|ll|recover|.|hen|my|body|feels|like|it|’|s|moving|with|cement|surrounding|it|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4707064973175589096/Mayim-Bialik-says-United-Airlines-crew-shut-boarding-door-'in-my-face'	Mayim Bialik says United Airlines crew shut boarding door 'in my face'	"Mayim Bialik rants against United Airlines crew for shutting boarding door 'in my face'. David Oliver and Leora Arnowitz USA TODAY. Published 11:11 AM EST Feb 11, 2019. Mayim Bialik has a few words for United Airlines. And they aren't happy ones. ""The Big Bang Theory"" actress tweeted Sunday night that a flight attendant shut the boarding gate in her face. ""To the @UnitedAirlines flight attendant who shut the boarding gate in my face,"" Bialik wrote. ""I made my connecting flight in Houston. it was a tight squeeze but You said there were plenty of open seats. when you saw my carry on suitcase you said there was no room and shut the door in my face."" She followed up with several additional tweets about her experience. The mom-of-two said five other passengers were let on the plane while she was left behind. She tweeted she had purchased a first-class seat but would have happily sat in economy class if it meant making her flight. ""And also why couldn’t my little suitcase somehow fit? Maybe the first class seat I was supposed to sit in could have held it and I would have gladly sat in all of the open seats anywhere on that plane."" On Instagram, she expanded on what happened, saying the experience left her near tears. ""Maybe she hates the ['Big Bang Theory'],"" Bialik wrote of the crew member. ""Maybe she was having a bad day. Maybe she hates women who look like they’re going to cry. Now my suitcase is broken from running so hard and aggressively, my asthma is super angry and random people think I’m a prima donna because as she shut the door I said “I have a first class seat!” I didn’t mean I deserve it more, I meant can my suitcase sit in my first class seat and I’ll sit anywhere else? Not a good day for me and @united."" The star revealed on Instagram in earlier posts that she was in Pittsburgh over the weekend, visiting a Jewish community center. She noted in a separate post she had a layover in Denver on the way there. Bialik also posted about the experience on her Instagram story. One post features what appears to be a glass of whiskey and says ""Hey @united Look what you made me do."" The next post is a selfie, which indicated she had been in touch with the airline. She wrote, ""Thank you for being apologetic for the not nice lady @united It means a lot."" United spokesman Jonathan Guerin told USA TODAY in a statement: ""We were able to get Ms. Bialik on the next flight to Los Angeles and we are reviewing what happened with our team in Houston."" USA TODAY has reached out to Bialik's reps for comment.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705945464433868294/How-a-decades-old-HIV-drug-might-help-treat-Alzheimer's,-age-related-diseases	How a decades-old HIV drug might help treat Alzheimer's, age-related diseases	Drugs that inhibit an enzyme called reverse transcriptase have been on the market for decades to treat HIV. Now a team led by Brown University scientists may have found another use for them—to treat age-related disorders, including Alzheimer’s. Lamivudine, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor originally developed by GlaxoSmithKline and approved by the FDA in 1995, cut inflammation and other signs of aging in mice, the researchers reported in a study published in Nature . Chronic inflammation has been fingered as a culprit in many age-related diseases, hence it holds promise to treat such disorders as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and arthritis, John Sedivy, the study’s senior author, said in a statement. When people grow old, some cells stop dividing. These so-called “senescent cells” harbor inflammation-prone risk factors known as senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs).

In the Nature paper, Sedivy and colleagues identified a DNA feature that they believe contributes to age-related inflammation. They're called retrotransposons, or “jumping genes,” and they are DNA sequences that can replicate and move to other sites. Most of them are inactive, and the body maintains certain mechanisms to keep them in check. But Sedivy’s team found that one type of retrotransposon, LINE-1 (L1) can escape those controls in old human cells and old mice. L1 reactivation then triggers a well-characterized antiviral immune response launched by interferon proteins, which can ultimately cause inflammation in neighboring cells, the scientists found. They then focused on finding a way to block viral-like L1 activity to avoid an inflammatory immune response. Because retrotransposons like L1 require the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which HIV also needs to replicate, the researchers figured reverse transcriptase inhibitors currently used against HIV might also work to halt L1. After testing six different HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, the Brown researchers locked onto lamivudine because of its activity and low side effects. In human cells treated with lamivudine, interferon response and SASP factors were decreased. And in mice between 20 and 26 months old, the drug reduced interferon response and inflammation, as well as other age-related signs, including fat and muscle loss and kidney scarring, the team reported. “When we started giving this HIV drug to mice, we noticed they had these amazing anti-inflammatory effects,” Sedivy said in a statement. “Our explanation is that although L1s are activated relatively late in senescence, the interferon response reinforces the SASP response and is responsible for age-associated inflammation.”. RELATED: Denali and Sanofi to press forward with RIPK1 drug in Alzheimer’s and other brain diseases. Inhibiting inflammation to stop tissue damage has become a popular strategy that scientists are exploring as they search for new remedies for age-related disorders such as Alzheimer’s. Denali, under partnership with Sanofi, recently advanced an inhibitor of RIPK1—an enzyme that regulates macrophages—into clinical trials in Alzheimer’s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, for example. Scientists at the University of Florida previously used soluble versions of toll-like receptors to damp down neuro-inflammatory response seen in Alzheimer’s. Sedivy believes his team's findings could open the door to using reverse transcriptase inhibitors for treating multiple age-related disorders including Alzheimer’s. And HIV drugs may also work in other ways beyond blocking L1. A recent Nature study by scientists at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute suggests that gene APP, which encodes for the beta-amyloid protein implicated in Alzheimer's, could reshuffle its DNA to create different forms of toxic proteins other than beta-amyloid. But the gene requires reverse transcriptase to accomplish that. Of course, there’s more work to be done for reverse transcriptase inhibitors to be repurposed in age-related diseases. Sedivy noted that although lamivudine reduced interferon response, “it doesn’t quite go back down to normal.” And the exact structure of the L1 reverse transcriptase needs to be determined to assure minimal side effects, he said.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705647761632658918/How-British-feminism-became-anti-trans---according-to-the-New-York-Times	How British feminism became anti-trans - according to the New York Times	A surprisingly mainstream movement of feminists known as TERFs oppose transgender rights as a symptom of “female erasure.”. Beginning to suspect the writer has a bias... There, the most vocal trans-exclusionary voices are, ostensibly, “feminist” ones, and anti-trans lobbying is a mainstream activity. Case in point: Ms. Parker told the podcast “Feminist Current” that she’d changed her thinking on trans women after spending time on Mumsnet, a site where parents exchange tips on toilet training and how to get their children to eat vegetables. If such a place sounds benign, consider the words of British writer Edie Miller: “Mumsnet is to British transphobia,” she wrote “what 4Chan is to American fascism.”. The term coined to identify women like Ms. Parker and Ms. Long is TERF, which stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist. In Britain, TERFs are a powerful force. If, in the United States, the mainstream media has been alarmingly ready to hear “both sides” on the question of trans people’s right to exist, in Britain, TERFs have effectively succeeded in framing the question of trans rights entirely around their own concerns: that is, how these rights for others could contribute to “female erasure.”. 	0	0	How|British|feminism|became|anti-trans|-|according|to|the|New|York|Times	A|surprisingly|mainstream|movement|of|feminists|known|as|TERFs|oppose|transgender|rights|as|a|symptom|of|“|female|erasure|.|”|.|Beginning|to|suspect|the|writer|has|a|bias|...|There|,|the|most|vocal|trans-exclusionary|voices|are|,|ostensibly|,|“|feminist|”|ones|,|and|anti-trans|lobbying|is|a|mainstream|activity|.|Case|in|point|:|Ms|.|Parker|told|the|podcast|“|Feminist|Current|”|that|she|’|d|changed|her|thinking|on|trans|women|after|spending|time|on|Mumsnet|,|a|site|where|parents|exchange|tips|on|toilet|training|and|how|to|get|their|children|to|eat|vegetables|.|If|such|a|place|sounds|benign|,|consider|the|words|of|British|writer|Edie|Miller|:|“|Mumsnet|is|to|British|transphobia|,|”|she|wrote|“|what|4Chan|is|to|American|fascism|.|”|.|The|term|coined|to|identify|women|like|Ms|.|Parker|and|Ms|.|Long|is|TERF|,|which|stands|for|Trans-Exclusionary|Radical|Feminist|.|In|Britain|,|TERFs|are|a|powerful|force|.|If|,|in|the|United|States|,|the|mainstream|media|has|been|alarmingly|ready|to|hear|“|both|sides|”|on|the|question|of|trans|people|’|s|right|to|exist|,|in|Britain|,|TERFs|have|effectively|succeeded|in|framing|the|question|of|trans|rights|entirely|around|their|own|concerns|:|that|is|,|how|these|rights|for|others|could|contribute|to|“|female|erasure|.|”|.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Thursday February 07 2019 11:00 AM. To mark the International Day of Women and Girls in Science on 11th February, this week our MS and Me blogger Ciara O’Meara highlights the women of science and innovation who have changed the world for us all . The importance of science is too great to ever be underestimated or underappreciated. Without developments and continued progress and innovation in the world of science, we would not have the knowledge and information to understand the behaviour of the world around us. My own thinking on science has evolved dramatically throughout my own life journey. From a naïve and frustrated Leaving Certificate Chemistry student, I am now an avid subscriber to scientific research based journals and a research contributor. My initial train of thought on this topic ran something like this:. Science can no longer be considered a male-dominated area; women and girls have always had a critical role in scientific research and development. And continue to do so. The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development focuses on the importance of science, empowerment and gender equality to achieve their identified goals. Given that less than 30% of researchers worldwide are women and in tandem with the UN’s goals for sustainable development, The United Nations General Assembly declared February 11th as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. Women are more at risk of developing Multiple Sclerosis in comparison to our male counterparts. Given this female dominance, it seems only right to give credit to some of the women and girls who have contributed to recent scientific research and development in the field of MS. Maria Howard, MD at Harvard Medical School (2018), focused her research on pregnancy and MS. Given the diagnosis of MS in women of childbearing age, her research examined annual pregnancy rates between women with and without MS and also studied medical insurance claims made in terms of complications which occurred post pregnancy. Her results were promising with an increase in women with MS becoming pregnant in comparison to a decrease in pregnancies among women without MS between 2006-2014. Medical claims relating to difficulties encountered post partum, i.e. birth complications, premature labours, were similar in statistics between women with and without MS. Her research, in tandem with other studies, strengthens the understanding among women that pregnancy does not necessarily affect the long term clinical course of MS and can be done so successfully with the support and monitoring of health care professionals, new treatments and continued research. The importance of early screening and recognition of cognitive impairments in people living with MS has been highlighted through the work of Dr Rosalind Kalb (2018). Her research has focused on the importance of establishing standard baseline assessments for cognition, appropriate treatments, increased awareness and education among healthcare professionals and stricter monitoring. This initial research by Dr Kalb on the importance of cognitive health and monitoring among people with MS has paved the way for future researchers to develop on this identified need and work on tools to address these issues. Scientific Research in the field of MS is developing daily and women and girls are playing a more prominent role in their contribution to the field. There is an increase in female led research in the areas of drug therapy, complementary therapies for MS and an increase in the number of grants, funding and research scholarships awarded to females. February 11th is one day to mark the role that women and girls play in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Let’s encourage, empower and support girls and women every other day of the year. Check out these resources for further reading on scientists mentioned in the piece:.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705126592331033355/Trump-highlights-health-agenda-with-vow-to-lower-unfair-drug-prices	Trump highlights health agenda with vow to lower ‘unfair’ drug prices	"Reviewed by James Ives, MPsych Feb 6 2019. It was not the centerpiece, but health was a persistent theme in President Donald Trump's State of the Union address at the Capitol on Tuesday night. Although the administration has focused more on issues of trade, taxes and immigration, the president laid out a series of health-related goals, including some that even Democrats indicated could be areas of bipartisan negotiation or compromise. Trump vowed to take on prescription drug prices, pursue an end to the HIV epidemic and boost funding for childhood cancers. He also took a victory lap for goals promoted by his administration that had been accomplished. ""We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty,"" he said, referring to the requirement in the Affordable Care Act that most people must have health insurance or pay a fine. It was eliminated as part of the 2017 GOP tax bill, despite backlash from critics that it could undercut Obamacare, after many failed attempts by Republicans to repeal the law. And Trump noted congressional passage of a ""right to try"" bill that was supposed to make it easier for terminally ill patients to gain access to experimental medications, but so far few patients have been able to make the law work for them. The most likely ground for bipartisanship will be the issue of drug prices, where Democrats are as eager as the president to do something to rein in prices that are spiraling upward. ""It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, this is unfair, and together we will stop it. We will stop it fast,"" he said. ""I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients."" Democrats are cautiously optimistic on the drug price front. ""I really am hopeful about making strides on prescription drug legislation this year on a bipartisan basis,"" Wendell Primus, top health aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said at a conference for health policy researchers hours before the speech. But not all of Trump's claims Tuesday about his efforts on drug pricing stand up to close scrutiny. He proclaimed that ""in 2018 drug prices experienced their single-largest decline in 46 years.” The drug-price portion of the consumer price index (CPI) declined slightly last year for the first time since 1972, but prices for many individual drugs are still rising sharply. Factors beyond the administration's actions appear to have played the biggest role in the overall slowdown. Drug price increases have slowed largely because patents have expired on expensive, blockbuster drugs and several years have passed since the introduction of expensive medicines to treat hepatitis C, according to independent analysts. But even as consumer drug prices have moderated, drug spending per hospital admission soared 19 percent from 2015 to 2017, a study sponsored by hospital trade groups found last month. That includes anesthesia drugs, chemotherapy infusions and other medicines that are not counted in the CPI. Some well-placed Republicans praised the drug price effort. ""I expect deep-pocketed interests to oppose anything and everything to protect the status quo,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee. ""But the moment is ripe for action and Americans expect us to work together to get the job done."" News organizations including Kaiser Health News have reported on dozens of cases of surprise hospital bills, unaffordable costs for life-sustaining drugs and other health-expense shocks for patients. Shereese Hickson, whose experience with a $123,000 bill for multiple sclerosis drugs was covered by KHN and National Public Radio , was watching the speech. “I’m glad he mentioned it,” she said of Trump’s promise to bring transparency and competition to pharmaceutical prices. “But I would like to see if it really will come true. If you do that — that’s going against the drug companies. They’ll be losing money and they’re not going to let that happen.”. Paul Davis — a retired doctor from Findlay, Ohio, whose family's experience with a $17,850 bill for a simple urine test was detailed in a KHN-NPR ""Bill of the Month"" feature last year and who met with Trump about surprise billing last month — said he was disappointed Trump did not go into further detail about his health care proposals. ""He didn't say anything,"" he said. Davis said he would have liked to have heard more about the administration's recently announced plan to eliminate drug rebates negotiated by middlemen in the Medicare drug program, as well as the recently implemented policy requiring hospitals to list their prices online. ""If he wanted to use the podium to talk about the wonderful things that he's done, that's one of the things he's gotten accomplished,"" Davis said. In their official responses to the speech, Democrats were more combative. ""In this great nation, Americans are skipping blood pressure pills, forced to choose between buying medicine or paying rent,"" said Stacey Abrams, former Georgia House minority leader and a rising star in the national Democratic Party. ""Maternal mortality rates show that mothers, especially black mothers, risk death to give birth. And in 14 states, including my home state where a majority want it, our leaders refuse to expand Medicaid, which could save rural hospitals, economies and lives."" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who gave the Spanish-language Democratic response, reminded viewers that while the Trump administration is seeking to have the Affordable Care Act overturned in court, Democrats would provide ""medical care for your family that no politician can take away from you."" In another outreach to Democrats, Trump vowed that his budget ""will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America,"" he said. Groups that have been fighting HIV praised the promise. ""While we might have policy differences with the president and his administration, this initiative, if properly implemented and resourced, can go down in history as one of the most significant achievements of his presidency,"" said Michael Ruppal, executive director of The AIDS Institute. Trump also promised that his budget, which has been delayed by the recent government shutdown, will seek new funding to expand research into cures and treatments for childhood cancer. He said he will seek ""$500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical lifesaving research."" The National Institutes of Health has long been a bipartisan favorite in Congress, although Trump in his first budget did seek cuts in NIH funding . The one area in which bipartisanship will clearly not prevail is that of abortion. Trump reiterated a promise he made to anti-abortion groups as a candidate in 2016 and pushed for a federal bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. ""Let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God,"" he said. Senate Republicans voted on such a bill in 2018 ; it failed to advance by a large margin. The bill still lacks the votes in the Senate, and the House now has a majority that supports abortion rights . Abortion opponents praised the president's comments. ""Once again, President Trump has proved he is our nation's most pro-life president ever and he is keeping his promise to the voters who fueled his victory,"" said Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List. Abortion-rights supporters, meanwhile, chastised Trump's comments. ""Shame on the president for using the State of the Union to vilify people who have abortions and the providers who care for them,"" said Megan Donovan of the Guttmacher Institute. ""Make no mistake: This is part of a larger agenda to eliminate access to abortion altogether."" Staff writers Jay Hancock, Emmarie Huetteman and Ana B. Ibarra contributed to this report.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705645137574265640/Trump-should-have-channeled-Reagan-in-his-State-of-the-Union-address	Trump should have channeled Reagan in his State of the Union address	"Trump should have channeled Reagan, not Nixon, in his State of the Union address. Aaron Kall and Joshua Clark Opinion contributors. Published 3:33 PM EST Feb 6, 2019. The stars were aligned for President Donald Trump to emulate Ronald Reagan in the House chamber Tuesday night. Trump has gleefully compared himself to Reagan on several occasions, and there are numerous commonalities between the two. They both have entertainment backgrounds and former associations with the Democratic Party. They both suffered stinging midterm rebukes and sagging poll numbers two years after winning long-shot elections against establishment candidates. They also share the distinction of giving State of the Union addresses that were delayed by a week. Reagan’s 1986 speech was postponed by the tragic Space Shuttle Challenger crash. Trump's was delayed by the recent 35-day shutdown that ensnared a quarter of the federal government. Given this connective tissue and the high stakes surrounding his speech, Trump would have much better served by following Reagan’s successful framework for the State of the Union, specifically his 1982 address and singularly focused homage to guest hero Lenny Skutnik. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence clap for President Donald Trump, Washington, DC, Feb. 5, 2019. Jarrad Henderson, Jarrad Henderson-USA TODAY. Read more commentary:. State of Trump's Union: We're coping with our ethically heedless Brigadoon president. Trump's State of the Union address lays groundwork for 2020 re-election campaign. Donald Trump pretends to be presidential during State of the Union to con the nation. Historians consider Reagan’s 1982 and 1986 State of the Union addresses two of the best ever. One reason for Reagan’s success was his brevity. These two speeches lasted 30 to 40 minutes, and Reagan's average length for all of them was 40 minutes. Trump doubled this appropriate duration of time with an 80-minute opus in 2018 that he narrowly exceeded this week. Comedian Stephen Colbert equated the speech to watching paint dry. Viewers these days have an enormous number of competing media options, and those watching the speech likely tuned out in the middle. In his 1982 speech, Reagan ingeniously decided to invite the first presidential guest to attend the State of the Union address and sit prominently next to the first lady. Two weeks earlier, Skutnik, a Congressional Budget Office employee, had jumped into the icy waters of the Potomac River to rescue a survivor of the Air Florida Flight 90 plane crash. Reagan saluted Skutnik at the very end of his address and said Skutnik’s bravery demonstrated “the spirit of American heroism at its finest.” The House chamber erupted in applause and presidents ever since have invited special guests, both to elicit an emotional response and to help advance their political agendas. Guests to advance an anti-immigration agenda. Trump is obviously aware of this presidential stagecraft that Reagan perfected, but his attempt to replicate it has now failed twice. There was just one Lenny Skutnik, but a whopping 15 names appeared on Trump's 2018 State of the Union special guest list. On Tuesday, he had 18 guests. Such a deep roster of invitees devalues their unique stories and means less time in the limelight. Trump’s overuse of the device feels as if he is pitching a new reality show. In addition to having too many guests, Trump has frequently used them to articulate his strict anti-immigration agenda. Four guests from the 2018 State of the Union address were parents of two teenage girls who were tragically killed by MS-13 gang members in Long Island. Several guests from Trump’s 2017 address to a joint session of Congress were similarly connected to immigrant crimes. Trump used the word ""countless"" to describe the number of Americans murdered by illegal immigrants (though studies show that both legal and undocumented immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans) and he warned of new caravan threats ""on the march"" as Democrats booed. Trump also told the painful story of grandparents from Reno, Nevada, who were murdered this year, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant, and introduced several family members of the victims. His antagonistic immigration posture during major speeches has yet to produce any tangible results, and his latest performance doesn't put Congress any closer to reaching a spending deal to forestall another government shutdown. Down the partisan rabbit hole with Trump. Instead of going down the partisan rabbit hole again, Trump should have modeled Reagan by inviting just one everyday American hero — for instance, James Shaw Jr. The 29-year-old is credited with saving numerous lives after disarming Travis Reinking and his AR-15 at the Waffle House last year in Antioch, Tennessee. Shaw then created a fundraiser for the victims of the attack. Trump did eventually talk with Shaw Jr. on the telephone, but a well-deserved trip to the White House never materialized. Trump may have avoided inviting the selfless American hero because of the style of the rifle involved in the Waffle House shooting and many others. Not only did the country not get a Reagan-like speech from Trump, it reverberated with echoes of Richard Nixon. Trump said partisan investigations are one of the only things that can stop the ""economic miracle"" taking place in the United States. He also said passing legislation is incompatible with investigation. In his disciplined 2018 address, Trump didn't come close to talking about Russia. This time he channeled Nixon, who infamously called for an end to the Watergate investigation in his 1974 address. Later the same year, Nixon resigned from the presidency. During this difficult time, America needs an ordinary hero as well as hope and optimism in the future of the country. Unfortunately, Trump failed to deliver on both accounts.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705347031101958434/In-their-DNA:-Rotator-cuff-stem-cells-more-likely-to-develop-into-fat-cells	In their DNA: Rotator cuff stem cells more likely to develop into fat cells	"February 6, 2019 - Why are fat deposits more likely to occur after tears of the shoulder's rotator cuff , compared to other types of muscle injuries? An increased propensity of stem cells within with rotator cuff muscles to develop into fat cells may explain the difference, reports a study in the February 6, 2019 issue of The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery . The journal is published in the Lippincott portfolio in partnership with Wolters Kluwer . ""Satellite"" stem cells in the rotator cuff are more likely to develop into fat cells and less likely to develop into muscle cells, compared to calf muscle satellite cells, according to the experimental study by Christopher L. Mendias, PhD, ATC, and colleagues of the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, and the Hospital for Special Surgery, New York. The researchers write, ""There appears to be a cellular and genetic basis behind the generally poor rates of rotator cuff muscle healing."" 'Satellite Cells' May Form More Fat Than Muscle after Rotator Cuff Tears. The researchers performed a series of experiments using muscle cells from mice to evaluate the characteristics of a type of stem cells called satellite cells. Stem cells are specialized cells with the potential to develop into different types of cells. Satellite cells, located between muscle fibers, play an essential role in repair after muscle injuries. Tears of the shoulder rotator cuff are a common problem. Especially in chronic tears, deposits of fat often develop, contributing to weakening and atrophy of the rotator cuff muscles. This fatty infiltration can continue even after successful rotator cuff repair surgery. Dr. Mendias and colleagues created cultures of satellite cells isolated from mouse rotator cuff and calf muscles. ""Clinically, we know that the rotator cuff is one of the most difficult muscle groups to rehabilitate after injury, and this is thought to occur due to the extensive fat that accumulates in the muscle in patients with chronic tears,"" says lead author Manuel Schubert, MD, MS, chief resident in orthopaedic surgery at the University of Michigan. ""We thought there might be a genetic basis to explain why the rotator cuff accumulates fat after injury, and the specialized transgenic model we used in this study allowed us to precisely test this."" Compared to the calf muscle satellite cells, satellite cells from the rotator cuff developed into 23 percent fewer muscle cells, and they showed an 87 percent decrease in a ""marker"" for muscle formation. The rotator cuff satellite cells also had a four- to 65-fold increase in markers of genes involved in fat cell generation (adipogenesis). DNA-level (epigenetic) studies identified hundreds of differences in gene activation between satellite cells from rotator cuff versus calf muscles. The affected genes were involved in pathways related to fat metabolism and adipogenesis, suggesting the muscle stem cells from the rotator cuff are programmed to more easily become fat cells. Building on previous research, the new study shows increased ""adipogenic differentiation capacity"" of rotator cuff satellite cells. Increased potential to develop into fat cells - and decreased potential to develop into muscle cells - may be an important explanation for the high rate of fatty infiltration in muscles of patients with chronic rotator cuff tears, even after rotator cuff surgery. The study also has potential therapeutic findings. ""Satellite cells can be isolated from other muscle groups with relative ease."" says Dr. Mendias, an Associate Scientist at the Hospital for Special Surgery and an Adjunct Associate Professor at the University of Michigan. ""While further studies are necessary, it is possible that a patient's own stem cells from a muscle that heals well, like the calf, could be transplanted to the rotator cuff muscle at the time of surgical repair. These transplanted cells might be better able to regenerate the chronically damaged muscle than the resident stem cells.""

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4719884367068315109/MS-Ireland--::-Helping-Everyone-Affected-by-Multiple-Sclerosis	MS Ireland  :: Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis	MS Ireland  ::. Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Monday June 26 2017 10:45 AM. Cladribine Tablets receives positive CHMP opinion for treatment of relapsing forms of MS. Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued a positive opinion for approval of Cladribine Tablets (proposed tradename MAVENCLADTM) for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in patients with high disease activity. “The positive opinion from the CHMP is an extraordinary development for Merck, affirming our belief in Cladribine Tablets as a potential important treatment option for patients living with multiple sclerosis,” said Belén Garijo, member of the Executive Board of Merck and CEO Healthcare. “We now eagerly await the European Commission decision, and the opportunity to make a difference in the MS treatment paradigm. Our sincerest thanks to the entire MS community for their unwavering support throughout the Cladribine Tablets journey.”. “We strongly believe in the therapeutic value of Cladribine Tablets and the significant impact this investigational therapy may have on the future of MS care,” said Luciano Rossetti, Global Head of R&D for the biopharma business of Merck. “There are still significant unmet needs for patients with MS, particularly those with high disease activity. We look forward to our continued partnership with the EMA, which has been an invaluable scientific advisor in helping us advance the development of Cladribine Tablets.”. The CHMP positive opinion is based on more than 10,000 patient years of data with over 2,700 patients included in the clinical trial program, and more than 10 years of observation in some patients. The clinical development program included data from three Phase III trials, CLARITY, CLARITY EXTENSION and ORACLE MS, the Phase II ONWARD study and long-term follow-up data from the 8-year prospective registry, PREMIERE. The efficacy and safety results of these studies allowed a full characterization of the benefit-to-risk profile of Cladribine Tablets. In patients with high disease activity, post hoc analyses of the two-year Phase III CLARITY trial demonstrated that Cladribine Tablets reduced the annualised relapse rate by 67% and the risk of 6-month confirmed EDSS progression by 82% versus placebo. As demonstrated in the Phase III CLARITY EXTENSION study no further Cladribine treatment was required in Years 3 and 4. The comprehensive dataset has informed the posology and monitoring requirements. The most important side effects are lymphopenia, which can be severe and long-lasting, and infections, including herpes zoster. The CHMP’s recommendation will be referred to the European Commission which is expected to make a final decision on the marketing authorisation application for Cladribine Tablets within 67 days from the CHMP opinion. MAVENCLAD™ is the proprietary name submitted to EMA for the investigational medicine Cladribine Tablets. MS Ireland welcomes the news that cladribine has been approved by the CHMP. Ava Battles, Chief Executive, says, “The development of new medications such as cladribine is of crucial importance in the fight against relapsing remitting MS, and offers hope to those living with the condition.

Credit: Larraufie et al./ Cell Reports. How bariatric surgery helps people with obesity and diabetes is related to changes in the way the gut senses food and nutrients after the operation, researchers report February 5 in the journal Cell Reports . They found that following surgery, altered patterns of digestion and absorption lower in the gut trigger production of higher levels of gut hormones, especially glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which in turn causes higher insulin production. ""For people who have gastric bypass surgery to treat obesity and who also have diabetes, after surgery body weight is reduced and the diabetes melts away quickly,"" says senior author Fiona Gribble of the Cambridge University Metabolic Research Laboratories at the Wellcome Trust - MRC Institute of Metabolic Science. ""But in lean patients with gastric cancer, they start off having normal glucose control and after the operation they end up having frequent hypoglycemic episodes because their sugar levels dip."" The team wanted to learn more about the mechanism explaining these opposite results regarding glucose management. Researchers have long known that bariatric surgery changes how the food you eat is digested and absorbed down the gut. They also knew that hormone-producing cells in the gut, such as GLP-1 and peptide-YY (PYY) are elevated afterwards. But they did not know the precise connection between these facts. For this study, the team decided to focus on GLP-1 as it is a major hormone involved in diabetes treatment. At least a half dozen GLP-1-based medications are available for managing Type 2 diabetes. ""Our theory was that the high GLP-1 levels produced after surgery are quite important for improving your blood glucose after surgery,"" says Gribble. The team studied five individuals receiving bariatric surgery for a hereditary form of gastric cancer. Participants received Exendin-9, a compound that blocks the action of GLP-1, at the same time as taking glucose by mouth. They found that concentrations of insulin, the hormone responsible for lowering blood glucose levels, did not increase as dramatically when these individuals were given Exendin-9 and did not suffer hypoglycemic episodes. ""We found that blocking the GLP-1 hormone with the Exendin-9 blocked its effect on the pancreatic beta cells that produce the insulin,"" says Gribble. The team also wanted to know why GLP-1 levels rise so high after surgery. Normally, food is digested and absorbed high up in the gut. But after surgery, it happens lower down because of the gut rearrangement that involves a Y-shape connection between the bile and pancreatic enzymes with the food. ""Most digestion does not happen until the bile and the pancreatic enzymes coming down from one side join the food coming down the other side, which occurs lower in the gut,"" explains Gribble. That is important because most GLP-1 is released lower down the gut. ""If you digest and absorb your nutrients a bit lower down, you consequently stimulate the release of much more GLP-1."" Using new RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based measurements they developed for this research, the team mapped the location of various hormonal peptides in the gut in humans and mice before and after surgery. They found that the cells producing the GLP-1 hormone and other gut hormones are not affected by the surgery. ""This means that the reason for higher GLP-1 secretion is not because the surgery changes the hormone production by the gut, but it is because nutrient digestion and absorption happens in a different place in the gut and that causes higher levels of GLP-1 and PYY,"" says Gribble. Looking forward, the team hopes to learn the precise mechanism responsible for the rapid weight loss in bariatric surgery. ""If you can work that out and make a therapy that mimics that, that is what everyone wants: an injectable or oral medication that could mimic the surgery and cause weight loss in people without the surgery,"" she says. And for those suffering from hypoglycemia after gastric cancer surgery, development of a compound that blocks GLP-1 on a more permanent basis may help improve quality of life for patients who currently make significant adaptations to their eating behavior to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. This work was partially funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), Wellcome Trust, and the EFSD/Novo Nordisk Programme for Diabetes Research in Europe. The LC-MS/MS analysis was established using a research grant from Medimmune/AstraZeneca.

"IMAGE: Schematic drawings demonstrating the local effects of the modern golf swing on the lumbar spine (example shown at the L4-5 level), contributing to repetitive traumatic discopathy. Upper: During the backswing,... Credit: © 2018 Barrow Neurological Institute. CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA (FEBRUARY 5, 2019). In the article ""Golf: a contact sport. Repetitive traumatic discopathy may be the driver of early lumbar degeneration in modern-era golfers"" published today in the Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine , Drs. Corey T. Walker, Juan S. Uribe, and Randall W. Porter from Barrow Neurological Institute describe the biomechanics of modern-era golf and its clinical consequences. The authors point out that ""among professional and amateur golfers, back disorders remain the most common injury, comprising 55% and 35% of injuries in these groups, respectively."" They also note that modern professional golfers are experiencing back problems at far younger ages than the general population. To explain this, they focus on how the golf swing of present-day professionals, such as Tiger Woods, differs from that employed by golf legends Jack Nicklaus and Ben Hogan. As golf has evolved over the last two decades, the golf swing has become more powerful. To keep up, modern-era professional golf players participate in intensive strength-training sessions. And the techniques of the swing have also changed. During the downswing, greater compressive force is directed toward the spinal disc and facet joints, and this affects these structures asymmetrically. With more than 300 swings per golf-playing day, the golfer repeatedly experiences minor traumatic injuries to the spine, which over time can result in a pathogenic process that the authors have termed ""repetitive traumatic discopathy"" (RTD). To illustrate how this can occur, the authors discuss Woods' years of debilitating spine pain. In this paper Walker and colleagues discuss modern-day golf swing biomechanics and how they relate to the development of RTD, earlier ages of players exhibiting RTD, and the possibility that golfer's athletic strength training may contribute to RTD. They also address treatment of patients with this repetitive spinal injury. When asked about the study, Dr. Walker said, ""We believe Tiger Wood's experience with spinal disease highlights a real and under-recognized issue amongst modern era golfers. Repetitive traumatic discopathy (RTD) results from years of degenerative 'hits' or strains on the spine resulting in early onset breakdown, instability, and pain. We hope medical practitioners, and surgeons in particular, will be able to diagnose and treat golfers with RTD in a specialized fashion going forward.""

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a technique used in analytical chemistry that combines the two analytical techniques of high-capacity separation with liquid chromatography (LC) and the high-sensitivity detection of mass spectrometry (MS). Samples in gas chromatography analysis in the laboratory. Image Credit: Hotsum / Shutterstock. LC separates the components of a mixture based on their affinity to a stationary or mobile phase and subsequently detects these components using ultraviolet light, fluorescence, or electrical conductivity, which can all affect the analysed substances. The basis of MS is the separation of ionised components in a vacuum according to their mass-to-charge ratio. Component concentrations are quantitatively analysed according to the intensity of the measured peaks. The ability to quantify concentrations of ions of mass is limited to solutions of single components, as multiple component analysis yields spectra that are complex and difficult to analyse. Consequently, LC-MS combines the separation resolution of LC with the qualitative capabilities of MS. MS techniques enable the molecular mass and structural characteristics of eluted components to be determined. This process complements the qualitative data obtained from the retention times recorded by LC. The quality of data derived from MS can be enhanced by imposing a parameter called selected ion monitoring (SIM), which is highly sensitive and allows quantitative analysis that circumvents effects of impurities that fail to be removed by LC. Mass spectrometry has been the detection technique of choice for pharmaceutical analysis for many years. It is a powerful means of analysis that allows complex pharmacological mixtures to be separated into their constituent components. In addition, LC-MS is a sensitive, well-understood and highly reproducible technique. LC-MS is used to analyse pharmaceuticals across a variety of stages in their discovery and development. These stages include drug discovery, metabolism studies ( in vitro and in vivo ), and identification of impurities and degradation products. The process of drug discovery usually begins with the isolation and characterisation of potential drug substances that originate from synthetic or natural compounds. LC-MS in drug metabolism studies. Before a compound can be developed into a drug, it must be studied extensively to determine its potential therapeutic value. An attractive candidate should be metabolically stable and possess a good pharmacokinetic profile. Pharmacokinetics describes how the body affects drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Furthermore, the drug should demonstrate good bioavailability, which is defined as the quantity of administered drug that reaches the circulation and persists there for a satisfactory period during which it can produce the desired action. This latter characteristic is called a half-life. An active metabolite is formed from the compound after the candidate is metabolised by the body. The metabolite(s) may be more pharmacokinetically active than the ‘parent’ candidate drug (from which the candidate is derived). Therefore, correct characterisation of the major and minor metabolites aids in the identification of drugs with improved metabolic stability, pharmacological activity and stability. This analysis also ensures that the toxicology profile of the drug is improved, ensuring drug safety. In Vitro drug metabolism. This branch of study is concerned with analysing the effects of a drug on organs outside the body. The liver is the organ primarily responsible for drug metabolism. For this reason, liver microsomal preparations or hepatocytes are used as the tissue for in vitro testing and provide an indication of the metabolic outcomes of a drug. 3-hydroxytamoxifen is a drug derived from tamoxifen, an anti-breast cancer agent, that is used to demonstrate the application of LC-MS in drug metabolism. 3- hydroxytamoxifen tested on human liver microsomes is an example of in vitro metabolism study. In 2002, Chang-Kee and Gwyn identified the metabolites desmethyldroloxifene, 4-hydroxydroloxifene, droloxifene N-oxide, and a-hydroxydroloxifene. The latter three metabolites had identical mass-to-charge ratios of 404. Chromatographic resolution (the LC of LC-MS) was paramount in this case to differentiate between compounds. In Vivo Drug Metabolism. In vivo metabolism studies involve monitoring drug discovery in the body with a focus on drugs and metabolites in blood, urine, and faeces. Samples taken from these sources contain endogenous compounds that have the potential to compromise the resolution obtained by LC-MS. It is, therefore, necessary to implement a good sample preparation technique and chromatographic separation is required to successfully apply LC-MS. This is exemplified by the in vivo analysis of 3-hydroxytamoxifen and its metabolites from the plasma of breast milk taken from a breast cancer patient. In another experiment by Chang-Kee and Gwyn (2002), three peaks were discovered at m/z 388. These were characterised as 4-hydroxytamoxifen, 4’-hydroxytamoxifen, and tamoxifen N-oxide based on MS. Further MS study called tandem MS/MS was used to identify peaks caused by an endogenous plasma component unrelated to tamoxifen and the metabolite N-desdimethyltamoxifen. This experiment demonstrates the limitation of using LC-MS alone without MS/MS. Identification of impurities and degradation products. The identification of impurities and degradation products is important to ensure that observed pharmacological and toxicological effects are due to the drug rather than impurities. Analysis of the impurities and products of degradation is essential in preventing the production of harmful compounds during the drug’s shelf-life. Knowledge of degradation products augments the understanding of side-effects that may arise and enables synthesis of new, more stable drugs. Impurities in drugs are predominantly formed during the synthesis of drugs from raw materials. Similarly, by-products may arise during the synthetic process. The mixture yielded by the synthetic process, therefore, contains varied concentrations of compounds; thus, sensitive and specific detection is necessary to ensure their removal. It is for this reason that LC-MS is widely implemented in this process.

Having had multiple sclerosis (MS) for over 18 years, I feel like I’ve experienced every documented and undocumented MS symptom. I’ve struggled with this disease through nearly every major life event so far – elementary school, high school, university and I have even had to change my career plans. MS has had a huge impact on my life. From age 12 to my early 20s, it was very hard to find solace in the MS Society of Canada and my local MS clinic because I was quite young compared to everyone around me. I also grew up in a rural setting, which didn’t have many support options. My medications made me quite ill, but I felt I had to endure the pain and side effects because if I didn’t, I’d get worse. Despite my best efforts, I still lost my vision numerous times, had vertigo, no balance, partial paralysis, the list goes on. To put it plainly, I got worse. People – even fellow MS’ers – may look at me now and think I am fine and that I don’t understand what they’re going through. But trust me, I really do. I’ve had optic neuritis numerous times and so many flare-ups, I’ve lost count. I have also had to change my medication at least three times. I had lost hope in the clinic and the Society until one day I just started taking better care of myself and treating my body better – inside and out. But what I didn’t realize was that while I was changing, so was the MS Society. They started to listen to patients more, which reflected in their programs, services, and even the research they supported. They started looking not just at the biomedical research, which is important, but also investing more in research around more holistic approaches, with things like the Wellness Research Innovation Grant. How is it possible that with a progressive disease like MS, I feel better and stronger 18 years after my diagnosis? There are many things that influence how a person feels. I am on medication now that has fewer side effects, but I am also eating better, staying active, meditating and playing with my animals. This left me wondering: what really influences the progression of MS? Despite the prevalence of MS in Canada, we have yet to understand the mechanisms behind progression. The Canadian Proactive Cohort for People Living with MS (CanProCo) is aimed at doing just that. But what makes this study truly unique is its collaborative efforts, not just with other researchers, but also with people living with MS. It is my hope that this study will allow for a better understanding and more accurate depiction of what life with MS is really all about. People with MS are often placed into two categories – either they have progressive or relapsing-remitting MS. For a lot of people living with MS, a snapshot is taken at the moment of data collection (usually at your yearly appointment) and that is all until your next check-up in a year. That’s one of the things that makes the CanProCo unique. This research project has the potential to be a game changer because a lot of information is being collected over a duration of time. What’s even more fascinating, is that not all the information is purely biomedical. The study looks to examine you from both the inside and the outside so factors like environment, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and others will be considered as well. Not only has the study itself been carefully crafted to examining all of these aspects, but the researchers are willing and open to inviting the many perspectives of people who are affected by MS. Instead of a one-time appointment, participants will be followed for at least five years and the patient’s voice will be heard in a genuine and safe manner. The CanProCo has the potential to reach many Canadians living with MS – some of whom may not feel they’ve had a chance to share their story or that their MS community doesn’t understand them. This study has the opportunity to be very powerful and make an impact in influencing further change in people’s lives. Everyone has an MS story that is uniquely their own. Now researchers want to be part of yours too. 	1	1	Breaking|Down|the|Canadian|Proactive|Cohort|for|People|Living|with|MS|-|CanProCo|-|-|Blog|-|MS|Society|of|Canada	Part|I|:|Heidi|’|s|journey|with|MS|.|Having|had|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|for|over|18|years|,|I|feel|like|I|’|ve|experienced|every|documented|and|undocumented|MS|symptom|.|I|’|ve|struggled|with|this|disease|through|nearly|every|major|life|event|so|far|–|elementary|school|,|high|school|,|university|and|I|have|even|had|to|change|my|career|plans|.|MS|has|had|a|huge|impact|on|my|life|.|From|age|12|to|my|early|20s|,|it|was|very|hard|to|find|solace|in|the|MS|Society|of|Canada|and|my|local|MS|clinic|because|I|was|quite|young|compared|to|everyone|around|me|.|I|also|grew|up|in|a|rural|setting|,|which|didn|’|t|have|many|support|options|.|My|medications|made|me|quite|ill|,|but|I|felt|I|had|to|endure|the|pain|and|side|effects|because|if|I|didn|’|t|,|I|’|d|get|worse|.|Despite|my|best|efforts|,|I|still|lost|my|vision|numerous|times|,|had|vertigo|,|no|balance|,|partial|paralysis|,|the|list|goes|on|.|To|put|it|plainly|,|I|got|worse|.|People|–|even|fellow|MS|’|ers|–|may|look|at|me|now|and|think|I|am|fine|and|that|I|don|’|t|understand|what|they|’|re|going|through|.|But|trust|me|,|I|really|do|.|I|’|ve|had|optic|neuritis|numerous|times|and|so|many|flare-ups|,|I|’|ve|lost|count|.|I|have|also|had|to|change|my|medication|at|least|three|times|.|I|had|lost|hope|in|the|clinic|and|the|Society|until|one|day|I|just|started|taking|better|care|of|myself|and|treating|my|body|better|–|inside|and|out|.|But|what|I|didn|’|t|realize|was|that|while|I|was|changing|,|so|was|the|MS|Society|.|They|started|to|listen|to|patients|more|,|which|reflected|in|their|programs|,|services|,|and|even|the|research|they|supported|.|They|started|looking|not|just|at|the|biomedical|research|,|which|is|important|,|but|also|investing|more|in|research|around|more|holistic|approaches|,|with|things|like|the|Wellness|Research|Innovation|Grant|.|How|is|it|possible|that|with|a|progressive|disease|like|MS|,|I|feel|better|and|stronger|18|years|after|my|diagnosis|?|There|are|many|things|that|influence|how|a|person|feels|.|I|am|on|medication|now|that|has|fewer|side|effects|,|but|I|am|also|eating|better|,|staying|active|,|meditating|and|playing|with|my|animals|.|This|left|me|wondering|:|what|really|influences|the|progression|of|MS|?|Despite|the|prevalence|of|MS|in|Canada|,|we|have|yet|to|understand|the|mechanisms|behind|progression|.|The|Canadian|Proactive|Cohort|for|People|Living|with|MS|(|CanProCo|)|is|aimed|at|doing|just|that|.|But|what|makes|this|study|truly|unique|is|its|collaborative|efforts|,|not|just|with|other|researchers|,|but|also|with|people|living|with|MS|.|It|is|my|hope|that|this|study|will|allow|for|a|better|understanding|and|more|accurate|depiction|of|what|life|with|MS|is|really|all|about|.|People|with|MS|are|often|placed|into|two|categories|–|either|they|have|progressive|or|relapsing-remitting|MS|.|For|a|lot|of|people|living|with|MS|,|a|snapshot|is|taken|at|the|moment|of|data|collection|(|usually|at|your|yearly|appointment|)|and|that|is|all|until|your|next|check-up|in|a|year|.|That|’|s|one|of|the|things|that|makes|the|CanProCo|unique|.|This|research|project|has|the|potential|to|be|a|game|changer|because|a|lot|of|information|is|being|collected|over|a|duration|of|time|.|What|’|s|even|more|fascinating|,|is|that|not|all|the|information|is|purely|biomedical|.|The|study|looks|to|examine|you|from|both|the|inside|and|the|outside|so|factors|like|environment|,|lifestyle|,|socioeconomic|status|,|and|others|will|be|considered|as|well|.|Not|only|has|the|study|itself|been|carefully|crafted|to|examining|all|of|these|aspects|,|but|the|researchers|are|willing|and|open|to|inviting|the|many|perspectives|of|people|who|are|affected|by|MS|.|Instead|of|a|one-time|appointment|,|participants|will|be|followed|for|at|least|five|years|and|the|patient|’|s|voice|will|be|heard|in|a|genuine|and|safe|manner|.|The|CanProCo|has|the|potential|to|reach|many|Canadians|living|with|MS|–|some|of|whom|may|not|feel|they|’|ve|had|a|chance|to|share|their|story|or|that|their|MS|community|doesn|’|t|understand|them|.|This|study|has|the|opportunity|to|be|very|powerful|and|make|an|impact|in|influencing|further|change|in|people|’|s|lives|.|Everyone|has|an|MS|story|that|is|uniquely|their|own|.|Now|researchers|want|to|be|part|of|yours|too|.

Please help- needing to know what to ask dr for*. im new to this forumi REALLY NEED HELP . But not new to being sick. I had colorectal cancer fought for 5 years and my fair share of health issues. However recently all my issues are pointing towards MS-. Major spasms in rib cage like a Charlie horse even waking up at night with them. Feet legs ankles hands arms fingers ache and feel swollen and stuck super stiff they also get pins and needles and feel very hot. Sleepiness for 5 days straight. Tripping and stairs are terribly hard. Every joint hurts. my questions are this-. 1- I recently had an mri without contrast of my lower back. Nothing was mentioned of lesions. Would they only be able to see them with contrast? 2- I had a brain mri scan one year ago with contrast and nothing was mentioned with lesions. Could lesions grown in a year? 3- I just had a full body PET/CT scan with contrast to check and see if my cancer has spread. This also mentioned nothing about lesions. would these tests have shown ms? Or no? I Feel like a total freak asking for more testing but I’m not sure if the proper testing was done for MS. Can someone please help me understand? Feb 06, 2019 8:21 PM. ASK ASK ASK, ASK AGAIN.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4704994678659467090/M.I.A.-but-now-here's-an-update	M.I.A. but now here's an update	"For those who have been conversing with me over the years (a few that come to mind: mamabug, marti, koko, julesa, seasha, and more ... I might have spelled some of those wrong), here's an update. You probably know me well enough by now to know that I disappear for a while, so I'm sorry if I missed anything that you've said to me!! Mamabug - your exercise check in comes to mind! I just got so overwhelmed last fall. Last september I DID go to the appointment with the resident neuro that was overseen by the head neuro that was/is an MS specialist, and that was the first MS specialist I've been able to see [I live 3 hours or more away from any MS specialist]. I left there SO DISCOURAGED by how I was treated [they were both very nice, but that's not the issue]. It just seemed like the resident neuro was really excited about getting to the bottom of my issues, but then the head guy came in and shot everything down. Instead of getting updated MRI scans like the resident neuro suggested, he said I needed some small fiber nerve test (the name escapes me). He also did some blood work for things like sjogren's and a few more autoimmune diseases that can show up in bloodwork. I looked everything up when I got back to the van (my friend drove me) and I literally fit NONE of them ... maybe I had one symptom from each, but it just proved to me that he did not listen to a word I said. To add insult to injury, he set the next appointment for 4 months. In my mind I'm thinking, ""4 months! That's 1/3 of a year away!"" Geesh. I already have anxiety about going ... and 4 months makes it easy to talk myself out of going. I was so stressed out, frustrated, anxious, discouraged, etc. All the tests came back negative (no surprise there), and I opted out of the follow up appointment. I just couldn't do it; it didn't ""feel right"" to me. In the meantime, I was finally approved for medicaid for disabled people. My GP gave me a referral to an MS center in St. Louis - Dr Green [MS Specialist]. My appointment with Dr Green was last week. This time instead of crying for frustration and discouragement, I cried for thankfulness. I have NEVER so far in this journey had a doctor that understood everything I was saying and going through, and in fact she could explain it better than me. She was shocked at how no one has gotten to the bottom of my problems. I reminded her that it's partially my fault for getting frustrated over and over again and giving up for years at a time before trying again. She felt like my frustration was justified because of all the feet-dragging and brick walls. She was also shocked that I have only had one scan of my neck and spine, and it was over 6 years ago. She said most of my symptoms would show activity in my spine, not my brain, so why has no one ordered an updated scan?!?!?! She actually seemed upset about it. I could understand her, she was thorough, and I liked her personality. I felt at ease with her, which really helped my issues with confusion and anxiety around doctors. Of course my friend was with me too - I always bring him so he can remember what was said and help add to the conversation. He liked her just as much as I did. She said she was going to get to the bottom of this once and for all. If it's MS, let's get it diagnosed. If it's not MS, let's figure it out and get that diagnosed. She told me to set up the neck and spine MRI for 2 weeks, and then set up an appointment with her right afterward. So, on the 14th I go in for the scans and then see her right after the scans at 11:30. That appointment with her will include the general neuro exam since all we did was talk during the first appointment. Could this be the end of it all?!?!? I sure hope so. Well, there it is. My walking continues to get worse, but with smart planning I can still [usually] get through my day ok. Lots of breaks and rest. Sometimes though I do have to rest pretty much all day. I try to get up and do something every hour or two, but sometimes that is too much. My son is fixing up a house for me that should be ready in a few months. Everything in it will pretty much be new, and will be set up just for me. I'm excited! We're all hoping it will make my life more peaceful. Though I am in my own place right now, it is still what we call ""grand central station"" - a hub of activity from my family that live on the same property. People come in on a whim, which usually interrupts the flow of my day and confuses me. I'll be moving to a whole new property where my youngest will be living, but our houses will be a good distance apart (I won't even be able to see his house from my house). My house will no longer be the center of activity, and my day will be much quieter. We all think a season of quiet will be really good for me. I used to be so social and love to host meals. I miss that, but oh well. That's just how life goes ... go with the flow, right?! That's all for now I guess. Thanks for your encouragement over the years! Hopefully soon I'll be out of limbo. Not officially diagnosed due to non-MS-specific spots on MRIs, but the neurologists all agree it's MS. January 2019: finally saw an MS specialist worth seeing. Maybe we'll get to the bottom of this. EDSS of 5.5, sometimes 6.0.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4704623429281806291/What-drives-patients-to-use-medical-marijuana:-mostly-chronic-pain	What drives patients to use medical marijuana: mostly chronic pain	"ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- Slowly but surely, the stigma surrounding marijuana use is losing its grip in the U.S. Since the 1990s, advocates have pushed for a re-evaluation of cannabis (the plant species name often used interchangeably with marijuana) as a viable treatment for a host of ailments. As of 2018, 33 states and the District of Columbia have approved the medical use of cannabis, while 10 states have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Despite this fact, at the federal level, marijuana remains a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substances Act, defined as a drug with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. New research from the University of Michigan, published in the February issue of Health Affairs , takes a deeper dive into state medical marijuana registry data to provide more insight into its use. ""We did this study because we wanted to understand the reasons why people are using cannabis medically, and whether those reasons for use are evidence based,"" says lead author Kevin Boehnke, Ph.D., research investigator in the department of anesthesiology and the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. He and his U-M colleagues Daniel J. Clauw, M.D., a professor of anesthesiology, medicine, and psychiatry and Rebecca L. Haffajee, Ph.D., assistant professor of health management and policy, as well as U-M alum Saurav Gangopadhyay, M.P.H., a consultant at Deloitte, sought out data from states with legalized medical use of marijuana. To examine patterns of use, the researchers grouped patient-reported qualifying conditions (i.e. the illnesses/medical conditions that allowed a patient to obtain a license) into evidence categories pulled from a recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report on cannabis and cannabinoids. The report, published in 2017, is a comprehensive review of 10,000 scientific abstracts on the health effects of medical and recreational cannabis use. According to the report, there was conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, and multiple sclerosis (MS) spasticity symptoms were improved as a result of cannabis treatment. One major finding of the Health Affairs paper was the variability of available data. Less than half of the states had data on patient-reported qualifying conditions and only 20 reported data on the number of registered patients. The authors also noted that the number of licensed medical users, with 641,176 registered medical cannabis patients in 2016 and 813,917 in 2017, was likely far lower than the actual number of users. However, with the available data, they found that the number of medical cannabis patients rose dramatically over time and that the vast majority -- 85.5 percent -- of medical cannabis license holders indicated that they were seeking treatment for an evidence-based condition, with chronic pain accounting for 62.2 percent of all patient-reported qualifying conditions. ""This finding is consistent with the prevalence of chronic pain, which affects an estimated 100 million Americans,"" the authors state. This research provides support for legitimate evidence-based use of cannabis that is at direct odds with its current drug schedule status, notes Boehnke. This is especially important as more people look for safer pain management alternatives in light of the current opioid epidemic. Notes Boehnke, ""Since the majority of states in the U.S. have legalized medical cannabis, we should consider how best to adequately regulate cannabis and safely incorporate cannabis into medical practice.""

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4704623429281237325/Study:-Medicare-rules-increase-out-of-pocket-costs-of-MS-drugs	Study: Medicare rules increase out-of-pocket costs of MS drugs	"Medicare patients with multiple sclerosis face skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs for therapies due to complicated insurance rules that force them to pick up an increasing share of the cost, according to new research. Despite recent efforts to constrain escalating costs, researchers with OHSU and the OHSU/Oregon State University College of Pharmacy in Portland, Oregon, found trends in insurance coverage that restrict access and saddle patients with increasing patient costs. Medicare beneficiaries without low-income subsidies can expect to spend $6,894 a year out of pocket for treatment of MS, concludes a study published in the February issue of the journal Health Affairs . ""It's a dysfunctional market that lacks the typical incentives for most other consumer products,"" said lead author Daniel Hartung, Pharm.D., M.P.H., associate professor in the OHSU/OSU College of Pharmacy. ""Aside from the public optics, there are few incentives for companies not to raise prices. Most intermediaries in the drug distribution channel, including drug companies, benefit from higher prices."" High prices negatively affect patients, even with insurance, because patient out-of-pocket costs are often directly tied to undiscounted drug list prices. Additionally, rising prices for MS therapies also seemed to correlate to increased use of restrictive policies by Medicare pharmacy plans. In one telling example, researchers documented how patients who are prescribed the only generic drug in one class - glatiramer acetate - will pay more out of pocket than patients using any of the other brand-name drugs in the same class. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 modified Medicare rules to reduce out-of-pocket costs for individuals through increased discounts provided by brand-name drug manufacturers. However, this change left individuals who use generic drugs with higher out-of-pocket costs for certain generic products. ""This is a pernicious effect of the release of a generic and an unfortunate effect of Medicare rules,"" said co-author Dennis Bourdette, M.D., professor and chair of neurology in the OHSU School of Medicine. The authors noted that a proposal by the Trump administration would reduce this incentive disparity between brand-name and generic drugs. Depending on drug utilization patterns, the authors expect the administration's suggested changes would reduce total out-of-pocket spending for beneficiaries. The study follows on previous research into the high cost of MS drugs led by Hartung and Bourdette. ""MS is emblematic of many chronic conditions whose treatment increasingly involves the use of high-cost specialty drugs that are often rigidly managed,"" the authors write. Researchers also examined changes in requirements for prior authorization, a common insurance company strategy intended to manage or limit access to certain drugs. The study noted that rates of pre-authorization have increased from 61 percent in 2007 to as high as 90 percent in 2016. Yet narrowing options doesn't necessarily work for MS patients, the authors write, noting American Academy of Neurology guidelines stress patients and providers should have access to all therapies because the effect varies from patient to patient. And, despite an increase in the number of therapies available to treat MS, the out-of-pocket cost to patients has continued to escalate. ""Despite increases in the number and diversity of disease-modifying therapies for MS, prices have risen rapidly over the past two decades,"" the authors write. ""The rise in high coinsurance cost-sharing models, coupled with escalating drug prices, means that patients will increasingly face prohibitive out-of-pocket spending.""

Feb 1 2019. A University of Oklahoma researcher, Si Wu, and collaborators from the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation and Indiana University, are developing new strategies leading to diagnosis and early intervention of Lupus, an autoimmune disease that may affect up to 1.5 million Americans. The National Institutes of Health is funding the OU research with a $2 million grant over a five-year period. ""We are providing the first snapshot of autoantibody development in Lupus patients by developing a novel detection method using a top-down mass spectrometry approach for identifying disease-specific autoantibodies quickly,"" said Wu, assistant professor, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, OU College of Arts and Sciences. ""This may lead to novel biomarkers and a foundation for new strategies for the early detection of Lupus. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply this approach in understanding how autoantibodies become pathogenic."" Ken Smith, OMRF investigator, is purifying antibodies from samples of over 50 patients from Oklahoma and surrounding states for this research. In collaboration with rheumatologists Judith James and Eliza Chakravarty, these longitudinal samples will come from well-characterized Lupus patients collected over several decades allowing for evaluation of the disease over time. Xiaowen Liu, associate professor in the School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, will work with Wu on the development of the needed software tools. Wu's research team has complementary expertise on top-down mass spectrometry, antibody immunity and bioinformatics. The team will look at antibodies of specific antoantigens to determine how the properties of the antibodies in individual patients over time and across patients are related. The researchers will link antibody clones with disease activity to determine how they change with the disease progression and various medications. The research team is providing the first quantitative top-down platform for characterizing these autoantibodies. After development, the top-down autoantibody characterization platform can be easily adapted to other autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren's Syndrome.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4703342300473368340/Research-may-provide-a-new-way-to-treat-organ-scarring	Research may provide a new way to treat organ scarring	Reviewed by James Ives, MPsych Feb 1 2019. Scientists from Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Department of Medicine 3 - Rheumatology and Immunology, headed by Prof. Dr. Georg Schett, have now decrypted a molecular network that controls these processes and could in future provide a new way to treat organ scarring. The results show that the protein PU.1 causes pathological deposition of connective tissue. The scientists have now published their results in the renowned journal Nature . In connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis, referred to collectively as 'fibrosis', excessive activation of connective tissue cells leads to hardening of the tissue and scarring within the affected organ. In principle, these diseases can affect any organ system and very often lead to disruption of organ function. Connective tissue cells play a key role in normal wound healing in healthy individuals. However, if the activation of connective tissue cells cannot be switched off, fibrotic diseases occur, in which an enormous amount of matrix is deposited in the tissue, leading to scarring and dysfunction of the affected tissue. Until now, scientists did not fully understand why repair processes malfunction in fibrotic diseases. An international team of scientists led by Dr. Andreas Ramming from the Chair of Internal Medicine III at FAU has now been able to decipher a molecular mechanism responsible for the ongoing activation of connective tissue cells. In experimental studies, the researchers targeted the protein PU.1. In normal wound healing, the formation of PU.1 is inhibited by the body so that at the end of the normal healing process the connective tissue cells can return to a resting state. 'We were able to show that PU.1 is activated in various connective tissue diseases in the skin, lungs, liver and kidneys. PU.1 binds to the DNA in the connective tissue cells and reprogrammes them, resulting in a prolonged deposition of tissue components,' explains Dr. Ramming. PU.1 is not the only factor involved in fibrosis, as factors that are involved in the deposition of scar tissue have already been identified in the past. What has been discovered now, however, is that PU.1 plays a central role in a network of factors controlling this process. 'PU.1 is like the conductor in an orchestra,' explains Ramming, 'if you take it out, the entire concert collapses.' This approach has already been tested using an experimental drug, fuelling the hope that clinical trials on inhibiting PU.1 may soon be able to be launched, aimed at treating fibrosis better. 	0	0	Research|may|provide|a|new|way|to|treat|organ|scarring	Reviewed|by|James|Ives|,|MPsych|Feb|1|2019|.|Scientists|from|Friedrich-Alexander-Universität|Erlangen-Nürnberg|(|FAU|)|,|Department|of|Medicine|3|-|Rheumatology|and|Immunology|,|headed|by|Prof|.|Dr|.|Georg|Schett|,|have|now|decrypted|a|molecular|network|that|controls|these|processes|and|could|in|future|provide|a|new|way|to|treat|organ|scarring|.|The|results|show|that|the|protein|PU|.|1|causes|pathological|deposition|of|connective|tissue|.|The|scientists|have|now|published|their|results|in|the|renowned|journal|Nature|.|In|connective|tissue|diseases|such|as|systemic|sclerosis|,|referred|to|collectively|as|'|fibrosis|'|,|excessive|activation|of|connective|tissue|cells|leads|to|hardening|of|the|tissue|and|scarring|within|the|affected|organ|.|In|principle|,|these|diseases|can|affect|any|organ|system|and|very|often|lead|to|disruption|of|organ|function|.|Connective|tissue|cells|play|a|key|role|in|normal|wound|healing|in|healthy|individuals|.|However|,|if|the|activation|of|connective|tissue|cells|cannot|be|switched|off|,|fibrotic|diseases|occur|,|in|which|an|enormous|amount|of|matrix|is|deposited|in|the|tissue|,|leading|to|scarring|and|dysfunction|of|the|affected|tissue|.|Until|now|,|scientists|did|not|fully|understand|why|repair|processes|malfunction|in|fibrotic|diseases|.|An|international|team|of|scientists|led|by|Dr|.|Andreas|Ramming|from|the|Chair|of|Internal|Medicine|III|at|FAU|has|now|been|able|to|decipher|a|molecular|mechanism|responsible|for|the|ongoing|activation|of|connective|tissue|cells|.|In|experimental|studies|,|the|researchers|targeted|the|protein|PU|.|1|.|In|normal|wound|healing|,|the|formation|of|PU|.|1|is|inhibited|by|the|body|so|that|at|the|end|of|the|normal|healing|process|the|connective|tissue|cells|can|return|to|a|resting|state|.|'|We|were|able|to|show|that|PU|.|1|is|activated|in|various|connective|tissue|diseases|in|the|skin|,|lungs|,|liver|and|kidneys|.|PU|.|1|binds|to|the|DNA|in|the|connective|tissue|cells|and|reprogrammes|them|,|resulting|in|a|prolonged|deposition|of|tissue|components|,|'|explains|Dr|.|Ramming|.|PU|.|1|is|not|the|only|factor|involved|in|fibrosis|,|as|factors|that|are|involved|in|the|deposition|of|scar|tissue|have|already|been|identified|in|the|past|.|What|has|been|discovered|now|,|however|,|is|that|PU|.|1|plays|a|central|role|in|a|network|of|factors|controlling|this|process|.|'|PU|.|1|is|like|the|conductor|in|an|orchestra|,|'|explains|Ramming|,|'|if|you|take|it|out|,|the|entire|concert|collapses|.|'|This|approach|has|already|been|tested|using|an|experimental|drug|,|fuelling|the|hope|that|clinical|trials|on|inhibiting|PU|.|1|may|soon|be|able|to|be|launched|,|aimed|at|treating|fibrosis|better|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702808255598781585/Human-milk-is-a-'life-saving-intervention'-for-infants-with-congenital-heart-disease	Human milk is a 'life-saving intervention' for infants with congenital heart disease	"January 30, 2019 - With a lower risk of serious complications and improved feeding and growth outcomes, human milk is strongly preferred as the best diet for infants with congenital heart disease (CHD), according to a research review in Advances in Neonatal Care , official journal of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses . The journal is published in the Lippincott portfolio by Wolters Kluwer . Jessica A. Davis, BSN, RN, CCRN, IBCLC, of UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and Diane L. Spatz PhD, RN-BC, FAAN, of University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, Philadelphia, reviewed and analyzed six studies on the benefits of human milk and breast-feeding for infants with CHD. They conclude, ""Due to the overwhelming evidence of improved outcomes related to human milk feeing for critically ill infants, human milk should be considered a medical intervention for infants with CHD."" 'Mother's Own Milk' Is Recommended Feeding for Babies with CHD. Congenital heart disease is the most common category of birth defects, diagnosed in an estimated 1 in 1,000 newborns and infants each year. But while the benefits of human milk for premature and healthy infants are well documented, there is limited data on its role in improving outcomes for infants with CHD. The researchers examined evidence on the benefits of human milk on key outcomes for infants with CHD. * Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious complication in which there is damage to the intestines. Based on studies showing that an exclusively human milk diet can reduce the incidence of NEC in premature infants, the same recommendation applies to infants with CHD. * Chylothorax is a rare complication of chest surgery characterized by abnormal drainage of lymph fluid around the lungs, with a risk of severe adverse outcomes. Studies have shown that skimming the fat from the mother's own milk allows infants to continue receiving a human milk diet during treatment for chylothorax. ""Human milk is important to protect the infant with CHD from infection, decrease the risk of NEC, improve feeding tolerance, and protect the infant's brain/improve developmental outcomes,"" Ms. Davis and Dr. Spatz write. Based on this evidence, they believe that healthcare professionals have an ethical duty to help families make an informed decision about feeding for their infant with CHD,. The authors outline Dr. Spatz's 10-step model to promote and protect human milk feeding and breastfeeding for infants with CHD. Recommendations include steps to ensure initiation and maintenance of the mother's milk supply, either by breastfeeding or pumping. If necessary, pasteurized donated human milk can serve as a bridge to the mother's own milk. Other steps including ensuring skin-to-skin contact as soon as possible after birth and supporting mothers' ability to breastfeed and monitor their infant's milk intake and growth.

""Human milk is a life-saving intervention for infants with CHD and health professionals must prioritize helping families to make an informed feeding decision and ensure that mothers of infants with CHD can reach their personal breastfeeding goals,"" states Dr. Spatz.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702737254196702962/Chromatrap-partners-with-Covaris-to-offer-highly-scalable-and-simple-ChIP-workflow	Chromatrap partners with Covaris to offer highly scalable and simple ChIP workflow	Jan 30 2019. Chromatrap ® has entered into a partnership with Covaris to offer a highly scalable and simple ChIP workflow enabling researchers to easily isolate protein-DNA complexes for downstream applications, such as ChIP-Seq, ChIP-qPCR, Next-generation sequencing (NGS), and Mass Spectrometry (MS). Preparing samples for Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) has traditionally been a multi-step, time-consuming, and error-prone workflow. Pairing the bead-free Chromatrap immunoprecipitation system with the Covaris truChIP ® and AFA ® sample preparation technologies enables investigators to rapidly profile protein-DNA interactions of interest. By combining the two technologies, researchers now have access to a compatible and optimized workflow that increases productivity and allows the user to gain better results with higher quality samples. Chromatrap, the revolutionary automation-compatible spin column-based approach eliminates many of the challenges encountered when working with magnetic beads. This rapid centrifugation-based protocol requires only 3 simple washes using individual spin columns or 96-well plates and can be completed in a single day. In contrast, typical bead-based workflows take around 10 hours with over 10 wash steps and incubations. Using the Covaris Adaptive Focused Acoustics ® (AFA ® ) technology, researchers can easily isolate and reproducibly shear soluble chromatin without disrupting the protein-DNA interactions for immunoprecipitation with bead-free Chromatrap Protein A and G ChIP kits. 	0	0	Chromatrap|partners|with|Covaris|to|offer|highly|scalable|and|simple|ChIP|workflow	Jan|30|2019|.|Chromatrap|®|has|entered|into|a|partnership|with|Covaris|to|offer|a|highly|scalable|and|simple|ChIP|workflow|enabling|researchers|to|easily|isolate|protein-DNA|complexes|for|downstream|applications|,|such|as|ChIP-Seq|,|ChIP-qPCR|,|Next-generation|sequencing|(|NGS|)|,|and|Mass|Spectrometry|(|MS|)|.|Preparing|samples|for|Chromatin|Immunoprecipitation|(|ChIP|)|has|traditionally|been|a|multi-step|,|time-consuming|,|and|error-prone|workflow|.|Pairing|the|bead-free|Chromatrap|immunoprecipitation|system|with|the|Covaris|truChIP|®|and|AFA|®|sample|preparation|technologies|enables|investigators|to|rapidly|profile|protein-DNA|interactions|of|interest|.|By|combining|the|two|technologies|,|researchers|now|have|access|to|a|compatible|and|optimized|workflow|that|increases|productivity|and|allows|the|user|to|gain|better|results|with|higher|quality|samples|.|Chromatrap|,|the|revolutionary|automation-compatible|spin|column-based|approach|eliminates|many|of|the|challenges|encountered|when|working|with|magnetic|beads|.|This|rapid|centrifugation-based|protocol|requires|only|3|simple|washes|using|individual|spin|columns|or|96|-|well|plates|and|can|be|completed|in|a|single|day|.|In|contrast|,|typical|bead-based|workflows|take|around|10|hours|with|over|10|wash|steps|and|incubations|.|Using|the|Covaris|Adaptive|Focused|Acoustics|®|(|AFA|®|)|technology|,|researchers|can|easily|isolate|and|reproducibly|shear|soluble|chromatin|without|disrupting|the|protein-DNA|interactions|for|immunoprecipitation|with|bead-free|Chromatrap|Protein|A|and|G|ChIP|kits|.

These cells produce myelin (green), which they then use to repair the myelin sheaths around nerve cells. Blue staining depicts nuclei. Credit: Staroßom/Charité. Diseases such as multiple sclerosis are characterized by damage to the myelin sheath, a protective covering wrapped around nerve cells akin to insulation around an electrical wire. Researchers from Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin have discovered how the body initiates repair mechanisms to limit the extent of any damage to this sheath. Their findings, which provide a basis for the development of new drugs to treat multiple sclerosis, have been published in Nature Communications . Multiple sclerosis is the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Estimates suggest that more than 200,000 people are affected by the disease in Germany alone. People with multiple sclerosis experience vision and sensory problems, as well as impaired coordination or even paralysis. These symptoms are caused by the disruption of nerve impulses in either the brain or the spinal cord. This disruption occurs when the body's immune system attacks the myelin sheath, which is wrapped around the body's nerve fibers and provides electrical insulation. When the myelin sheath is no longer intact, communication between nerve cells is impaired. Researchers across the globe are searching for new ways to repair the myelin sheath and, in doing so, are looking to reduce neurological symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis. Researchers from Charité have now moved a decisive step closer to this goal. Charité's research team decided to take a closer look at the body's innate ability to heal itself, knowing that, under certain conditions, the central nervous system is capable of repairing damage to the myelin sheath . Specific molecular signals enable stem cells to differentiate into myelin repair cells (oligodendrocytes), which reside in a small stem-cell niche in the brain. Once they leave this niche, these repair cells migrate to where myelin damage has occurred in order to restore the affected nerve cells' electrical insulation. Until now, very little had been known about the molecular signals responsible for initiating this myelin regeneration mechanism. ""We have found that the Chi3l3 protein plays a central role in the body's capacity to produce new myelin-forming oligodendrocytes,"" says the study's first author, Dr. Sarah-Christin Staroßom of Charité's Institute for Medical Immunology. A researcher at the NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence and the Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Dr. Staroßom explains the protein's role as follows: ""The Chi3l3 protein initiates the differentiation of neural stem cells into myelin repair cells, which restore the electrical insulation around damaged nerve cells ."" Using a mouse model , the research team were able to show that a reduction in Chi3l3 levels in the brain significantly impairs the body's capacity for oligodendrocyte production, while a Chi3l3 infusion leads to an increase in the production of myelin repair cells. The same reaction was observed during an in vitro experiment using human cells . ""We hope to use this knowledge to develop a new generation of drugs that can be used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis,"" explains Dr. Staroßom. ""As a next step, we will study in greater detail whether Chi3l3 or related proteins can be used to reduce the neurological symptoms of patients with multiple sclerosis. :::::::.

As I’m a single parent, I want to remain healthy for a as long as possible. I’ve been thinking of changing to one of the newer and supposedly more effective drugs but I’m very concerned about the cancer and PML risks. I’m a nurse so I’m always surrounded by bugs from my workplace.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702813046349079078/New-and-Concerned	New and Concerned	"Good Evening Everyone,. My name is Jason and I am a band director at a large high school in Florida. I am 32 years old. I have had some very strange symptoms for about a year. However, looking back at least four years, MS can explain a lot of things that have happened in my life. I am not sure what I should do. I am looking for guidance on what to do. Who should I see, would they even take me seriously? I have the following symptoms:. 1. Random patches of numbness that come and go. The most likely places are on my hands and feet (Peripheral Neuropathy) This is always like a half numbness. It is very annoying. It has gotten to the point where my hands and feet are almost always half numb. It seems when I touch things or hold things whatever is being touched turns numb as well. I have had these random patches of numbness just about everywhere on my body at some point. I also have an altered state of touch. Very strange sensations. 2. I have always been highly intelligent. However, I have noticed in the last year that I often have brain fog. My recall of information has become poor. Especially words. I know exactly what I want to say, I can see it in my mind but it never comes out. Oddly enough it comes out as something completely different. For example, last night I went to a restaurant and I asked my fiance where she found the forks. What came out was ""Where did you find the straws?"" I say it with such conviction because I am so sure of what I wanted to say but it is wrong. This sort of thing has been happening with increased frequency and it appears to be getting worse as time goes on. Furthermore, I will be in class teaching and writing on the whiteboard simultaneously but what I am saying and what I am writing are two completely different things. 3. Vision issues. I had 20/15 vision for most of my life until about five years ago or so I started losing my distance vision. In the last year I feel like my vision has depreciated at an alarming rate. It is no longer just distance vision but all vision. My right eye is especially bad. In the right eye it almost seems as if colors are washed out and greyish. Furthermore, I feel like I have lost some peripheral vision. 4. Fine motor skills. I feel like I am slowly losing my fine motor skills. Little things like texting on a phone and typing this message seem much more difficult than they used to. I have slowed down significantly and make a plethora of mistakes. Things I have done so much just feel strange. 5. Movement. I have noticed a significant decrease in my walking speed and my gait seems to have changed. I am well aware of it but it is nothing I am consciously doing. This is not significant but noticeable. I feel much stiffer than I used to. 6. Involuntary twitching. My newest symptom is involuntary twitching. It started in my right eyelid about three weeks ago and sometimes spreads down my cheeks. This is intermittent and does not happen all the time but definitely a neurological issue. 7. Dizziness and vertigo. This one comes and goes but sometimes it can be pretty severe. Sometimes it happens while I am driving and I fear for my life. This is one of those symptoms that I had four years ago that could have been my first episode. I had about three months of debilitating dizziness and vertigo. I had to sit down at work while teaching. It was just awful. Doctors could not explain it but they certainly didn't do anything outside of a blood test. 8. Other cognitive deficiencies. I have noticed it is much more difficult to focus and have developed some ADD tendencies. I used to be able to multitask and get stuff done better than most people I know. It is getting harder. Remembering names is becoming an issue sometimes as well. Names of people I see and communicate with every day like my students. 9. Pain. I have had numerous injuries in my life that can explain pain but most of them are really old injuries. I have more pain than someone my age should ever have to endure. I do not know if this is related or not. Bowel problems. I am almost always constipated and I drink a lot of water and eat fairly well. I currently have a recurrent cholesteatoma in my left ear that needs to be surgically removed soon but it does not explain any of these symptoms as it is not in brain. What do you all think and what should I do from here? Any advice would be really appreciated. I have seen my primary physician and they basically turned me away. Thank you for your time!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4712370275396497605/Heres-how-not-to-be-an-idiot---like-me-----Page-2	Here’s how not to be an idiot - like me - - Page 2	Hello Mable,. Why did Giavononni wait to tell a patient that brain loss volume leads to disability? I have no idea; I can only speculate. But I congratulate him for talking about it now. His website has a monthly Q & A section where that question can be asked. Brain atrophy as a clinical endpoint in DMT trials has only been introduced in the last few years. Before recently not much attention was given brain loss volume. Unlikely that many neuros have discussed it with their patients, unfortunately. However, going forward I believe brain atrophy will be discussed in the context of which DMT to choose; it is just now beginning to be recognized as a vitally important factor relative to disability. Gilenya is better at reducing brain loss volume (BLV) than most DMTs although I personally would not choose Gilenya if I had MS. But the particular patient mentioned was NEDA on it, Mable, so for her it was/is effective. All the other DMTs for MS are worse than Gilenya in reducing BLV except those Giavononni listed … HSCT and Lemtrada 0.2-0.25%, Tysabri 0.25-0.3%, Ocrevus 0.35%, Gilenya at 0.4%. So, what should this patient on Gilenya be taking instead of Gilenya? That is a tough question because she is NEDA on it and her response to the others cannot be precisely predicted. With DMTs there are patients who develop neutralizing antibodies which render a DMT useless or even counterproductive. HSCT is not widely available even though, IMO it is clearly the most successful DMT. Next on my list is Tysabri; not Lemtrada even though some do very, very well on Lemtrada. With Lemtrada most people (but not all) will battle significant secondary immunity problems. That is why Lemtrada gives me pause. With those thoughts in mind, Tysabri would be my choice whether I was JCV positive, or negative. Before going on dose extension with Tysabri (btw, convincing the neuro literally nearly took fist-fighting; our arguments were that intense, he finally caved, learned, or something and agreed that dose extension de-risks for PML. The lesson here is that sometimes you actually have to fight or change doctors for what you are convinced of, as Linda explained in her post) and before switching to Ocrevus my spouse had received more infusions of Tysabri than anyone in the world according to her neurologist. Ocrevus is a very, very good DMT but not quite as effective as Tysabri in reducing fatigue and BLV. The PML aspect often scares patients away from Tysabri when MS progression should be leading MSers toward Tysabri, IMO. IMO, HSCT is the best option. But if HSCT is not available, Tysabri is the next best, IMO. Please keep in mind not every DMT works well for every patient. My opinion is based on experience in my household and results found in DMT trial and real-world data. Isn’t it fun choosing a DMT? It would challenge Solomon. Choices can be narrowed down by prioritizing what is most important to an individual but it still can seem like a crap shoot. Good luck and certainly, you have my best wishes! Oh, one last point… we all lose brain volume as we age. In one scientific study the BLV per year was “0.20% at the age of 35 years increasing to 0.52% at 70 years” in healthy subjects. Often, BLV in MS is listed at 0.7% and higher. So, the best DMTs get that rate at very near normal. Recall even Gilenya was at 0.4%. In the near future, BLV will be used as a marker for how well a DMT is doing for a particular patient, I’m certain. 	1	1	Here|’|s|how|not|to|be|an|idiot|-|like|me|-|-|Page|2	Hello|Mable|,|.|Why|did|Giavononni|wait|to|tell|a|patient|that|brain|loss|volume|leads|to|disability|?|I|have|no|idea|;|I|can|only|speculate|.|But|I|congratulate|him|for|talking|about|it|now|.|His|website|has|a|monthly|Q|&|A|section|where|that|question|can|be|asked|.|Brain|atrophy|as|a|clinical|endpoint|in|DMT|trials|has|only|been|introduced|in|the|last|few|years|.|Before|recently|not|much|attention|was|given|brain|loss|volume|.|Unlikely|that|many|neuros|have|discussed|it|with|their|patients|,|unfortunately|.|However|,|going|forward|I|believe|brain|atrophy|will|be|discussed|in|the|context|of|which|DMT|to|choose|;|it|is|just|now|beginning|to|be|recognized|as|a|vitally|important|factor|relative|to|disability|.|Gilenya|is|better|at|reducing|brain|loss|volume|(|BLV|)|than|most|DMTs|although|I|personally|would|not|choose|Gilenya|if|I|had|MS|.|But|the|particular|patient|mentioned|was|NEDA|on|it|,|Mable|,|so|for|her|it|was|/|is|effective|.|All|the|other|DMTs|for|MS|are|worse|than|Gilenya|in|reducing|BLV|except|those|Giavononni|listed|…|HSCT|and|Lemtrada|0.2-|0.25|%|,|Tysabri|0.25-|0.3|%|,|Ocrevus|0.35|%|,|Gilenya|at|0.4|%|.|So|,|what|should|this|patient|on|Gilenya|be|taking|instead|of|Gilenya|?|That|is|a|tough|question|because|she|is|NEDA|on|it|and|her|response|to|the|others|cannot|be|precisely|predicted|.|With|DMTs|there|are|patients|who|develop|neutralizing|antibodies|which|render|a|DMT|useless|or|even|counterproductive|.|HSCT|is|not|widely|available|even|though|,|IMO|it|is|clearly|the|most|successful|DMT|.|Next|on|my|list|is|Tysabri|;|not|Lemtrada|even|though|some|do|very|,|very|well|on|Lemtrada|.|With|Lemtrada|most|people|(|but|not|all|)|will|battle|significant|secondary|immunity|problems|.|That|is|why|Lemtrada|gives|me|pause|.|With|those|thoughts|in|mind|,|Tysabri|would|be|my|choice|whether|I|was|JCV|positive|,|or|negative|.|Before|going|on|dose|extension|with|Tysabri|(|btw|,|convincing|the|neuro|literally|nearly|took|fist-fighting|;|our|arguments|were|that|intense|,|he|finally|caved|,|learned|,|or|something|and|agreed|that|dose|extension|de-risks|for|PML|.|The|lesson|here|is|that|sometimes|you|actually|have|to|fight|or|change|doctors|for|what|you|are|convinced|of|,|as|Linda|explained|in|her|post|)|and|before|switching|to|Ocrevus|my|spouse|had|received|more|infusions|of|Tysabri|than|anyone|in|the|world|according|to|her|neurologist|.|Ocrevus|is|a|very|,|very|good|DMT|but|not|quite|as|effective|as|Tysabri|in|reducing|fatigue|and|BLV|.|The|PML|aspect|often|scares|patients|away|from|Tysabri|when|MS|progression|should|be|leading|MSers|toward|Tysabri|,|IMO|.|IMO|,|HSCT|is|the|best|option|.|But|if|HSCT|is|not|available|,|Tysabri|is|the|next|best|,|IMO|.|Please|keep|in|mind|not|every|DMT|works|well|for|every|patient|.|My|opinion|is|based|on|experience|in|my|household|and|results|found|in|DMT|trial|and|real-world|data|.|Isn|’|t|it|fun|choosing|a|DMT|?|It|would|challenge|Solomon|.|Choices|can|be|narrowed|down|by|prioritizing|what|is|most|important|to|an|individual|but|it|still|can|seem|like|a|crap|shoot|.|Good|luck|and|certainly|,|you|have|my|best|wishes|!|Oh|,|one|last|point|…|we|all|lose|brain|volume|as|we|age|.|In|one|scientific|study|the|BLV|per|year|was|“|0.20|%|at|the|age|of|35|years|increasing|to|0.52|%|at|70|years|”|in|healthy|subjects|.|Often|,|BLV|in|MS|is|listed|at|0.7|%|and|higher|.|So|,|the|best|DMTs|get|that|rate|at|very|near|normal|.|Recall|even|Gilenya|was|at|0.4|%|.|In|the|near|future|,|BLV|will|be|used|as|a|marker|for|how|well|a|DMT|is|doing|for|a|particular|patient|,|I|’|m|certain|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4701214689985418570/UMN-researchers-refine-the-ability-to-predict-atrial-fibrillation-related-stroke	UMN researchers refine the ability to predict atrial fibrillation-related stroke	"MINNEAPOLIS, MN- January 25, 2019 - Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is associated with a 5-fold increased risk of stroke. Nearly 3 million Americans are living with AFib. For years, researchers have been looking for ways to reduce the risk of stroke for this patient population. In a recent article published in Circulation , Lin Yee Chen, MD, MS, Associate Professor with tenure, Cardiovascular Division, in the Department of Medicine with the University of Minnesota Medical School demonstrates how to improve the prediction of stroke in patients with AFib. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a prediction tool that is commonly used to stratify the risk of stroke in patients with AFib. In this article, Dr. Chen and colleagues reported that in people with AFib, abnormal P-wave indices during sinus rhythm are associated with stroke independent of CHA2DS2- VASc variables. They did this by investigating groups of P-wave indices and tested their association with the risk of stroke in two population based cohort studies known as ARIC and MESA. They also came up with a scoring system known as P2-CHA2DS2-VASc score. ""We now possibly have a better scoring system that we can use to more accurately classify which patients with AFib are at higher risk of stroke, and who may require treatment to prevent stroke,"" explained Dr. Chen. This discovery was a culmination of years of work, which grant funding (R01HL126637 and R01HL141288 from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute) allowed Chen to take to the next level. ""We hope to transform care for patients with AFib, but there is still additional research to be done,"" said Chen. ""For example, we need more studies to confirm the reproducibility of P wave axis. In other words, if I did an ECG today and I repeat the ECG one week later, will it report the same number for the P wave axis?"" This discovery by Chen and colleagues is an important step and one which could have a big impact on the management of AFib because the P2-CHA2DS2-VASc score is easy to use and can be applied to a very wide community.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4700905936800904788/LJI-awarded-22-million-contract-renewal-to-host-and-expand-Immune-Epitope-Database	LJI awarded $22 million contract renewal to host and expand Immune Epitope Database	"Reviewed by James Ives, MPsych Jan 24 2019. La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) has been awarded a $22 million contract renewal over seven years from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to host and expand the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). The database is the world's most comprehensive collection of scientific data on how the immune system responds to a wide range of infectious agents, allergy-causing substances, and other stimuli that activate the immune system. Co-led since its inception in 2003 by LJI professors Alessandro Sette, Dr. Sci. Biol., and Bjoern Peters, Ph.D., the IEDB gives biomedical researchers worldwide free access to a rapidly growing catalogue of epitopes--the specific, molecular structures that the immune system uses to tell friend from foe--involved in autoimmunity, infectious and allergic diseases, as well as organ and tissue transplantation. The current seven-year renewal enables LJI to continue its role as host and developer of the IEDB through 2025. ""At the end of the current funding period, the database will have been collecting data for almost a quarter century,"" says Sette, professor and head of the Division of Vaccine Discovery. ""NIH's continued commitment and support is not only a testament to the quality and importance of this unique resource, but also a clear mandate to take the IEDB to the next level."" As of January, 2019, the database contains over 530,000 epitopes representing some 3,600 different species--including humans, non-human primates, rodents, and other vertebrates--making it the largest data set of its kind. Bringing this vast amount of data together in a single resource allows researchers to unlock clues to the causes of disease by searching for commonalities and recurring patterns that differentiate them. The IEDB has become an established and widely used resource, receiving hundreds of queries from researchers worldwide who are designing new or improved vaccines against infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, and new treatments for autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. In recent years, the explosion of increasingly large and complex data sets pouring out of labs and captured by the IEDB has created a new set of challenges. ""Managing the massive amount of information has required the automation of processes and a rethinking of how the data is organized,"" says Peters. ""We have millions of records and the big question becomes how do we synthesize the information to go from data to knowledge? Going forward, that's where our focus will be."" In addition to collecting data, the IEDB also provides tools that allow researchers to make predictions about epitopes, which is particularly useful for newly emerging or constantly evolving infectious diseases, such as Zika and influenza, as well as ongoing biodefense concerns. Together, the database and the tools play a critical role in the fight to improve and safeguard global public health. ""Lessons learned in the context of infectious diseases have led to the development of tools that are now applied broadly to developing highly personalized immunotherapy treatments,"" says Peters, a bioinformatician, who has developed a number of tools to predict and analyze which parts of a pathogen, allergen, or cancer cell are recognized and targeted by the immune system.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4700689093432693714/Special-Threads-For-VIP-Members	Special Threads For VIP Members	Originally Posted by IntoDust .... I see your point, but I look at it a little differently. If we knew someone who needed to use a wheelchair, yet kept refusing to admit the need for one, eventually we would stop trying to pick them up off the floor - especially if they were adamant that they didn't need help. How many times would people be willing to break their backs for someone who not only doesn't appreciate it, but refuses to acknowledge it? I have reached out to people on this board that rebuffed my offer of help and /or ignored,or even refused to acknowledge what I was trying to say. As I have a strict budget on my use of 'spoons' I felt that it was on them at that point. And so I bowed out of their concerns. If they figure it out then great, if not then I feel that I have invested all that I am willing to invest. At that point I find somewhere else to invest my interest - or even start a thread about something that interest me. Originally Posted by IntoDust. The difference, I think, is that while you can ignore numb patches or tingling, it is another thing to try to ignore symptoms that affect how you function - whether this is physical or mental, motor or cognitive. Some symptoms have a real impact on quality of life even if they are invisible. The VIP that you are talking about actually has, IMHO, managed to find a way to survive. A little denial? But she is living a productive full life to the best of her ability, and is even 'happy' at times now. After 25 years MS dx, most people wouldn't guess that I have MS - or any other chronic disease (I have 3). Do I ignore these conditions? Yeah, I suppose that I do most of the time. I take my meds, eat correctly and make an effort to move every day. And I too live a full productive life. I am not in denial. I will speak about MS, diabetes or thyroid problems to anybody that has a desire to listen, but it is not my focus in life. I have too much else going on that is, at this point in my life, more important to me. It took me about a year to learn to function after my MS dx (but a year just happens to be the AVERAGE amount of time) and there are still times when I find myself starting the 'grief cycle' all over again. At least now I know what to expect and so these dark periods don't last as long as they have in the past. That lesson comes from experience and acceptance. Unfortunately those are traits that each person has to acquire on their own - in their own time. I am sorry that you do not feel safe to post, and that you have felt slighted by other members on the board. I apologize that I haven't responded to more of your posts, but honestly, if I feel that I have nothing to contribute then I simply read. I would rather not give out misinformation, or even worse incorrect info . I mainly post about my personal experiences or offer moral support. I try to keep in mind the principle behind this board rather than the personalities involved. MSWorld was created by people with MS to help people with MS. Think about it like going to an office party. You go for whatever reason, but will most likely NOT interact with everybody there. There may even be some things going on that you chose not to participate in, but that does not mean that you can't still have a good time. That is too simplistic and not really dead on, but maybe you can understand what I am trying to convey.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4700638695122931468/MS-Ireland--::-Helping-Everyone-Affected-by-Multiple-Sclerosis	MS Ireland  :: Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis	"MS Ireland  ::. Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Why I “Look So Good"" Thursday January 24 2019 10:00 AM. This week Trevis Gleason deals with familiar, often unwelcome, phrases people with MS hear very often. Nearly everyone who has MS has heard “You don’t look sick” or “But you look so good….” Well, I’ll tell you why. It’s well into the third week of January and I’m still hearing a lot of “Happy New Year” greetings. It’s not because people are stuck in a rut or have forgotten that they’ve seen me about town. It’s the first time I’ve been seen by many in our close-knit community. I’ve had a tough go of it since just after Christmas. MS and MS-related setbacks have kept me mostly at home for the past several weeks. What I’ve been hearing alongside those New Year greetings has been the acknowledgement that I have been missing from the everyday life of the town. Many suppose that I’ve been away on holidays or traveling for work. I’ve come to realise that this is the flipside of the “You look so good” coin. We ‘look so good’, not because we are ‘good’ all the time; rather because we only get out when we are on the good side of the MS spectrum. Firstly, the broader public doesn’t see our invisible symptoms. They also don’t see the effort – oft Herculean – to get ourselves out the door and into the community. The people we meet also don’t realise that our interaction with them may be the only one we have for the whole day. It’s not a full trip to the shops we’re making, we’re simply out to get milk before we must return for an anesthesia-like recovery nap. Then, as I’ve experienced this week, people just don’t realise that we’re not out all of the time. People who see us at work mightn’t know that the seven or eight hours we are with them are the only hours in the day when we aren’t wrecked beyond recognition. That the anti-fatigue meds mask to the world the truth of what we felt like before the meds kicked in. Those loan-shark meds will be demanding heavy interest when they wear off in the evening. Finally, the world only sees us as looking good because that’s what they want to see. They’re not looking very hard if they don’t see than I’m not ‘okay’. I know this doesn’t fit for everyone out there. The truth, however, is that our world needs to see that everything is okay. Those who know us moderately well may have known us ‘before’ and it’s important that we’re fine because if something like MS happens to them, they need to feel like they’ll be fine too. Our disease makes people face their own frailties. It’s the same reason cancer was whispered about, if it were ever talked about, in decades past. People don’t want to know that it could happen to them… as a species, we get spooked very easily. Part of the reason people see us as they do is because of the face we put on for the world . There as many reasons we put on the “I’m fine” mask as there are people living with MS. We do it because we need to stay employed, because we don’t want our children/spouses/family/friends to worry, because we don’t want to admit to ourselves that it’s got as bad as it has. That list could go on for pages…. I can’t (or at least don’t) give my list to people who mention that I look good or ask if I’ve been away. I’d be a very off-putting bore were I to spout off all of the above information to the casual acquaintance! It’s one of the reasons the MS & Me blog and other places where we can be ourselves with others who simply get it are so important. We’re not always fine, well, okay, or even good … but that doesn’t stop us from trying to be those things. I just wish we’d all do that a little more for ourselves than only for those in our lives who need them from us. Wishing you and your family the best of health.

Next Thread ❭ ❭. Joined : Aug 2017. Posts : 135. Posted 1/21/2019 5:47 PM (GMT -7). I've been on the UC board for several months given my diagnosis of UC back in 2016. I've been flaring since and finally got things reasonably under control with Entyvio. That treatment got me to about 70% effectiveness so we have been looking for the final 30% to get remission. My doctor prescribed Methotrexate 25/mg a week. I had tried similar drugs such as Azathroprine and 6mp and both made me sick including vomiting. So my doctor knew that Methotrexate could be a problem. I also take Canasa suppositories usually every other night. I am now dealing with what I feel like is a lot of constipation. I am very frequently bloated and have a good deal of abdominal pain. My doctor has floated IBS as a possible problem before but he seems more concerned with the IBD. He did prescribe me an anti-depressant in a very low dosage. In all honesty, I do not want to take an anti-depressant regardless of dosage so I have not tried that yet. To me, I am still new with this IBS thing, I'm still learning a lot about IBD. My big question is, is there a way to get tested to find if I have IBS? I would like to know if these problems I'm having are more Methotrexate side effects or IBS related. Is that answer to work with my doctor and stop taking the Methotrexate all together and see what happens? I wasnt sure if there was some type of blood test or breath test, or some other type of test that might be able to shed light on IBS? Joined : Feb 2003. Posts : 17132. Posted 1/21/2019 6:32 PM (GMT -7). I happened to see your post & wanted to respond to you. It's pretty common for someone with IBD have IBS. Dealing with the disease alone is bad enough, but add in IBS it's not a picnic. My daughter in law suffered with IBS for years, her issue was constipation & bloating. She was scoped & had all of the typical tests done looking for potential IBD. Thank goodness she tested negative. There is not a specific test for IBS, just the usual testing for IBD. Her dr suggested she keep a food diary & she was able to pinpoint what foods triggered things. Sounds boring but it works. She found dairy to be a huge trigger. You mentioned your gi offering an antidepressant, yes this is often used to treat it. Not sure what your hang up is, but you may want to reconsider. Laxatives are too harsh because they deplete water in the colon. If the colon doesn't have water, then constipation becomes a real problem. Talk to your pharmacist about stool softners, but keep in mind they take several days to work. Another thing you can try is eating a handful of prunes at night, or a cup of warmed prune juice. This is a natural approach. Staying hydrated is a must. I doubt the Methotrexate is your culprit. If anything, folks on it can experience diarrhea. If you can get the constipation under control the bloating will dissipate too. Take care. Moderator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums. Posted 1/21/2019 7:00 PM (GMT -7). Hi Susie,. Thank you for the response. That's a bummer about there being no real test done for IBS. It'd be nice to know what is going on. My inflammation from my IBD is finally going down after nearly 2.5 years of this flare. Finally starting to get over that problem and have this problem enter is less than ideal. Taking a food diary makes sense to me. The reason I've resisted the antidepressants (Nortriptylin) is because I just dont like the idea of continuing to add medications. I feel overloaded as it is taking so much stuff for my IBD plus antidepressants just generally give me the creeps. I know the 10mg is probably a super low dosage so the risks of extreme side effects is low, but I was just hoping there is a more natural way to fix the the symptoms. Might be naive of me to think so. I've thought about cutting back on the dairy products. Ive already eliminated coffee due to my IBD. I also have a probotic although I havent taken it yet. Probotics are talked about a lot for IBS & IBD so I figured I could talk to my doctor about trying it. I also take daily fiber. I guess for me, I'm just generally still confused about IBS and what I'm trying to get under control. The symptoms I understand, but I guess I dont get the reason for the symptoms like I do for IBD. For IBD, I have inflammation that causes a number of symptoms that make sense given the problem. Getting rid of the inflammation gets rid of the problem. For IBS, I just dont quite get what the problem is that's causing the constipation and bloating. Thanks again for your post! Currently Taking: Entyvio, Methotrexate.

I understand where you are coming from about medications. I had uncontrolled explosive diarrhea for 3 very long years. I literally became house bound except for drs appts. I never had warning when it would hit & many, many times in public I never made it to the restroom. The psychological impact was as bad as the issue at hand. I had mal-absorption problems. I became afraid to eat or drink. That lands a person in bad trouble. I was a mess. My gi did everything in his power to help me. I was referred to a dr that wrote the first book on diarrhea, lol. He was of no help. Diet is really a key to helping IBS. Believe me, I am not one of these foodies that think diets are the cure for everything. I had to figure out what to eat or not eat, even though I had slim pickings in the food department. To this day I am careful with what I eat. I also found out if I ate something one week, there was no guarantee I could eat the next week without an issue. It truly is an individual thing. You have to be patient & diligent in finding what works for you. about the antidepressant. There is a connection between the gut & brain. This is why your dr recommended this particular medication. Now a days so many medications are used off label to treat a variety of issues. Try the food diary, if it helps great. If it doesn't perhaps give the medication a serious thought. about the probiotic, there again some folks can take them, others cannot. You will not know until you try. Joined : Aug 2015. Posts : 237. Posted 2/6/2019 9:42 PM (GMT -7). Consider getting tested for celiac disease. Once you have one autoimmune disorder (AI), you can develop more. Celiac disease can cause constipation and bloating as everything can slow down if their is small intestinal damage. I have three autoimmune disorders and that is depressing. I have resisted any medication because I have learned that if I am not flaring, I feel good. Celiac disease can be easily flared by gluten. It is the one AI that the trigger is known. I have learned that a gluten exposure will set off not just my celiac disease, but my other AI issues. But, you and your doctor know best. Can being gluten free help IBD patients? There was a tiny study done at Scripps in San Diego with IBD patients. They achieved a 78% remission rate based on biomarkers having patients follow an AI Paleo diet. Of course a larger study is needed, but no one wants to fund a food study? gov/pmc/articles/PMC5647120/.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4699981416487783503/Discussions---MS-Connection	Discussions - MS Connection	Jan 21, 2019 10:09 PM. That Hug *. Can u describe it? For me, I dont know if its the hug. I dont know if its THE ms hug. Ill describe it. My muscles through out kinda contract. Its not painful, just uncomfortable. It comes in waves. They contract for a few se onds, relax for a few seconds. If I take baclofen, it takes 20+ minutes to stop. If I dont, it continues for hours. Then when it stops on its own, I am sore for a few days. I would imagine its from the constant contracting and relaxing. Mind you, I didnt get a prescription for baclofen until a year ago. The stuff has been great for me. I dont even have an official diagnosis yet either, I went to the neuro today, and he wants an mri. That has been scheduled for May. My bladder has been getting a tad worse. It takes a bit longer to start. My legs still like to give on me. My balance has gotten better. My muscle spasms and cramps have lessened since getting the baclofen. Its not 100%. It still wakes me here and there. I still get numbness and tingling. That seems to have stayed the same. But I am really curious how the ms hug feels for others. I am not even sure what I feel is an ms hug. Jan 26, 2019 7:45 PM. Hi DR2018,. I have yet to be diagnosed, however I have the exact same spasms... I think it is the hug, but I’m not sure. It is strange though. I have a clear MRI, the ‘hug’ happens often. Went to Emergency once DURING the spasms, they continued for 90-minutes. Every nurse saw it, they were all concerned. Dr finally came in, 2-hours later and he said the video i showed him was common and he is not worried. He also told me that the spasms are not an emergency, i should see my Neurologist. Neurologist knows ALL my other symptoms, but because of clear MRI, she has said she can confidently say she RULED OUT MS, and that all my symptoms are due to stress. I am so angry! Am I also having an MS hug? Feb 11, 2019 7:43 PM. I am 'hopeful' ha ha you all get in the habit of laughing. Finding the humor has taken me a lifetime, couldnt think of anything better to do! I am also glad you appreciate the fun of it all. Think funny. 	1	1	Discussions|-|MS|Connection	Jan|21|,|2019|10:09|PM|.|That|Hug|*|.|Can|u|describe|it|?|For|me|,|I|dont|know|if|its|the|hug|.|I|dont|know|if|its|THE|ms|hug|.|Ill|describe|it|.|My|muscles|through|out|kinda|contract|.|Its|not|painful|,|just|uncomfortable|.|It|comes|in|waves|.|They|contract|for|a|few|se|onds|,|relax|for|a|few|seconds|.|If|I|take|baclofen|,|it|takes|20|+|minutes|to|stop|.|If|I|dont|,|it|continues|for|hours|.|Then|when|it|stops|on|its|own|,|I|am|sore|for|a|few|days|.|I|would|imagine|its|from|the|constant|contracting|and|relaxing|.|Mind|you|,|I|didnt|get|a|prescription|for|baclofen|until|a|year|ago|.|The|stuff|has|been|great|for|me|.|I|dont|even|have|an|official|diagnosis|yet|either|,|I|went|to|the|neuro|today|,|and|he|wants|an|mri|.|That|has|been|scheduled|for|May|.|My|bladder|has|been|getting|a|tad|worse|.|It|takes|a|bit|longer|to|start|.|My|legs|still|like|to|give|on|me|.|My|balance|has|gotten|better|.|My|muscle|spasms|and|cramps|have|lessened|since|getting|the|baclofen|.|Its|not|100|%|.|It|still|wakes|me|here|and|there|.|I|still|get|numbness|and|tingling|.|That|seems|to|have|stayed|the|same|.|But|I|am|really|curious|how|the|ms|hug|feels|for|others|.|I|am|not|even|sure|what|I|feel|is|an|ms|hug|.|Jan|26|,|2019|7:45|PM|.|Hi|DR2018|,|.|I|have|yet|to|be|diagnosed|,|however|I|have|the|exact|same|spasms|...|I|think|it|is|the|hug|,|but|I|’|m|not|sure|.|It|is|strange|though|.|I|have|a|clear|MRI|,|the|‘|hug|’|happens|often|.|Went|to|Emergency|once|DURING|the|spasms|,|they|continued|for|90|-|minutes|.|Every|nurse|saw|it|,|they|were|all|concerned|.|Dr|finally|came|in|,|2|-|hours|later|and|he|said|the|video|i|showed|him|was|common|and|he|is|not|worried|.|He|also|told|me|that|the|spasms|are|not|an|emergency|,|i|should|see|my|Neurologist|.|Neurologist|knows|ALL|my|other|symptoms|,|but|because|of|clear|MRI|,|she|has|said|she|can|confidently|say|she|RULED|OUT|MS|,|and|that|all|my|symptoms|are|due|to|stress|.|I|am|so|angry|!|Am|I|also|having|an|MS|hug|?|Feb|11|,|2019|7:43|PM|.|I|am|'|hopeful|'|ha|ha|you|all|get|in|the|habit|of|laughing|.|Finding|the|humor|has|taken|me|a|lifetime|,|couldnt|think|of|anything|better|to|do|!|I|am|also|glad|you|appreciate|the|fun|of|it|all|.|Think|funny|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4699393065808112247/Treating-MS-with-Holistic-Behaviors-and-Strategies:-A-Nutritionists-View	Treating MS with Holistic Behaviors and Strategies: A Nutritionist’s View	When I first met Stephanie in March, she was like any healthy 28-year-old coming in to see me for a nutrition consult. Her positive attitude and bright smile filled the room as she told me about her job as a grade school teacher and the new apartment she just moved into with her boyfriend of seven years. “We are a great team,” she said. “Little did he know that his law school wouldn't be the biggest challenge we'd face as a couple.”. Stephanie was diagnosed about a year ago with multiple sclerosis (MS), and behind her beautiful eyes and strong spirit, I could sense her pain at the discovery of the most recent spinal cord lesions after she complained to her doctors of new nerve pain in her feet. She will be starting steroid infusions in a few weeks, and together we hope to design a nutrition and lifestyle plan that will support her health and healing, and preserve her quality of life. Nerve pain is hard to grasp and relentless in its unpredictability. The nerve damage associated with MS has been linked to causative factors including dysbiosis of the gut microbe, autoimmune responses, and increased inflammation, all leading to an attack on the nervous system by the body's own immune cells. -------.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4699686427621296246/Do-What-You-Can,-when-you-can	Do What You Can, when you can	One of the hardest things I’ve had to accept with MS is the necessity of asking for help. Pride and self-reliance dissipate remarkably quickly when you find yourself splayed on the floor and you no longer have the capacity to get up. In extremis, I then ask for help. But if I’d asked earlier, the whole farrago probably could have been avoided. This lesson took a while to sink in; indeed, I’m not sure I’ve made it out of kindergarten yet! Yes, this disease does infantilize. I can no longer put on my shoes. Each new strategy to do so worked for a while, but eventually, they all failed. I suppose that if I started the day before, I’d have a chance. I’d forget why I was putting them on, but by then the challenge would be enough. I still find it weird as a 61-year-old bloke to watch my 22-year-old son slapping them on in seconds. Hey, I used to beat him at tennis. He was only 8, and I didn’t have MS yet. Give me a break; it was still becoming increasingly difficult! So, yes, I’ve become more receptive of asking for help and not feeling guilty. It’s not any fault of ours, we’re just dealing with the cards that life has dealt. :::::::. T o receive The MS BEACON, e-Newsletter,.

Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant is better than disease-modifying therapies (DMT) at reducing the risk of disease progression in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ), results from the MIST clinical trial show. The study “ Effect of Nonmyeloablative Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation vs Continued Disease-Modifying Therapy on Disease Progression in Patients With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis – A Randomized Clinical Trial ” was published in the journal JAMA . While RRMS patients may respond to immune suppressive therapies, in order to be effective these need to be applied early in the disease course, i.e., while MS is mainly an immune-mediated and inflammatory disease. :::::::.

I remember before taking my medications and being diagnosed I was having excoriating joint pain that would move all around different areas of my body. Once I got diagnosed and got on meds (mezvant and salofalk) it went away. Now 2+ years later UC is not an issue but I am starting to get some new weird sensations. Ever since September my left upper thigh has had a tingling/cold sensation. I have been to Chiro where they think it’s muscle skeletal as I am pretty tight at the hips and lower back. I drive 45 minutes to work and back daily and work at a desk for 6-8 hours, so this could be a decade of this catching up. Despite frequent treatments I have had little relief. The hips get less tight but the tingling remains. Now there are a host of things it could be including just some tightness in that area but has anyone else experience any sensory issues like this? I know MS can cause these sensations sometimes but I have also heard fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, lyme etc.. I have seen a couple GP’s, no extensive tests outside of regular blood work and a quick check of the reflexes/my walking. They didn’t seem overly concerned but the sensation is very real and chronic.

I wonder if some residual joint inflammation in the lower back or pelvis is not pinching a nerve in such a way as to produce the tingling. This woud be swollen tissue, or swollen tissue shifting the joint slightly, pinching the nerve. Inflammation around the body is very common with UC, and this is a less exotic speculation than MS. You might ask about a course of diuretic medication to reduce swollen tissue to see if tingling goes away. You might subsequently see if some short course of steroids (again to reduce inflammation) banishes the tingling. There is some genetic pre-disposition to both autoimmune and more general inflammatory processes with IBD patients. SO something like MS is not out of the question - but it just may be premature to go there. It is also possible some unrelated condition is making some nerve damage. If the tingling is very uncomfortable, maybe have it worked up by someone other than your GI, without evening mentioning the idea it is secondary to IBD. 11/08: ischemic colitis and scope perf colon. 12cm colon/ileocecal resected.

An article was just published the other day in Gastroenterology and Endoscopy News showing an association between an abnormal microbiome and widespread chronic pain. It would not surprise me if they are able to tie many of the inflammatory conditions associated with autoimmune diseases to a lack of certain bacteria in the gut. I experience all of the symptoms you mentioned. Had a bunch of tests, MRI of the brain/spinal cord, blood work etc and nothing was found. I searched several forums and found that this type of thing is very common and usually benign. Do a search of this forum and you will find several threads. Right now I'm experiencing the cold thigh sensation as well as hip and toe pain, burning in the armpits and traveling numbness. I will not be seeing a doctor because I don't think they will have any answers for me... been down that road before. Every doctor had a different theory. I doubt you have MS but see a neurologist if it will put you at ease. Diagnosed Proctosigmoiditis (UC) 2015. Hiatial Hernia w/ GERD.

Posted 1/17/2019 1:33 PM (GMT -7). I am fairly active. I lift weights (squats, bench, lunges, step ups, fully body presses, curls) 3 to 5 times a week. Then I do cardio (basketball/swimming) 3 times a week. I find no limitations while working out in fact I don't even notice it when I am active but as soon as I am done it's back. It's worse when I am sitting at my computer, somewhat better standing and walking but not completely gone and I have found stretching somewhat helps but nothing has been a complete relief since I first started noticing it in September. The other thing is after a nights sleep before I get up and go, while I am still lying in bed I don't feel it. Posted 1/19/2019 9:28 AM (GMT -7).

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. MS & Me in 2019. Thursday January 17 2019 11:02 AM. This New Year, the MS and Me team will bring you more of the things you love as well as a few things you didn’t know you wanted. As we close the third week of 2019, it’s probably time to sweep “Happy New Year” away for another 11½ months. That said, we’d like to take this opportunity to let you know what you might expect from your MS blog this year. First, we wave a grateful goodbye to one of our original blog team, Helen . We wish her all the best as she continues on a career path she was able to take-up again in 2018. Her thoughtful posts, such as the very popular MS & the 2019 Budget , will be missed as much as her positive yet realistic outlook on living with multiple sclerosis. Good luck, Helen! The rest of the MS & Me blog team will look the same for the coming year with some additional guests. The blog itself (as well as the MS Ireland webpage), however, may look different by the end of the year. We are undertaking a long-awaited rework of the website and will take advantage of the opportunity to make the MS & Me blog easier to find, navigate, read and reply. We can’t say exactly when it will happen but, suffice it to say from the prototypes we’ve seen, when it does change, you’ll know! This year we’ve decided to expand on a popular feature we ran a couple of years back. Most months, beginning in February, we will have two bloggers – one man and one woman – co-write a piece on a topic which may have different takes depending on the person with MS’s sex. We’re calling the series “He said – She said”. Topics are set to include such hot buttons as dating, romance, having children after diagnosis, finances and more. We hope you enjoy and engage with our bloggers on these interesting topics viewed from different perspectives. We’re also going to delve into some of the “tough stuff” this year. We all grieve losses in this life. With MS we seem to have to go through some form of the grieving process every time we lose something else to the disease. We’ll have a series of blogs on the stages of grief for you this year as well. We’ll highlight some of the major MS events happening in Ireland and around the world as well as sharing our tips and thoughts of living your best life with this damnable disease along for the ride. The editorial team of MS & Me hope that you’ll enjoy the topics we’ve set out for the year. The cadre of bloggers you’ve come to read hope that you’ll continue to comment, share, and discuss the subjects with your family and friends. Knowledge is, after all, power. And the more of our allies who have the knowledge, the more power we as an MS community will have. Wishing you and your family the best of health.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4698152698192286664/The-Good-Feeling-of-Real-Pain	The ‘Good’ Feeling of Real Pain	There’s a lot of math involved in what I’m about to explain. Well, there could be a lot of math. I’ll try to keep it to a minimum. When a 1 kilogram object (we’ll call it a squeeze bottle of mayonnaise in this case) is knocked from a cupboard shelf (which is, let’s say, about 2 meters high), it falls. The rate of descent reaches 6.26 meters per second, or 22.54 kilometers per hour (just over 14 miles per hour) — that’s 19.6 joules or 14.46 feet per pound — before hitting the floor … or one blogger’s big toe. By the way, that takes all of 0.64 seconds to happen. Without the math, I’m trying to say that 2.2 pounds feels a lot heavier when it strikes your foot from head high … and it hurts like all the expletives ! The Many Varieties of MS-Related Pain. After several days, it still hurts, but there is a bit of comfort in the feeling of pain. Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) can relate to this bit of wonderment with “real” pain, since we experience so many versions of phantom pain (pain for no reason at all) or other sensory disruptions that manifest in what can only be described as pain. There was a time not that long ago when pain was not recognized by clinicians as a symptom of MS. Thankfully, it’s pretty rare to run across a doctor who will not accept this today. If you do run across one of those doctors, run away . We know that there are many types of MS pain , and none of them are pleasant. From sizzling nerve pain to the electric shock of Lhermitte’s sign , from the feeling of icy-cold water droplets falling on you to molten lead dripping, from pins and needles to tens of thousands of beestings … we know pain. RELATED: Treating Chronic Pain in Multiple Sclerosis. The Mysterious Origins of MS Pain. The thing about those feelings of great discomfort compared with the continued throbbing of my hallux (I had no idea that’s what the big toe was called either) is that we cannot say exactly what causes them. Not in ordinary terms, anyway. Nerve pain, phantom pain, pins and needles — there isn’t an injury we can point to and say, “That’s why it hurts.” When a tub of mayo strikes a foot, however, that’s pain with an obvious explanation, and I’ve found some appreciation in it. I am in pain so often because of my MS. Sometimes it’s an annoyance, but more often it alters the course of my day. Without an abrasion or contusion, it’s hard for me to even get my head around it. I know it hurts. I know the theory and science of why I experience the sensation of pain, but it’s sort of like understanding the concept of gravitational waves and space-time yet doing great disservice to physics by trying to explain them. RELATED: When Multiple Sclerosis Causes Skin Symptoms. It’s Nice to Feel Normal, Even When It Hurts. This pain doesn’t need a complex explanation. A heavy thing fell on my foot, and it hurt. It hurt a lot, and it still hurts. There’s some comfort in feeling a real feeling, the way everyone else in the world does. It’s an odd experience, this wonderment at feeling pain, odd but somehow normal. And it’s nice to feel normal once in a while. Wishing you and your family the best of health.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4697150889566975074/The-Tau---CDK5---Signaling-Pathway	The Tau - CDK5 - Signaling Pathway	By Sara Ryding Reviewed by P Surat, Ph.D. CDK5 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family that differs from the other CDK proteins in its function and targets. In Alzheimer’s disease, CDK5 phosphorylates Tau, leading to the accumulation of tau within the axons of nerve cells and eventually, apoptosis. The pathological phosphorylation (yellow) of Tau proteins (red) by CDK5 (violet) leads to the disintegration of microtubuli in an axon and aggregation of tau. (Juan Gaertner |. What are CDK5 and Tau? CDKs are serine/threonine protein kinase proteins typically involved in cell cycle progression in eukaryotic cells. However, CDK5, also called NCLK (neuronal C2CD-like kinase), is involved in neuronal activity, neuronal developmental migration, and growth of neurites. CDK5 is expressed at basal levels in most tissues in mammals, but can also be found in the brain and developing muscle tissue. CDK5 deficiency can lead to the defective formation of the cerebellum, and its activator p35 is critical for normal brain development. CDK5 has a diverse range of substrates, including proteins implicated in cytoskeleton dynamics, cell adhesion, and membrane trafficking. Tau proteins are primarily expressed in mammalian neurons, where they bind microtubules in the axons. They bind to microtubules and promote its assembly, with additional functions in signaling and cytoskeletal organization being recently discovered. Tau activity is regulated by its phosphorylation. Hyperphosphorylation of its aggregates are implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, known as taupathy. How does CDK5 affect Tau? CDK5 phosphorylation of Tau leads to reduced binding to the microtubule. Thus, it cannot promote assembly of the microtubule, leading to decrease in microtubule nucleation. Such alterations in the stability of the microtubule network, driven by CDK5 phosphorylation by other MAPs, affects neuronal migration during development. Tau in the nervous system is activated by binding neuronal activators, p35 and p39. P35 additionally releases p25 which can bind to CDK5 via calpain decomposition. The CDK5/p25 complexes promote Tau phosphorylation due to their strong enzymatic effect and hyperactivation of CDK5 by p25. CDK5 is known to phosphorylate Tau at around 9 to 13 sites, including serine residue 396 and threonine residue 231 in disease states. CDK5/Tau in diseases. Given CDK5’s effect on neuronal tissue, it has been implicated in several neuronal pathologies of Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson’s disease. Tau pathway has been implicated in diseases, such as Alzheimer’s where Tau hyperphosphorylation is one of the main pathology and CDK5 is abnormally activated. CDK5 dysregulation leads to hyperphosphorylation of Tau, which in turn contributes to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. The abnormal phosphorylation of Tau and its accumulation is associated with Alzheimer’s disease. CDK5/Tau induced apoptosis is caused by the build-up of Tau. Tau accumulation disrupts the clearance of ubiquitinated proteins, which leads to accumulation of unfolded proteins inside the ER. This in turn impairs the ERAD pathway, activating the unfolded protein response which leads to apoptosis of neurons. Abnormal phosphorylation by CDK5 in pathological states has been hypothesized to be due to an increase in the rate of phosphorylation at certain sites. There have been indications that phosphorylation of Tau in neurons increases upon exposure to Aβ, hypoxia, oxidative stress, inflammation, and excitotoxicity. Aging has also been suggested to be a stress factor in promoting increased phosphorylation. The CDK5/Tau pathway has been implicated in recreational drugs. Exposure to methamphetamine leads to upregulation of CDK5, leading to increased phosphorylation of Tau. It has been hypothesized that it is through this pathway that methamphetamine causes neuronal apoptosis via Tau accumulation mediated impairment of ERAD. This, along with certain other factors, may underlie the apparent pathological similarities between methamphetamine abusers and neurogenerative disease patients. CDK5 is believed to have an active role in contributing to several disease phenotypes. Thus, research on ways to regulate CDK5 activity are thought to alleviate or remove disease symptoms. Several small molecule CDK5 inhibitors have been found, inhibiting CDK5 by competing with ATP or Tau binding.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4697507930823458993/Discussions---MS-Connection	Discussions - MS Connection	"Jan 13, 2019 4:55 PM. Questions about numbness/tingling and muscle tightness. Hey everyone,. I've already talked with my neurologist about most of these things, so this is more of a ""can anyone relate?"" kind of post. Sometimes I wonder if I overthink things too much ever since my diagnosis of CIS (Clinically Isolated Syndrome) in 2018. But then again, it would make sense of a lot of things. I've been on Copaxone since last November. I do get numbness and tingling. It doesn't last more than a few minutes at a stretch usually, but it will go and come back repeatedly throughout the day. It's usually in my feet or hands, but occasionall other places like legs, back, face, etc. I read an article about paroxymal symptoms which was really interesting and relatable. I also sometimes get pinprick type of sensations in the same areas. I've noticed that it sometimes seems triggered by that body part being cold (especially my feet). Another trigger seems to be things taht would make one's hand/feet ""fall asleep"" but that seems to happen very easily/frequently for me (holding a book, sitting a certain way, etc). I'm wondering how much of this might be the lesions and how much might just be ""normal"" but I experience it daily. I've also been dealing with RLS for quite some time. I finally talked with my doctor about it and she had me try iron since it was slightly low. That hasn't relly helped unfortunately. Sometimes it's just an intense urge to move my legs, sometimes the feel really achy and/or weird. It's often worse around my cycle. I've also noticed recently that I'm tensing up my legs (especially lower legs) unconsiously. When I realise it, I relax them, but it seems as soon as I'm not thinking about it they're tense again. Anyone have similar experiences? Anything, especially non-medicinal, you found helpful for RLS? Jan 13, 2019 8:42 PM. RLS-please SERIOUSLY try to drink more water. Sounds so anti-medical or something you would read on Facebook (believe or not- I’m not on FB). i only give suggestions from experience and/or others experience. this RLS is so simple- it will pass😊✌🏼.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4696443312209461371/Great-results-so-far-on-Tysabri	Great results so far on Tysabri	I was diagnosed Summer of 2017 with RRMS at age 42. I'm a surgeon and stopped operating for a few weeks with arm weakness and other crazy symptoms of my first relapse. Started Plegridy and was feeling better until Spring of 2018. I looked normal and was full time surgeon, but I did back off my normal surgery schedule some. I still struggled some with my self confidence that I needed to see patients and I worried if my MS would stay quiet and allow me to continue to operate. Spring of 2018, I started feeling the fatigue again, then intermittent spasticity on my right side, and then left eye optic neuritis started. It reached a peak on a Monday morning clinic. I was seeing a patient when the spasticity affected my neck muscles and I couldn't talk. The emotions flooded me and I was stuck in spasticity in my office chair. The MRI that week showed progression of brain lesions and 2 new lesions in cervical spine. My neurologist felt with the progression that we should move to new medicine. I'm JCV- and he recommended Tysabri. I missed about a month of work before symptoms improved that I could safely operate again. I've been on Tysabri since August 2018. I have zero side effects. Since October I've felt the best I have since my diagnosis. I now get my infusion on a Friday morning. I leave the infusion office, take off my IV bandaid, and am operating 30 minutes later. Did a follow-up MRI this week. No active and no new lesions on brain. Best news is both cervical lesions are absolutely gone. I have confidence again that I can continue to operate and help people for years to come with my MS diagnosis. Tysabri had been miraculous for me. 	1	1	Great|results|so|far|on|Tysabri	I|was|diagnosed|Summer|of|2017|with|RRMS|at|age|42|.|I'm|a|surgeon|and|stopped|operating|for|a|few|weeks|with|arm|weakness|and|other|crazy|symptoms|of|my|first|relapse|.|Started|Plegridy|and|was|feeling|better|until|Spring|of|2018|.|I|looked|normal|and|was|full|time|surgeon|,|but|I|did|back|off|my|normal|surgery|schedule|some|.|I|still|struggled|some|with|my|self|confidence|that|I|needed|to|see|patients|and|I|worried|if|my|MS|would|stay|quiet|and|allow|me|to|continue|to|operate|.|Spring|of|2018|,|I|started|feeling|the|fatigue|again|,|then|intermittent|spasticity|on|my|right|side|,|and|then|left|eye|optic|neuritis|started|.|It|reached|a|peak|on|a|Monday|morning|clinic|.|I|was|seeing|a|patient|when|the|spasticity|affected|my|neck|muscles|and|I|couldn't|talk|.|The|emotions|flooded|me|and|I|was|stuck|in|spasticity|in|my|office|chair|.|The|MRI|that|week|showed|progression|of|brain|lesions|and|2|new|lesions|in|cervical|spine|.|My|neurologist|felt|with|the|progression|that|we|should|move|to|new|medicine|.|I'm|JCV|-|and|he|recommended|Tysabri|.|I|missed|about|a|month|of|work|before|symptoms|improved|that|I|could|safely|operate|again|.|I've|been|on|Tysabri|since|August|2018|.|I|have|zero|side|effects|.|Since|October|I've|felt|the|best|I|have|since|my|diagnosis|.|I|now|get|my|infusion|on|a|Friday|morning|.|I|leave|the|infusion|office|,|take|off|my|IV|bandaid|,|and|am|operating|30|minutes|later|.|Did|a|follow-up|MRI|this|week|.|No|active|and|no|new|lesions|on|brain|.|Best|news|is|both|cervical|lesions|are|absolutely|gone|.|I|have|confidence|again|that|I|can|continue|to|operate|and|help|people|for|years|to|come|with|my|MS|diagnosis|.|Tysabri|had|been|miraculous|for|me|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695754698256833685/Chemical-synthesis-of-nanotubes	Chemical synthesis of nanotubes	"IMAGE: A nanometer-sized pNT cylinder made of 40 benzenes. The cylinder is tens of thousands of times thinner than a human hair. Credit: (c)2018 Hiroyuki Isobe. For the first time, researchers used benzene - a common hydrocarbon - to create a novel kind of molecular nanotube, which could lead to new nanocarbon-based semiconductor applications. Researchers from the Department of Chemistry have been hard at work in their recently renovated lab in the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Science. The pristine environment and smart layout affords them ample opportunities for exciting experiments. Professor Hiroyuki Isobe and colleagues share an appreciation for ""beautiful"" molecular structures and created something that is not only beautiful but is also a first for chemistry. Their phenine nanotube (pNT) is beautiful to see for its pleasing symmetry and simplicity, which is a stark contrast to its complex means of coming into being. Chemical synthesis of nanotubes is notoriously difficult and challenging, even more so if you wish to delicately control the structures in question to provide unique properties and functions. Typical carbon nanotubes are famous for their perfect graphite structures without defects, but they vary widely in length and diameter. Isobe and his team wanted a single type of nanotube, a novel form with controlled defects within its nanometer-sized cylindrical structure allowing for additional molecules to add properties and functions. The researchers' novel process of synthesis starts with benzene, a hexagonal ring of six carbon atoms. They use reactions to combine six of these benzenes to make a larger hexagonal ring called a cyclo-meta-phenylene (CMP). Platinum atoms are then used which allow four CMPs to form an open-ended cube. When the platinum is removed, the cube springs into a thick circle and this is furnished with bridging molecules on both ends enabling the tube shape. It sounds complicated, but amazingly, this complex process successfully bonds the benzenes in the right way over 90 percent of the time. The key also lies in the symmetry of the molecule, which simplifies the process to assemble as many as 40 benzenes. These benzenes, also called phenines, are used as panels to form the nanometer-sized cylinder. The result is a novel nanotube structure with intentional periodic defects. Theoretical investigations show these defects imbue the nanotube with semiconductor characters. ""A crystal of pNT is also interesting: The pNT molecules are aligned and packed in a lattice rich with pores and voids,"" Isobe explains. ""These nanopores can encapsulate various substances which imbue the pNT crystal with properties useful in electronic applications. One molecule we successfully embedded into pNT was a large carbon molecule called fullerene (C70)."" ""A team lead by Kroto/Curl/Smalley discovered fullerenes in 1985. It is said that Sir Harold Kroto fell in love with the beautiful molecule,"" continues Isobe. ""We feel the same way about pNT. We were shocked to see the molecular structure from crystallographic analysis. A perfect cylindrical structure with fourfold symmetry emerges from our chemical synthesis."" ""After a few decades since the discovery, this beautiful molecule, fullerene, has found various utilities and applications,"" adds Isobe. ""We hope that the beauty of our molecule is also pointing to unique properties and useful functions waiting to be discovered."" Zhe Sun, Koki Ikemoto, Toshiya M.

Lijing Cheng and Kevin Trenberth attended the international World Climate Research Programme conference in September 2016. Credit: Lijing Cheng. Wild fires. Severe storms. Record breaking rains. Heat waves. All occurred in abundance in 2018, and 2018 is shaping up to be the hottest for the oceans as a whole, and therefore for the Earth, in the instrumental record. Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none! On January 11, 2019, an important article in Science magazine asks the question about ""How fast are the oceans warming?"" The subtitle gives the answer: ""Observational records of ocean heat content show that ocean warming is accelerating."" All of these aspects are now very well measured owing to a fairly new ocean observing system called Argo. The network of autonomous profiling floats has now been in place for over 13 years. Also, the quality of older ocean data has been substantially improved, and there are both better and independent methods that account for the sparseness of ocean data before Argo era. Together these advances have enabled quality reconstructions of the past ocean temperature record back to about 1960, enabling the context of the record-breaking recent observations to be properly established. The new article, led by Dr. Lijing Cheng of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, highlights how the new observations along with adjusted older records now clearly show not only how the ocean is warming but that the warming is accelerating. The newly available ocean heat content time series from multiple groups show more consistent but stronger ocean warming since 1960 than previously reported (by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report published in 2013). 2018 is likely to be the hottest year for the oceans on record, beating out 2017 which held the record. 2015 is next warmest, although 2016 was the hottest for the global mean surface temperature, but that was in part because of the huge El Niño event that took place: the extra heat at the surface was at the expense of the ocean which cooled off slightly. By taking up about 93% of the Earth's energy imbalance created by increasing heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere from human activities, the oceans are the main memory of climate change. Moreover, this warming contributes to the rising sea level. It has also contributed to increases in rainfall intensity and stronger, longer-lasting storms, such as Harvey in 2017 and Florence in 2018. In turn declines in ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps, along with declining ocean oxygen levels and destruction of corals reefs accompany the warming ocean. Moreover, the revised and updated ocean heat content record is much more in step with the warming predicted by climate models, thereby providing much more confidence in expectations for the future. The climate models project continuous ocean warming in the 21th century; how much depends on human actions to address climate change. If no actions are taken (""business as usual""), the upper ocean above 2000 meters will warm by 2020 ZetaJoules by 2081-2100, which is about 6 times larger than the total ocean warming during the past 60 years. If the target of the Paris Agreement can be reached, the total ocean warming could be cut in half by 2081-2100 (about 1037 ZetaJoules). The fairly steady rise in ocean heat content clearly shows that the planet is warming. Ocean heat content is not bothered much by weather fluctuations that do, however, affect the surface temperatures, and it is somewhat affected by El Niño events. With consequences in the tens of billions of dollars per year, and prospects for further increases in ocean heat content and sea level rise, the case for much more urgency in addressing the causes of global warming is abundantly clear.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4696088515276231521/MS-Ireland--::-Helping-Everyone-Affected-by-Multiple-Sclerosis	MS Ireland  :: Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis	"MS Ireland  ::. Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Thursday January 10 2019 12:45 PM. At the start of New Year 2019, Declan Groeger shares with us his plans for the year ahead. Read on for a plan of action we can all adapt to our own resolutions. 2019 is a new year; a year full of hopes and fears, a year full of aspirations and dreams and a year full of good intentions. But it is also a year that, without proper planning, will be filled with disappointments. John Heywood, an English playwright better known for phrases that are embedded in our psyche, is credited with the saying “Rome wasn’t built in a day” . This was modernised to the phrase “softly-softly-catchy-monkey” by Queen Victoria. Loosely translated, both these phrases mean that patience is important. The essential ingredients for success are realism, focus, planning and patience; each ingredient being of equal importance. Another trite adage alerts us to the importance of planning “By failing to prepare you are preparing to fail”, Benjamin Franklin. Realism is important for everyone but even more so for people living with Multiple Sclerosis; we must acknowledge our limitations and plan accordingly. To my way of thinking there is no point in targeting a climb to the summit of Mount Everest without setting a schedule of lesser achievements and waypoints on the journey. Focus is equally important. I find that maintaining focus for a long-term project can be difficult and to that end, I recommend the ‘buddy system’. Confide in someone; share your resolution and accept help and encouragement from your confidante. Write it down; having a goal in writing somehow makes it more real. Planning is essential and this ingredient incorporates patience. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry once said, ""A goal without a plan is just a wish"". Some goals seem much more difficult without intermediate targets and for me the inclusion of these waypoints make the challenge seem less onerous and more achievable; softly softly catchy monkey! A word of warning- planning should not be used as an excuse to procrastinate. Planning is essential but procrastination is the death knell for many good intentions. I’m only making one New Year resolution this year. In past years I would make a list and start off the New Year with the best of intentions and ultimately most, if not all, fell by the wayside. Time has passed and now more than 30 years after my diagnosis I have learned to be more realistic. I make one resolution and try to do it well. Attempting to do too much is foolish and this is true in any walk of life. Do less but do it well. My New Year resolution is to be kinder to myself. Why that one you might ask? The answer is simple; I haven’t been very kind to me and I need to be. What New Year Resolution have you adopted for 2019?

Companies want so much for nothing. Add message |. ALittleCrisp Wed 09-Jan-19 12:39:11. Just seen two job adverts saying ""Advanced Microsoft package skills is an absolute must"". The pay? £7.80 and £7.85 an hour. This country really has a problem. ShatnersWig Wed 09-Jan-19 12:40:51. Post the adverts, I'd like to see what the jobs actually entail, the hours, what sort of company before making a legitimate comment. wowfudge Wed 09-Jan-19 12:41:09. It's far easier to find your way around MS Office these days. They probably mean the person you'll be working for doesn't have a clue and can't type. Exexexcel Wed 09-Jan-19 12:44:11. If kids came out of primary school without Ms office skills there'd be something wrong. I don't think it's unreasonable. The issue will be the interpretation of advanced. E.g. in excel are we talking macros? Or just pivots? Or not even that. Completely depends on the job. ReflectentMonatomism Wed 09-Jan-19 12:44:29. In 2019 being able to use a computer reasonably competently is like asking for basic literacy and the ability to add up was 30 years ago. CastleCrasher Wed 09-Jan-19 12:44:51. Isn't minimum wage £7.83? greendale17 Wed 09-Jan-19 12:45:48. How much do you think they should for a package practically the entire country knows how to use? ALittleCrisp Wed 09-Jan-19 12:46:52. I'm not saying they should be paying mega bucks. But they specifically say ""Advanced Microsoft package skills"" Bit different to simple skills on Word and Excel. Bombardier25966 Wed 09-Jan-19 12:47:07. It depends on what they mean by advanced skills. It's a vague term, and I'd guess they don't mean it in its true sense but more someone that knows their way around Office. peachypetite Wed 09-Jan-19 12:47:24. Being able to use Microsoft packages is a daily part of most office jobs to be fair. ALittleCrisp Wed 09-Jan-19 12:48:42. Again, yes Microsoft is part of lost office jobs. But surely someone else can see why ""Advanced Microsoft package skills"" sounds totally unreasonable for £7.85 an hour? ALoadOfCodswallop Wed 09-Jan-19 12:50:11. I'm not sure I see the problem here. Being able to use MS office software for entry level positions is a must these days. Ellisandra Wed 09-Jan-19 12:50:46. Computer literacy is a basic. Advanced is a vague term. Can mean the difference between able to open and look at someone else’s excel file, and able to add your own formulas. starabara Wed 09-Jan-19 12:51:34. Depends what you mean by advanced.... I don’t think it sounds unnecessarily low? HollyBollyBooBoo Wed 09-Jan-19 12:52:27. Perfectly reasonable request, just asking for a specific skill. ALittleCrisp Wed 09-Jan-19 12:52:52. Well yes, it is. But ""Microsoft package skills at an Advanced level"" isn't really entry level. I'm not really 'Advanced' on some Microsoft applications, but I'm paid over 30k a year for it. That's why I'm saying ""Advanced Microsoft package skills"" for less than 8 quid an hour sounds a bit bonkers. megletthesecond Wed 09-Jan-19 12:56:19. Basic excel, word and PowerPoint would be ok. Avanced at that salary is taking the piss. Bombardier25966 Wed 09-Jan-19 12:56:29. For everyone saying it's perfectly reasonable, how are your skills in Silverlight? Do you even know what Silverlight is? Microsoft packages cover far more than Office! Dinosforall Wed 09-Jan-19 12:56:42. But your interpretation of 'advanced' and those of the person writing the ad/the likely pool of candidates might be completely different. Jazzybeats Wed 09-Jan-19 12:56:45. Advanced excel is actually a really specialist skill. Creating macros, querying databases, potentially linking to other programmes and datasets using SQL, Pythion.... If that’s what they mean, YANBU. daisypond Wed 09-Jan-19 12:57:08. I don't know what macros or pivots are (as part of a Microsoft package). That sounds ""advanced"" to me. bibbitybobbityyhat Wed 09-Jan-19 12:58:23. Yanbu op. Working people, young, old, experienced, inexperienced are simply not paid enough in this country! Look at the sickening gap in incomes between CEOs and their workforce and the astonishing rate at which this has widened in the last 20 or so years . Wages in ""ordinary"" jobs have absolutely stalled. babysharkah Wed 09-Jan-19 13:02:40. Advanced office skills aren't complex. If you don't know them you can learn them very quickly with MS help and google. Sparklfairy Wed 09-Jan-19 13:03:26. 'Advanced' is so vague. If theyd followed that sentence with specific examples then they would probably get more quality applicants. As it stands (judging by the responses here) people will either be scared off by the term or blindly apply without necessarily having the skills needed for the role. Justaboy Wed 09-Jan-19 13:03:49.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694908215723702489/Screening-donated-blood-for-Zika-not-cost-effective	Screening donated blood for Zika not cost-effective	1. Screening all donated blood for Zika virus is not cost-effective in the United States. Abstract: http://annals. org/ aim/ article/ doi/ 10. 7326/ M18-2238. Editorial: http://annals. 7326/ M18-3527. URLs go live when the embargo lifts. Universal screening of individual blood donations for Zika virus, which began in 2016, was not cost-effective in the 50 states during the first year. Widespread screening would only be cost-effective in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico and never in the 50 states. Findings from a microsimulation study are published in Annals of Internal Medicine . The Zika epidemic of the Americas beginning in 2015 is the largest outbreak to date. Because Zika virus is associated with severe illness, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, and potentially devastating birth defects, such as microcephaly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented measures to protect transfusion recipients from infection. In 2016, the FDA began requiring universal individual donation nucleic acid testing (ID-NAT) of donated blood for Zika virus in U.S. states and territories. Universal screening is still required today, although mini-pool NAT (MP-NAT) is permitted as of July 2018. However, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these measures had not been evaluated previously. Researchers from Stanford University, Vitalant Research Institute, and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT, universal mini-pool NAT, and alternative Zika virus screening policies in Puerto Rico and the 50 states. The microsimulation captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients, sexual partners, and their infants to weight the cost/benefit of universal screening. They found that during the first year of testing, screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico, and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states. Because the Zika epidemic is largely over, screening policies are much less cost-effective today than during the period of their analysis. These findings suggest that revisiting the universal blood screening policy would be warranted. However, the authors note that many other considerations should inform blood safety policies in addition to cost-effectiveness.

Students deliberately infected by parasite shed light on cause of Katayama syndrome. 7326/ L18-0438. Katayama syndrome can occur in the absence of parasite eggs, suggesting that newly expressed antigens on developing worms may be the cause of illness. Understanding the cause of this syndrome can aid in identifying an appropriate treatment. A brief case report of students deliberately infected by schistosoma larvae is published in Annals of Internal Medicine . Katayama syndrome is a self-limited illness that occurs several weeks after infection with Schistosoma larvae. Symptoms may become severe or lead to chronic illness, so it is important to understand the root cause. Two human participants were infected with male cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni by researchers from Leiden University Medical Center. Only male parasitic worms were used so that they could not produce eggs in their hosts. Both participants developed Katayama syndrome, as evidenced by typical illnesses at the expected time after exposure, even in the absence of eggs. Based on an observation of the two participants, the researchers concluded that Katayama syndrome can present with remarkable heterogeneity in clinical signs and symptoms and may be nonspecific enough to make diagnosis difficult. According to the authors, the cases show that eosinophillia and seroconversion may become apparent after severe symptoms have subsided, that Katayama syndrome can be diagnosed as early as 5 weeks after exposure, and that it is not necessarily related to egg deposition.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695027733542609969/The-Difficulty-and-Honor-of-Hearing-From-Those-Newly-Diagnosed-With-MS	The Difficulty and Honor of Hearing From Those Newly Diagnosed With MS	I received far, far too many messages in 2018 from my family, friends, friends of friends, and even people I’ve never met. The senders are always concerned, often bewildered, and sometimes quite worried. They ask for guidance; they seek advice; they long for credible resources. What they hope for more than anything is honesty … but they also hope for answers I cannot provide. These, of course, are people who get in touch because someone they know has recently been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) . I am honored that people reach out to me when looking for answers. It means — to me at least — that I am somehow meeting my goals of making the experiences and the information I share relatable and understandable to the broader MS audience. But I’m saddened at the number of newly diagnosed members who continue to be added to our club's roster. RELATED: New CDC Registry to Monitor MS Prevalence and Disease Trends. So Many People Are Unaware of the Resources Available to Them. I am overwhelmed by the number of people who want to help in any way they can but who are unaware of the resources available to them as people who care about someone with MS. These organizations, like so many others, aren’t just for people living with MS. They can help those who want to help those with the disease, too. Here’s but a partial list:. RELATED: MS Resources. An MS Diagnosis Affects You and Those Around You. When I’m approached about a particular MS symptom or coping strategy, I’m almost always able to offer up an article or two on the subject. This year, I will enter my 14th year of writing about living with multiple sclerosis. In that time, I've amassed quite a library of MS-related topics (just google “Trevis Gleason” and your MS topic of interest). But people are looking for more than a simple blog post or article. As many people with MS know, those first months after diagnosis are harrowing. What we may not know is that there are people who surround us — family, friends, coworkers, neighbors, teachers — who are having a difficult time with it in their own way. They need to know and understand some of the same things that the person with MS does. Namely that things will be all right. They won’t be the same; they’ll be different even if they don’t feel different. RELATED: The Wide-Ranging Impact of Multiple Sclerosis on My Social Circle. How to Help When Each Person’s MS Experience Is Different. Also, it’s important to know, particularly for those of us who get those calls and emails, that everyone’s journey with MS is different — just as each person is different. How I have found my way might not be the path for everyone. How one person with MS has done, taken, or experienced any one thing to make their life with multiple sclerosis a little bit better isn’t all that relevant. What’s better, I think, is for the lot of us to drop bread crumbs along our journey and leave a general direction that others may choose to follow. No one person’s path can be trod by another. The more crumbs on any particular topic, however, and a person new to our community can see generalities that have worked for many. RELATED: 10 Tips for People Newly Diagnosed With Multiple Sclerosis. I will continue to get those messages in 2019. Many readers of this column will as well. It’s important that we each offer what support we can at that moment. What is equally important is to steer those with MS or those who are concerned for someone with MS to communities who have helped us find our way as well. None of us got here alone, and no one should have to go it alone — in giving advice as well as living with a new diagnosis. Wishing you and your family the best of health.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. World MS Day 2019. Tuesday January 15 2019 11:15 AM. Raising awareness of the invisible symptoms and unseen impact of MS. World MS Day 2019 will take place on 30th May. The 2019 campaign will be called ‘My Invisible MS’ (#MyInvisibleMS) and the theme is Visibility. My Invisible MS will raise awareness of the invisible symptoms of MS and the unseen impact of MS on quality of life. The campaign will give a voice to everyone affected by MS to share their invisible MS symptoms and express what you want others to know and understand about MS, in order to challenge common misconceptions and help people understand how to provide the right support. There are many ways to get involved in World MS Day and use and adapt the My Invisible MS campaign. You can take part in the campaign online and on social media, hold an event to bring people together for World MS Day, lobby your decision makers to make positive changes for people affected by MS…there are so many possibilities!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694670591921713153/Discussions---MS-Connection	Discussions - MS Connection	"Jan 06, 2019 1:55 AM. Vision Loss and MS*. Jan 06, 2019 4:43 PM. Hi Maria, I haven’t been given any solution for my eyes from doctors. Glasses don’t help. the issue. It’s quite frusfrating. For my MS overall, I’ve begun eating healthier and am on Copaxone. I do struggle with tons of stress at my new job.. I know this can’t be good for my symptoms. Jan 06, 2019 5:04 PM. How we handle stress and frustration makes a significant difference in the progress of ms. Making the best of a bad situation is relevant. Making muscles tense all the time puts a burden on the body. It is up to you to find way that keep your body comfortable and your mind quiet. I stopped all disease modifying drugs and related ms prescriptions about three years ago. After being on betaseron for more than twenty five years I am at the stage where it does not help anymore and I have moved on to spms. So what, big deal, at almost 72 things are getting old, parts are slowing and life is moving in one direction, again so what, keeping myself with soft muscles, no matter what, and a quiet mind has the doctors impressed with my eyes, almost not noticing the neuritis, I can still walk, though like every part of ms, sometimes everything gives me trouble. I am having problems using my hands and arms and hemp oil and hemp cream have made dramatic relief as well as Vitamins and suppliments, even my strength has improved. Try googling the problem you have and see what homeopathic solutions are available. Ayurvedic medicine is a healthy choice for improving everything. Also know that most issues with ms are fleeting and do go away given time. Staying in the moment aids in seeing right now and not all the way down the road. New solutions appear all the time and wisdom is earned with age so being kind to yourself is a good rule, do everything you can to take really good care of yourself, be selfish about your well being and do your best to avoid regret, make your choices based upon whether or not you will regret it tomorrow, because regret is the best enemy of a better life with ms alongside stress and anxiety. Jan 06, 2019 8:41 PM. I appreciate your advice so much, Maria! I’m so glad you mentioned alternative ways to take care of your body. If you don’t mind me asking, did the doctors ever give you solutions for your neuritis, or did you just find the alternatives that worked without their help? I’m curious to know how doctors have dealt with other patients suffering from optic neuritis. I’ve seriously considered finding alternatives but all I’ve been told is that MS prescription drugs (namely, Copaxone) is the best way to go. Part of me believes there’s more I can and should do. I will definitely make a more conscious effort to relax and reduce my stress. I will especially be kinder to myself! I feel we need more of that period :). Jan 06, 2019 9:42 PM. I have always been put on steroids as pills or infusions, but at the same times I have been sooooo ill it was necessary to try to control the exacerbations. It took many years for my eyes to clear up. But I credit talking to my brain for part of it. I am a strong believer that the brain takes orders and does what we tell it to do. Both silently and out loud I ask my brain to 'fix it' and trust that it will, even though it may take some time. Brain fix my eyes. Of course some ailments leave so much damage it will take longer or may be impossible to repair. My brain doesnt listen or is unable when I ask it to lose weight, giggle. There are many posts about supplements people take.B1 zinc omega 3s are helpful for eyes. Jan 07, 2019 12:40 AM. Steroids definitely tore my body apart! I was placed on an IV with steroids for 2 hours each day during the first week after being diagnosed. Worst week by far! Couldn’t eat anything and broke out all over my body. I threw up pure liquid during the last days because my stomach was empty. I will definitely look into more information about supplements! I’ve been in a state of denial for the last 3 years but am finally ready to start helping myself. We’ll see how talking to my brain works. I’ll still give it a shot and sneak in the “lose weight” command because i definitely need to try after all this holiday food Hahahaha. you have been aich an amazing help,. I wish I would have been open to this sooner.. but it’s never too late to start making positive changes! Jan 07, 2019 12:55 AM. Thank you for sharing! I hadn’t heard of nystagmus before.. it must have been frightening to experience those symptoms for the first time! I also stopped driving because of my symptoms, but this was a personal choice. Although the last ophthalmologist told me they’d need to report that I’m not able to drive because of how poorly I performed on the vision exams. How was the transition for you when you stopped driving? Has it been difficult for you to explain your reason for not driving to others? Having to give up driving and sell my car has been one of the most difficult parts of my journey. Thankfully my husband is able and willing to drive me to and from work every day so I’m still very blessed :) Lyft/Uber can get expensive lol. Jan 07, 2019 8:12 AM. You may want to search for an MS specialist or a neuroopthamologist if you are not already seeing one. You can also read more about vision issues in our online brochure: Vision Problems. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call and speak to an MS Navigator at 1-800-344-4867, Monday through Friday. Warm Regards,. Jan 07, 2019 2:14 PM. Omg yes! Intravenous steroids messed me up too. It also made me nauseous and I couldn’t eat or stand the smell food. Are the steroids the only treatment you’ve received for your eye? Have the doctors given you an official diagnosis for the loss of vision (like optic neuritis in my case)? I hope it all goes well with your ophthalmologist appointment! Jan 08, 2019 5:42 AM. Are any of you also struggling with vision problems? When I was 27 I was blind as a bat for about a week. After that I had ON that would put puffy white-ish ""clouds"" into my field of vision if I was too hot. Unless I cooled down I would temporarily lose vision again. Fortunately, those issues disappeared after a couple of years. But with that said, in an attack/flare-up recently (decades later) I've had some more ON issues but not the white clouds (more of loss of stereo focus and blurriness). However, those seem to be declining in frequency and hopefully going away. Having read about you, two thoughts come to mind (more advice -- just what you need, right?!:). A few years ago I followed Terri Wahls' diet for over a year, a diet that calls for eating a profuse amounts of greens and veggies. At that time my vision was declining a bit, but pretty much like it does for lots of people in their late-40s/early-50s. But while on that diet my distance vision improved to better than 20/20. Today I'm a firm believer in eating greens and veggies. The other part is stress. There are lots of people that make links between MS issues and stress. Since your livelihood depends on it it's a tough issue, but if your job is a source of stress you might want to think about how you can reduce and deal with that issue. Jan 09, 2019 10:12 PM. Golgotha—yes, I’m soaking in alllll the advice i can get! It definitely feels much better to receive advice from people like you, who understand the personal struggle with MS! I’ve received more than enough advice from people who claim to “get it” when they don’t even struggle with the disability -_-. you know what, I think I will give more veggies a try!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694724168634464434/Can-Biotin-help-treat-MS?	Can Biotin help treat MS?	Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system, including the brain and the spinal cord. Some studies suggest that a vital B-vitamin, biotin, might help reduce the impact of the disease. By Danielle Dresden - December 2018. Reviewed by Zara Risoldi Cochrane, PharmD, MS, FASCP. Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) use diet to help manage their symptoms. Many foods contain biotin , including brewer's yeast, nuts, egg yolks, Swiss chard, liver, and many others. One important group of vitamins are the B-vitamins, which help the body turn food into energy, support the nervous system, and maintain the skin, hair, eyes, and liver. They are vital during pregnancy. People sometimes refer to biotin as vitamin B-7 or vitamin H. It is one of the B-complex vitamins and is essential for human health. The United States Food and Nutrition Board has not set a recommended daily allowance (RDA) for biotin, but the board has established an adequate intake (AI) level of 30 micrograms (mcg) per day for adults. In this article, we look at the possible benefits of biotin in the treatment of MS. Amongst other foods, biotin can be found in nuts. Biotin is thought to help manage presentations of progressive MS due to supporting nerve cell metabolism. MS develops when the immune system targets and damages myelin, a substance that covers and protects the nerve cells. Biotin activates key enzymes, helping the body to produce more myelin. Enzymes are proteins that carry out crucial functions in the body. Healthy levels of myelin allow nerve cells to communicate with each other more efficiently. This communication between the nerve cells may reduce the level of disability in people with MS. Producing more myelin may also slow the progression of the disease. :::::::. 	1	0	Can|Biotin|help|treat|MS|?

The presence of certain levels of a molecule called acrolein in the human body could be an early warning sign for the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS), researchers say. Photo: iStock. New Delhi: The presence of certain levels of a molecule called acrolein in the human body could be an early warning sign for the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS), the incurable and often debilitating disease, researchers say. Researchers at Purdue University and the Indiana University School of Medicine in the US found that the molecule, previously suspected as a metabolic waste product that accumulates in people with certain neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease, could possibly be used to help diagnose MS. Acrolein is a byproduct of fat metabolism. A potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord, MS usually is diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, and affects twice as many women as men. Although there is no cure for MS, recent years have seen a flurry of activity around possible bio-markers and treatments. “We are in the process of trying to correlate acrolein levels with MS disease activity, which potentially would help us monitor disease activity with a blood test,” David Mattson, professor of neurology, and the director of the Indiana University Multiple Sclerosis Centre, said. “If this is validated, it would help us decide how aggressive to be with immunotherapy, or whether a therapy is working or there is a need to switch to a different therapy.”. Riyi Shi, a professor of neuroscience and biomedical engineering in Purdue University’s Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, has found that an accumulation of the molecule is present in animal models of neurological diseases such as MS, Parkinson’s disease, or even spinal cord and brain injuries. Acrolein is thought to damage cells by disrupting the lipids, or fats that protect nerve tissue, in a process called lipid peroxidation. Shi said that both blood and urine tests and assays have been able to measure acrolein levels in humans and in animal models. “The levels of this compound in urine and blood are correlated—the MS patients that had the highest level of acrolein in the blood also had the highest level in the urine,” he said. According to Shi, it is, therefore, possible that high level of acrolein is indicative of more active MS, although low levels do not rule out the possibility of someone having MS. Further research is needed to validate these initial observations. The research has suggested that acrolein is not just a potential bio-marker of MS, but could also be a target for therapies. “There are drugs already in the market that are known to be acrolein scavengers, and it is possible that one of these drugs could be re-purposed as a possible therapy for MS,” Shi said. “But these drugs also have strong effects on other targets, so more study would need to be done to see if they have a therapeutic effect to eliminate acrolein at a safe level.” According to the atlas of multiple sclerosis, there are about 2.3 million people in the world who suffer from the disease. It is estimated that the total burden in India is close to 180,000. :::::::. 	1	0	MS|Views|and|News|:	December|27|,|2018|.|The|presence|of|certain|levels|of|a|molecule|called|acrolein|in|the|human|body|could|be|an|early|warning|sign|for|the|onset|of|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|,|researchers|say|.|Photo|:|iStock|.|New|Delhi|:|The|presence|of|certain|levels|of|a|molecule|called|acrolein|in|the|human|body|could|be|an|early|warning|sign|for|the|onset|of|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|,|the|incurable|and|often|debilitating|disease|,|researchers|say|.|Researchers|at|Purdue|University|and|the|Indiana|University|School|of|Medicine|in|the|US|found|that|the|molecule|,|previously|suspected|as|a|metabolic|waste|product|that|accumulates|in|people|with|certain|neurological|disorders|,|such|as|multiple|sclerosis|and|Parkinson|’|s|disease|,|could|possibly|be|used|to|help|diagnose|MS|.|Acrolein|is|a|byproduct|of|fat|metabolism|.|A|potentially|disabling|disease|of|the|brain|and|spinal|cord|,|MS|usually|is|diagnosed|between|the|ages|of|20|and|50|,|and|affects|twice|as|many|women|as|men|.|Although|there|is|no|cure|for|MS|,|recent|years|have|seen|a|flurry|of|activity|around|possible|bio-markers|and|treatments|.|“|We|are|in|the|process|of|trying|to|correlate|acrolein|levels|with|MS|disease|activity|,|which|potentially|would|help|us|monitor|disease|activity|with|a|blood|test|,|”|David|Mattson|,|professor|of|neurology|,|and|the|director|of|the|Indiana|University|Multiple|Sclerosis|Centre|,|said|.|“|If|this|is|validated|,|it|would|help|us|decide|how|aggressive|to|be|with|immunotherapy|,|or|whether|a|therapy|is|working|or|there|is|a|need|to|switch|to|a|different|therapy|.|”|.|Riyi|Shi|,|a|professor|of|neuroscience|and|biomedical|engineering|in|Purdue|University|’|s|Department|of|Basic|Medical|Sciences|,|College|of|Veterinary|Medicine|and|Weldon|School|of|Biomedical|Engineering|,|has|found|that|an|accumulation|of|the|molecule|is|present|in|animal|models|of|neurological|diseases|such|as|MS|,|Parkinson|’|s|disease|,|or|even|spinal|cord|and|brain|injuries|.|Acrolein|is|thought|to|damage|cells|by|disrupting|the|lipids|,|or|fats|that|protect|nerve|tissue|,|in|a|process|called|lipid|peroxidation|.|Shi|said|that|both|blood|and|urine|tests|and|assays|have|been|able|to|measure|acrolein|levels|in|humans|and|in|animal|models|.|“|The|levels|of|this|compound|in|urine|and|blood|are|correlated|—|the|MS|patients|that|had|the|highest|level|of|acrolein|in|the|blood|also|had|the|highest|level|in|the|urine|,|”|he|said|.|According|to|Shi|,|it|is|,|therefore|,|possible|that|high|level|of|acrolein|is|indicative|of|more|active|MS|,|although|low|levels|do|not|rule|out|the|possibility|of|someone|having|MS|.|Further|research|is|needed|to|validate|these|initial|observations|.|The|research|has|suggested|that|acrolein|is|not|just|a|potential|bio-marker|of|MS|,|but|could|also|be|a|target|for|therapies|.|“|There|are|drugs|already|in|the|market|that|are|known|to|be|acrolein|scavengers|,|and|it|is|possible|that|one|of|these|drugs|could|be|re-purposed|as|a|possible|therapy|for|MS|,|”|Shi|said|.|“|But|these|drugs|also|have|strong|effects|on|other|targets|,|so|more|study|would|need|to|be|done|to|see|if|they|have|a|therapeutic|effect|to|eliminate|acrolein|at|a|safe|level|.|”|According|to|the|atlas|of|multiple|sclerosis|,|there|are|about|2.3|million|people|in|the|world|who|suffer|from|the|disease|.|It|is|estimated|that|the|total|burden|in|India|is|close|to|180,000|.|::|:|.

By Mona Sen. Accepting the changes that come with secondary-progressive MS is necessary to live well in this new place. The year was 2012 when I transitioned from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). At the time, however, I didn’t really know that I had entered a new phase of multiple sclerosis (MS) . In retrospect, yes, things were changing and had changed. But my MS moves like a slow train, and so the situation seemed manageable, though really it was not. I needed to realize that this new place was an entirely different environment from what I was used to. Sure, disability existed, and me within it, but now the disability and I were almost one and the same. Denial Is Not Always a Bad Thing. The way I see it, RRMS technically lasted from my diagnosis in 1986 until 2012. So the 26 formative years in between consisted of living life with the hope that things might never get bad. But they did: I followed the textbook on MS, meeting the milestones the experts said I would. Denial, as most of us know, is not always a negative thing, since I did live successfully during that time, trying to forget the entity within me. I just remember noticing odd symptoms and using a single cane to identify myself as a person with a disability. But that was then, and it was as though I was playing a part in a movie. I don’t recall feeling too much fear; it was just that I felt “different” and not quite myself. I talk about this in my memoir , because all I could do was write down my innermost feelings. Now, the next step is here, and I couldn’t really prepare for it. At Last: A Focus on People With Secondary-Progressive MS. Yesterday I realized why my neurologist likes seeing me twice a year. I’m sure he cares about how I’m managing, but since he is a clinician, one of his main aims is to watch for drastic changes in my symptoms or functioning, such as changes in my walking ability or use of adaptive equipment. Seeing my neurologist is almost a formality more than anything. He exists to cater to my changing needs since he cannot make bad symptoms go away. :::::::. 	1	0	MS|Views|and|News|:	Personal|Takes|.|Compared|with|life|with|relapsing-remitting|MS|,|SPMS|feels|like|an|entirely|different|environment|.|By|Mona|Sen|.|Accepting|the|changes|that|come|with|secondary-progressive|MS|is|necessary|to|live|well|in|this|new|place|.|The|year|was|2012|when|I|transitioned|from|relapsing-remitting|multiple|sclerosis|(|RRMS|)|to|secondary-progressive|multiple|sclerosis|(|SPMS|)|.|At|the|time|,|however|,|I|didn|’|t|really|know|that|I|had|entered|a|new|phase|of|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|.|In|retrospect|,|yes|,|things|were|changing|and|had|changed|.|But|my|MS|moves|like|a|slow|train|,|and|so|the|situation|seemed|manageable|,|though|really|it|was|not|.|I|needed|to|realize|that|this|new|place|was|an|entirely|different|environment|from|what|I|was|used|to|.|Sure|,|disability|existed|,|and|me|within|it|,|but|now|the|disability|and|I|were|almost|one|and|the|same|.|Denial|Is|Not|Always|a|Bad|Thing|.|The|way|I|see|it|,|RRMS|technically|lasted|from|my|diagnosis|in|1986|until|2012|.|So|the|26|formative|years|in|between|consisted|of|living|life|with|the|hope|that|things|might|never|get|bad|.|But|they|did|:|I|followed|the|textbook|on|MS|,|meeting|the|milestones|the|experts|said|I|would|.|Denial|,|as|most|of|us|know|,|is|not|always|a|negative|thing|,|since|I|did|live|successfully|during|that|time|,|trying|to|forget|the|entity|within|me|.|I|just|remember|noticing|odd|symptoms|and|using|a|single|cane|to|identify|myself|as|a|person|with|a|disability|.|But|that|was|then|,|and|it|was|as|though|I|was|playing|a|part|in|a|movie|.|I|don|’|t|recall|feeling|too|much|fear|;|it|was|just|that|I|felt|“|different|”|and|not|quite|myself|.|I|talk|about|this|in|my|memoir|,|because|all|I|could|do|was|write|down|my|innermost|feelings|.|Now|,|the|next|step|is|here|,|and|I|couldn|’|t|really|prepare|for|it|.|At|Last|:|A|Focus|on|People|With|Secondary-Progressive|MS|.|Yesterday|I|realized|why|my|neurologist|likes|seeing|me|twice|a|year|.|I|’|m|sure|he|cares|about|how|I|’|m|managing|,|but|since|he|is|a|clinician|,|one|of|his|main|aims|is|to|watch|for|drastic|changes|in|my|symptoms|or|functioning|,|such|as|changes|in|my|walking|ability|or|use|of|adaptive|equipment|.|Seeing|my|neurologist|is|almost|a|formality|more|than|anything|.|He|exists|to|cater|to|my|changing|needs|since|he|cannot|make|bad|symptoms|go|away|.|::|:|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693238880543272520/Paul-Whelan:-Strange-tale-of-the-American-accused-of-spying-in-Russia	Paul Whelan: Strange tale of the American accused of spying in Russia	"Mysterious tale of Paul Whelan, American man accused of spying in Russia, steeped in contradictions. Kristen Jordan Shamus Detroit Free Press. Published 9:08 AM EST Jan 3, 2019. He traveled the world for business and for pleasure; that much is known about Paul N. Whelan, the Novi man the Russian government alleges was spying in Moscow when it arrested him Friday. The Russian Federal Security Service, known as the FSB, said Whelan, 48, was detained ""while on a spy mission"" and notified the State Department on Monday that it was holding him. He is being held in the Lefortovo Detention Facility in Moscow. The FSB offered no other details. If he's convicted of espionage, Whelan could face up to 20 years in prison. So how does an ex-Marine, who is allegedly visiting Russia to help a friend, get picked up as a spy? It's a case that has birthed countless theories and speculation not only about Paul Whelan, but also about America's complex relationship with Russia. Government response to Whelan's case has been less-than-swift, and measured. U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, visited Whelan on Wednesday at the Russian prison. He expressed support for Whelan and offered the help of the U.S. Embassy, a State Department spokesperson said. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that ""if the detention is not appropriate, we will demand his immediate return."" This undated photo provided by the Whelan family shows Paul Whelan in Iceland. Whelan, a former U.S. Marine arrested in Russia on espionage charges, was visiting Moscow over the holidays to attend a wedding when he suddenly disappeared, his brother said Tuesday, Jan. 1, 2019. Courtesy of the Whelan Family via AP. Wrong place, wrong time? Whelan's travels brought him to Russia multiple times, said his brother, David Whelan, explaining that Paul Whelan is an ex-Marine who previously worked in global security for Troy-based Kelly Services and now works for BorgWarner, an Auburn Hills-based auto supplier. Paul N. Whelan, 48, of Novi was arrested Dec. 28, 2018, by the Russian government and accused of espionage. His family insists he's innocent, saying he was detained by mistake. In this undated photograph, he is seen holding a family dog. Whalen family photo. His brother said he'd traveled to Russia on Dec. 22 to help a friend from the Marines who was getting married in Moscow. The friend had asked Whelan to help his American family and friends get around in Russia. ""The friend asked if Paul could come and help because his family was going to Russia and hadn’t had a lot of experience there,"" David Whelan told the Free Press. ""Paul was there to help people tour the buildings and get around what can be a difficult country to navigate."" Paul Whelan had planned to help the wedding party in Moscow through Tuesday Jan. 1. He was then scheduled to travel to St. Petersburg before returning home to Michigan on Jan. 6. But he disappeared on Dec. 28. His family said they didn't know what happened to him until Monday, when news reports trickled out saying he'd been arrested for espionage. Whelan never married and never had children, his brother said, but was very close to his parents, Rosemary and Edward Whelan. The elder Whelans live on a country road surrounded by farmland in Manchester, Michigan. The gated drive outside the home is marked, ""Dog playing in garden. Please stop and honk for entry."" When a Free Press reporter honked, however, no one came to open the gate. Rather, lights were turned off inside the two-story gray-sided house, and blinds were pulled closed. A dog could be heard barking inside. An American flag hung limp from a pole in the yard beside an old red barn as freezing rain coated the ground.

Paul Whelan, 48, of Novi was arrested in Russia on Dec. 28, 2018, and is accused of spying. Kristen Jordan Shamus/Detroit Free Press. David Whelan, who lives in Newmarket, Ontario, north of Toronto, told the Free Press that the brothers, twins, grew up in Ann Arbor and graduated in 1988 from Huron High School. They have two other siblings, a brother and a sister. Other details about Whelan's past and his ties to Russia remain an enigma, and somewhat of a contradiction. Whelan's legal trouble, work history. Though David Whelan told the Free Press that his brother was ""absolutely"" innocent and said his service in the Marines and past work in law enforcement and global security make it hard for him to believe that Paul could have broken the law ""and certainly not breaking a law of espionage,"" there's evidence that Paul Whelan has previously run afoul of the law. The Marine Corps released Whelan's service record Wednesday, showing that he was convicted in a 2008 court-martial on charges related to larceny. According to his service record, he joined the Marine Reserves on May 10, 1994, and rose to the rank of staff sergeant in December 2004. Whelan was an administrative clerk and administrative chief and was deployed for the war against Iraq in 2004 and 2006. He was convicted at a special court-martial in January 2008 on several charges related to larceny involving writing bad checks and using someone else's Social Security number. He was given a bad-conduct discharge in December 2008 at the rank of private. His family insists he's innocent, saying he is a world traveler and was detained by mistake. In this undated photograph, Paul Whelan is seen at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. Whelan family photo. Whelan's last place of duty was Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in California. While stationed in Iraq, Whelan was part of something called the Lamplighter’s Club, a group of service members who got together to enjoy good cigars. “It’s one of the unique pleasures that anyone can take advantage of, as everyone should take advantage of a fine cigar once in a while,” Whelan said in a 2007 interview posted on the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing page of the Marine Corps website. Whelan also was part of “The Rest and Recuperation Leave Program,” which authorized 15 days of leave to service members on yearlong deployments to Iraq, according to another 2007 story on the website . The military paid for the travel and most service members chose to return home, but others could travel abroad. Whelan spent his two weeks in Russia, saying in the interview that the leave program “gives those of us who are single an opportunity to travel throughout the world wherever we want to go and experience the diversity of culture.”.

During his military career, Whelan received awards that included the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation and Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal. Novi District Court records show that Whelan was also involved in landlord-tenant disputes in 2007 over nonpayment of rent while he was on active service in the military. Court records also show a case was filed against Whelan in 2011 by a Norfolk, Virginia-based debt collector for $1,210.35. Whelan said he was a Chelsea police officer from 1988-2000, and also worked for the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Department, according to his testimony in a 2013 court deposition. Whelan was hired in 2001 by Kelly Services, a Troy-based company that offers consulting, temporary workers and workforce solutions to businesses around the world. He took a military leave of absence from Kelly Services, he testified, from 2003-2008, to serve in Iraq. At Kelly Services, his title was senior manager of global security and investigations. His job included campus security as well as electronic and IT-related security. He started working in early 2017 for BorgWarner, said company spokeswoman Kathy Graham. The brother of a Novi man accused of spying in Russia tweeted Tuesday morning that the family does not doubt Paul Whelan's innocence. David Whelan wrote: ""We are deeply concerned for his safety and well-being."" There, his job involves overseeing the security of facilities, assets owned by the company and its people, Graham confirmed. She noted that Whelan does not work in information technology, nor is he responsible for cyber security or industrial espionage duties as part of his job description for BorgWarner. While BorgWarner has customers all over the world and employs 29,000 people in the U.S., Europe and Asia, none of the company's international sites is in Russia, she said. Whelan also owns an online firearms company called Kingsmead Arsenal, according to business licensing records. Its address is the same as Whelan's apartment on Wellington Drive in Novi. He testified in the 2013 deposition that he has a federal firearms license. Paul Whelan and ties to Russia. According to what to appears to be Paul Whelan’s profile on the popular Russian social media platform VKontakte, he posted “God save President Trump” — flanked by flag emojis — on Inauguration Day in 2016. A 2010 post referred to then-President Barack Obama as a “moron.”. Another photo showed Whelan wearing a T-shirt of the Moscow soccer club Spartak. In March 2014, around the time of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Whelan suggested that “Putin can have Alaska, as long as he takes Sarah Palin, too!” And a photo posted in August shows Whelan attending a security conference organized by the U.S. State Department. David Whelan disputes Russia’s allegation that his brother is a spy. Former CIA agent John Sipher agrees, saying Paul Whelan’s spotty military career would keep U.S. intelligence from hiring him for sensitive operations. “He absolutely does not fit the profile of someone we would use in a place like Moscow,” said Sipher, who once ran the agency’s Russia operations in Moscow. “Due to the oppressive level of counterintelligence scrutiny in Moscow, we do not put people without diplomatic immunity in harm’s way. Nor do we handle low-level intelligence collection operations in a place like Moscow.”. Is the Whelan case connected to the arrest of Maria Butina? Paul Whelan's arrest comes just a few weeks after Russian national Maria Butina agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors; she pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as an agent for the Kremlin after working for years to infiltrate American political groups, including the National Rifle Association. Although some have speculated his arrest might be an attempt by the Russians to orchestrate a trade — Butina for Paul Whelan — his brother isn't willing to presume that's what is at play. ""People have looked for conspiracies and things or connections to Ms. Butina,"" he told the Free Press on Tuesday. ""But at the end of the day, it’s just hard to know. ""I think sometimes the geopolitical spectrum is a lot more complicated than that sort of trade-off. That could be what it was, but we’re trying not to focus on what the explanation might be, and are just trying to get him home."" The Russian announcement of Paul Whelan's arrest came one day after President Vladimir Putin released a holiday greeting to President Donald Trump that stressed the importance of Russia-U.S. relations in ""ensuring strategic stability and international security."" The one-sentence message also ""reaffirmed that Russia is open to dialogue with the United States on the most extensive agenda."" U.S.-Russian relations have been battered by controversy despite Trump's frequent praise of Putin. Scores of Russian diplomats were expelled this year in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain that was linked to the Kremlin. And special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election has brought scrutiny on communications between Trump's inner circle and Russian operatives. Aaron Retish, a Wayne State University professor who has taught modern Russian and Soviet history for 16 years, has been watching developments in the Whelan case. He said the timing of Whelan's arrest strikes him as odd, given Putin's recent request to meet with Trump again. ""You could see that there could be a potential upswing in U.S.-Russian relations, especially with the U.S. pulling out of Syria, which is also something that Putin praised,"" he said. “It’s an odd time to arrest someone, but you never know what is happening behind the scenes. This is also how Putin works. When you least expect it, something like this happens.”. U.S. Rep.-elect Haley Stevens, D-Rochester Hills, who is set to take office on Thursday and whose district includes Whelan’s home and his company’s headquarters, said she has contacted the Whelan family. ""I am alarmed by Russia's detainment of one of my constituents, Paul Whelan,” she said. “I have been in touch with the Whelan family and I am committed to working with them to bring Mr. Whelan home. “Paul served our country as a Marine and law enforcement officer and we must ensure that Russia continues to meet its obligations under the Vienna Convention to provide U.S. officials access to Mr. Whelan. I am working with the State Department and will remain vigilant until Paul returns safely to his family in Michigan,” she added. The offices of U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., had no comment on Whelan's arrest or his possible release.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693121480014950116/Study-follows-children-into-adolescence-to-more-accurately-assess-type-1-diabetes-risk	Study follows children into adolescence to more accurately assess type 1 diabetes risk	"Reviewed by James Ives, MPsych Jan 3 2019. Scientists are narrowing in on checklists of both errant genes and the environmental factors that could trigger those genes to more accurately assess type 1 diabetes risk and help children and their families avoid it. ""The next five years is the time to put the puzzle together,"" says Dr. Jin-Xiong She, director of the Center for Biotechnology and Genomic Medicine at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University and Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Genomic Medicine. She is talking about the TEDDY - The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young - study that started in 2003 at MCG and five other clinical centers across four countries and is following nearly 9,000 children and their families. She is principal investigator for studies in Georgia and Florida. TEDDY also has clinical centers in Colorado, Washington, Finland, Sweden and Germany. ""This will enable us to continue working with families, collecting and analyzing samples and data, for the next five years,"" says She, who recently received a $3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to continue his part of the studies in two of the most populous and fastest-growing states in the nation. He's optimistic that the unprecedented, prospective study documenting how genes and environment collide to cause a condition that typically surfaces in youth and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, will enable prevention of the condition that affects about 1 in 300 by age 18, according to the NIH. Today there is no proven way to prevent type 1 diabetes, which hits at the heart of what TEDDY is about, She says. Two peak ages ranges for type 1 diabetes are 2-4 and 12-15 and since TEDDY began, parents have been keeping exhaustive diaries on everything from a well-baby visit to the doctor to vaccinations to over-the-counter drugs the children take. They also collect nail, stool and blood samples throughout the 15-years each child is being followed. Scientists have been analyzing it all, including the water children drink, which can vary from one metropolis to the next. The international scope of the study is enabling identification of even regional differences that may be factors in disease development. The massive data that continues to be generated by some 9,000 TEDDY families is yielding previously unknown high-risk genes and environmental factors that will ultimately lead to those genetic and environmental checklists. ""How to predict risk is an important question, but the main question of TEDDY is what can we do about that risk?"" She says. Ideally that will mean keeping the immune system of high-risk children from ever making autoantibodies against their insulin producing cells. That means screening should start early, probably within the first year of life, She says, possibly even as one of the blood tests done for newborns. Next year, TEDDY participants start turning 15; right now, the average age is about 11. TEDDY investigators project about 450 children will be persistently autoantibody positive as they reach adolescence. TEDDY investigators would like to follow those children at least into adulthood. The Georgia-Florida TEDDY contingent She leads includes about 600 children. To date 22 children have developed type 1 diabetes and another 58 are autoantibody positive. He suspects by the end of the next five years, about half those children will also have the disease. Autoantibodies are evidence that the child's immune system has started to target the child's insulin producing cells. It's the attack and eventual destruction of the beta cells by the immune system that leave children dependent on insulin therapy the rest of their lives. To date about 12 percent of TEDDY children had autoantibodies by age 10 and nearly 8 percent have multiple antibodies. But in some young children, autoantibodies disappear and now TEDDY scientists are looking at whether autoantibodies reappear when those children reach adolescence and what factors are associated with recurrence versus remission. They also are looking at which autoantibodies are associated with slow versus rapid progression to full-blown type 1 diabetes. About 10 percent of children who develop autoantibodies don't develop disease and those children likely hold insight as well. They suspect over the next five years as children age and more develop autoantibodies and/or disease, they'll find the triggering environmental factors will change as well, another reason investigators says five more years of monitoring is important. Technological advances that have occurred over the life of TEDDY also now mean they can monitor advancement from a single to multiple autoantibodies to full-blown disease. Parallel environmental exposures over that timeframe already are providing more insight into causes and logical points for intervention. To first enroll study participants, TEDDY screened for two known high-risk genes out of the handful of genes known at that time. Children with those genes - and no first-degree relative with the disease - have about a 3 percent disease risk, 10 times higher than children without those genes. Those with the genes and a first- degree relative with type 1 have about a 14 percent chance of developing type 1 diabetes . Identifying more high-risk genes should significantly improve the ability to identify risk, She says. TEDDY has helped identify multiple additional high-risk genes with more to come, he says, and future screens will likely look at a few hundred genes. ""We are working on a new test that may analyze hundreds of genes that we think will be more accurate, more predictive,"" She says. He says parallel general prevention strategies likely won't result, rather precision strategies based on a child's genetic, social, cultural, ethnic and geographical parameters. Environmental factors include dietary triggers, so the scientists are now following up on observations already made in TEDDY like the fact that adequate vitamin D levels are associated with lower risk of type 1 diabetes particularly in children with even one minor genetic variation on their vitamin D receptor gene. They've also found that exposure to probiotics in infancy decreases diabetes development risk in the highest risk children while consuming hydrolyzed infant formula - which is considered hypoallergenic and good for infants who can't digest cow milk - increases risk. Scientists anticipate these additional years of study will enable dietary interventions to emerge that help prevent disease development. They also are looking further at the psychosocial impact of the study itself as well as the disease on parents and children. TEDDY families experiencing maladjustments are offered counseling and the investigators already have noted issues such as: increased parent anxiety when an autoantibody is detected; parents who still underestimate the full impact of the disease; and parents who pursue unproven methods to prevent type 1 diabetes development. Now that at-risk children are older, they can also talk with them about the emotional and behavioral impact, and look for signs of stress like presence of the stress hormone cortisol in their toenail clippings. They also are generating data on the physical activity of the TEDDY participants and keeping measures of their body composition to explore how they might affect risk of developing autoantibodies and progression to type 1 diabetes. While weight and inactivity are considered major risk factors for type 2 diabetes, ""How much it contributes to type 1, we don't know,"" says She. ""That is why we are looking, and in the next five years, we will be able to give you an answer."" They also are following the children for development of related autoimmune diseases like celiac disease and autoimmune thyroid disease. About 9 percent of TEDDY participants, for example, have developed both celiac disease and type 1 diabetes. Autoimmune thyroid disease has genetic risk factors similar to type 1 diabetes, She says. ""They are enriched in the TEDDY population, so we also want to identify those at high risk for autoimmune thyroid disease,"" She says. That likely means also developing better screening for these conditions, which often surface much later in life. In fact, the thyroid is the most common organ affected by autoimmune disease. She and TEDDY research manager Diane Hopkins regularly laud the TEDDY families for their extraordinary commitment to the long, extensive study and recently hosted a party for about 300 TEDDY families from the two-state area they manage. Attrition has been low and some families even came back after dropping out, She notes. ""They want to help us better understand what is happening and they want to know what is happening,"" She says. ""They have become part of the extended family."" The TEDDY consortium includes collaborators and principal investigators at Morsani College of Medicine at the University of South Florida; Pacific Northwest Research Institute in Seattle; Sweden's Lund University; the University of Colorado; Germany's Helmholtz Zentrum München and Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit?

What a ridiculous comment: to put any particular group at the heart of the NHS - apart from the most sick, disabled or suffering of course - seems to go against its very ethos. Has someone just made a payment to MM or is she always like this. StealthPolarBear Thu 03-Jan-19 06:28:49. I'm sure LGB people will be thrilled. Oh, hang on... CosmicCanary Thu 03-Jan-19 06:32:07. There was only 1 health service listed that is apparently difficult to access. What are the others? Also are smears not accessible to TM? Do they not receive the automated letter from their GP like other females? Do thay not understand that having a cervix means they are at risk of cervical cancer? I am yet to be convinced TP are failed by the NHS for basic healthcare simply because they are trans. womanformallyknownaswoman Thu 03-Jan-19 06:33:27. What happened to the majority of the population if they’re going to start distinguishing sections? It would help to start there if they are.... GCAcademic Thu 03-Jan-19 06:48:37. *Also are smears not accessible to TM? Do they not receive the automated letter from their GP like other females?*. This is the result of a healthcare provider recording people's gender identity rather than their sex. This is what trans lobbyists have demanded. It would help to start there if they are... Remember the trans man on Twitter outraged because their ""life-threatening"" need for a mastectomy should have, in their mind, have taken precedence on the waiting list over a woman with breast cancer? However, the article seems to suggest an interesting change of tack from Miller on the GRA reform. Katvonbatshit Thu 03-Jan-19 06:52:21. Yup, TRAs insisted that they be treated according to gender. If that means people miss out on health screening for their biological sex then that's TRAs fault. We wouldn't want any hurt feelz would we? Katvonbatshit Thu 03-Jan-19 06:53:17. Agreed about the interesting last paragraph about sex based protections though. GCAcademic Thu 03-Jan-19 06:56:09. Yes, that and her suggestion that reform of the GRA is not really the most pressing matter in terms of trans rights. EJennings Thu 03-Jan-19 07:03:13. Oh, I think that statement should be publicised fair and wide! In fact, flash it in neon in every A&E waiting area. Print it onto postcards and hand them out in front of every Boots. Just make the T capitalised, while the other letters are only in shadow. I’m sure the voting public will be so happy to hear of MM’s priorities wrt medical care for the entire citizenry. Invisible1234 Thu 03-Jan-19 07:04:54. This shows up identity politics very clearly...to raise one group above all others is not Leftwing and definitely not Socialism... this is Thatcher's ""we have no Society"" Neoliberalism. CosmicCanary Thu 03-Jan-19 07:10:32. If they choose to opt out of female specific healthcare then that's down to them. They can still have a smear they just need to take responsibility and request one. If you have a cervix you are entitled to a smear. womanformallyknownaswoman Thu 03-Jan-19 07:26:46. Curious if this is more jockeying for position from MM due to May’s precarious status, plus point scoring. The govt spokesperson just parrots all is OK and blah blah look how much we have budgeted whilst MM attempts to keep women and Stonewall on-side to keep her status. Nothing of substance from either ... ProfessoressWoland Thu 03-Jan-19 07:31:45. “My advice to ministers is that they should be clear that there is no threat to single-sex services, they are clearly protected in law and they need to be clearer on that,” she said. Just repeating the word 'clear' doesn't make the issues go away. MindTheMinotaur Thu 03-Jan-19 07:32:38. I read it that she's trying to distance herself from GRA reforms. Apparently the priority was service access and changes to GRC were not the key issue. Trinity333 Thu 03-Jan-19 07:35:26. This makes me so angry, especially the bit about other people being able to take basic healthcare for granted. I have a 7 year old severely disabled child. When he was born his appointments were regular and all was ok. I have seen things get worse and worse over the years. Now if a consultant says he will see my son in 3 months I know I will have to chase as I won’t hear. Blood tests are currently 9 months overdue and I’m getting nowhere with chasing. So many of his basic needs such as appropriate dental care etc are a fight and remain inaccessible, yet apparently it’s trans people who need special attention. If he didn’t have me to advocate for him his health would be in a poor state. No Maria Miller, other people cannot take basic healthcare for granted, trans people are not more important than anyone else. Stop pandering to their victim mentality. ProfessoressWoland Thu 03-Jan-19 07:42:58. The Independent two years ago:. “The only negative reaction that I’ve seen has been by individuals purporting to be feminists,” Ms Miller said. Many are furious with her call for women’s refuges to ensure equal access to people who have transitioned from male to female. She praised the “important work” of single-sex services, such as rape crisis centres. “But those sorts of services should be supporting trans women,” she insisted. donquixotedelamancha Thu 03-Jan-19 07:43:59. Many trans people simply don’t have access to the basic healthcare that the rest of us take for granted – things like cervical smears are often things that trans men are not able to access. If this is true, it's terrible; but why would it be true? How would being trans stop anyone accessing their GP or A and E? If she doesn't really mean basic health care, but actually a few specific problems, then what are they? Even the one example given seems a reach- maybe having a GRC stops the reminder letters being sent? silentcrow Thu 03-Jan-19 07:44:03. Imagine if any other minority group was in that sentence. ""Putting blind people at the heart of the NHS."" ""Putting Asian people at the heart of the NHS."" ""Putting Pagans at the heart of the NHS."" I don't think you could even get away with saying ""children"" or ""the elderly"" without at least one newspaper going ballistic. We need to keep pushing this question, why is this cause elevated over all others? Vegilante Thu 03-Jan-19 07:46:25. Message deleted by MNHQ. Here's a link to our Talk Guidelines. OtepotiLilliane42 Thu 03-Jan-19 07:56:23. The Telegraph has an article on this subject too, which I can't access, but I did read the comments, which were very critical of Maria Miller. RiotAndAlarum Thu 03-Jan-19 08:23:12. That Independent article is complete mush, to anyone who can't hear ""dog-whistles."" Nothing is ever spelled out! I understand that political types like to leave room to manoeuvre between interest groups, but the ""journalistic technique"" of ""giving them enough rope"" is often indistinguishable from not challenging interviewees! Trinity333 Thu 03-Jan-19 09:14:44. assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/730396/lgbt-action-plan-easy-read-lo-res_v2. This LGBT action plan that was referred to seems to be based on the very subjective experiences of trans people. For example having to wait too long for healthcare, was there a waiting time given or did the correspondents just feel it was too long? My oldest child had to,wait 2 years to see CAMHS then waited another 3 to get an autism diagnosis. In that time he missed out on so much support that would have helped him at school and we are now working through the anxiety that that experience has left him with. I am sure his current mental health issues would be less had he been able to access mental health services much sooner. I really think that these people live in their own entitled little worlds and do not appreciate that their struggles are no worse than other groups of people in need of help. starcrossedseahorse Thu 03-Jan-19 09:26:06. I think that this may be the start of the row back from GRA reform and it's a biscuit thrown to the baying transactivist hounds. It could be a chink of light for us. PineappleSunrise Thu 03-Jan-19 09:35:39. I am imagining a situation in which a transman doesn't get his reminder for a cervical smear because he's had his gender changed on NHS systems and - because they have conflated it with sex - he is no longer registered as being what he is, that is a female-bodied person with modifications and ongoing longterm hormone treatments. The solution appears to be to register sex and note preferred gender separately, with the former enabling appropriate health care and the latter allowing politeness.

Of course doing this wouldn’t grab headlines or further the trans agenda much though.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693245642603326109/MS-Ireland--::-Helping-Everyone-Affected-by-Multiple-Sclerosis	MS Ireland  :: Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis	"MS Ireland  ::. Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. NAI Publish Report. Wednesday January 02 2019 12:48 PM. Neurology Patients would welcome more information when they are diagnosed. A newly published report by the Neurological Alliance reveals that over half of patients surveyed reported they did not receive sufficient information at the time of diagnosis, including details of relevant patient support organisations. The findings come from the first ever patient experience survey of neurology services carried out by the Neurological Alliance. The survey examined a range of aspects of patient experience at their most recent appointment including waiting times, privacy, opportunity to ask questions and provision of information about medications, reasons for any treatment etc. Respondents were also asked about their diagnosis and how this was communicated at the time as well as their overall experience of neurology services. While a majority of service users were broadly satisfied with many aspects of their patient experience, there is a clear need to address information provision, especially at the time of diagnosis. Mags Rogers, Executive Director with the Neurological Alliance said "" If patients are telling us that they want more information we need to listen to this. While the small sample size and other limitations make it difficult to generalise from this research, it is an indication that further investigation is needed in order to understand and improve the experience of neurology patients at this most critical time in their lives"".

""I just really wanted to be able to do a first dance and I was watching YouTube videos and things like that and it just wasn't teaching me anything."" After putting off finding a wheelchair dance class for quite some time, Capella finally decided to join a local class - Free Wheelin' - just a month before her wedding day. ""It was really scary,"" Capella said. But the group made her feel ""really welcome,"" she added. ""I went every week and we just did general dances, but the teacher would take me to one side and teach me things that I'd need for my first dance."" Capella and her then- fiancé , Adam, would them go home and practice the dance themselves. The couple shared their special moment on May 27. ""It was better than I thought,"" Capella said. ""I was really worried that I was going to crash into him, he was going trip over me, but it went really, really well."" The new bride even plans to continue dancing with the group. ""I am definitely going to keep at it now because I've got a whole new group of friends,"" she said. :::::::.

Hi Everyone- I’m Paula Brown and I’m new to this sight. In November, I released an Open Letter of Thankfulness revealing my diagnosis:. I am Judge Paula Brown and I serve you as an Appeals Court Judge on the Louisiana Court of. Appeal, Fourth Circuit. Many of you who know me, know that I am a breast cancer survivor—I was diagnosed in 2008 during my first run for judge of Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (I did not win that election). In 2009, during my second run for district court judge, I was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia (TN). TN, also known as “suicide disease,” is a chronic pain disorder affecting the trigeminal nerve that produces episodes of severe, sudden, sharp, shock-like excruciating pain on one side of the face. There is, arguably, no worse pain than the pain of TN. In early 2010, I won my election for and was seated as a district court judge of Civil District Court; I lost my mother not long afterwards; and later that year, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). Some may ask why am I writing this open letter—quite frankly, I was compelled to write it! I write to bring awareness to TN and MS, diseases of which many may suffer from in silence, like I did; and I write in hopes that my testimony might be a blessing and serve as encouragement to someone else suffering from these diseases. Because I truly believe, “For unto whomever much is given, of him shall be much required.” (Luke 12:48 KJV). Despite my diagnoses, I am filled with a tremendous amount of faith, gratitude and thankfulness. I am confident that I have been elevated to the appellate court to not only serve you as a judge, but to give a voice to the voiceless. So to those who are fighting breast cancer, to those suffering with TN and to those who have been diagnosed with MS, I say to you, “You are not alone . . . I stand with you!”. On this day and every day, I am grateful for the tribulations because what doesn’t kill you only makes you stronger. That’s why I smile! I wrote this during Thanksgiving but it is certainly appropriate on this day of the year. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays,. Dec 26, 2018 12:09 AM. Hello Judge and welcome. I think you are our first justice here, nice of you to visit with us. I am glad you are fighting in Orleans, they need one tough cookie to fight for them and you seem to be she. Your letter is a good reminder for us to look for those things for which to be thankful, everyday. And congratulations on all your successes. Dec 27, 2018 9:29 PM. Maria- Thank you so much for you warm welcome! I think I have landed in the right place. Thanks again,. Dec 27, 2018 2:08 PM. Paula Brown,. You are courageous, strong, victorious, and resilient! Thank you for sharing this with us. It is definitely uplifting and encouraging to all who read your honest and heartfelt words. Thank you for choosing to be a voice to the voiceless. That is so powerful. YAH bless you. Dec 27, 2018 9:44 PM. Hi Hanna- Thank you for your kind words. I realized a long time ago that it’s not about me...I’m just a vessel.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531972474508957/Discussions---MS-Connection	Discussions - MS Connection	Dec 25, 2018 10:12 PM. Symptom or no??*. Hey everyone,. I have some issues and was wondering if they were related to the disease or not. I can't find information for this anywhere. Since the onset of my struggle with MS, I have seen a drastic decline in my sexual desire whenever I have a relapse. I know that this is a symptom of MS. But for me it goes further than that. I don't want to be touched at all. I don't want to be kissed. Nor do I want to give hugs or kisses or even have my back rubbed by my husband. This is causing a lot of strain on my marriage. Is this related to the disease or is this something else entirely? My husband doesn't think the two are related and keeps asking me if I want a divorce. I'm getting so frustrated because I don't want tto be touched ever and he will kiss me or try to hug me or ask me to cuddle with him and it makes me insane with anger. Am I just completely crazy or is this normal for others with MS? I'm new to all of this and I don't know a single soul who has it. He feels like I don't love him anymore and I feel like he's disrespecting me by constantly asking me to do anything with him, even kiss him. I love my husband. I'm very much attracted to him. But just the thought of even being kissed or touched by anybody makes me sick. The thought of anything sexual makes me cringe to no end. Please help!! Dec 25, 2018 11:38 PM. hello crystal, first might i suggest you sit and write you husband a love letter, letting him know how much you care for him and how awful your body feels, tell the truth and it will shine through the page. Talk with him about sex. Communication is the only thing that works. Let him know how your body feels. And what you have to do for you is scan your body from head to toe, notice any tightness in the muscles, spasms are things that numb the nerves, the muscles become so tight they have deadened the nerves to the tightness. When we have an exacerbation or whatever you choose to call it, it is an episode that effects the entire body, every nerve is fired up to do something and it does anything and everything. We walk into walls, drop things, fall, slur speech, forget, get confused, get disoriented all of the above all at once, all the wiring in our bodies gets tied up in knots, and the more episodes we have closer together the tighter the knots get and the more twisted the wiring, and we look fine, and we look at ourselves in the mirror and see nothing abby normal! So we think we are fine even though we feel lousy. Spend some time using your fingertips touching your arms, legs, face etc, describe to yourself what it feels like, hot cold, stiff soft, pain. If it is pain, figuring out the why is important, spasm? You can also ask your husband to put his hand on your arm, very gently, softly and tell him what it feels like, and you do the same for him, put your hand on him and tell him what you feel. If you want your marriage to flourish talk, talk and talk some more. This is a journey you are sharing and the more he understands the more you both will grow - together. He has no idea what you are going through and unless you share with him, he will imagine whatever his imagination can come up with. Painful sex is a bummer feeling unloved is worse. Dec 26, 2018 11:31 AM. Hi crystalstill,. Thank you so much for posting this- some of these symptoms are the most difficult to contend with, and so rarely discussed openly. In addition to the great feedback that Maria provided, I wanted to share our information about intimacy and sexuality and MS:. Intimacy and Sexuality.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295955438071902/Multiple-Sclerosis-Drug-Impacts-on-Neural-Pathway-to-Reduce-Anxiety-in-Mice	Multiple Sclerosis Drug Impacts on Neural Pathway to Reduce Anxiety in Mice	Dec 12, 2018. In genetically engineered mice lacking the protein called importin alpha-5 (right), a molecule called MeCP2 (red), known to affect anxiety behaviors, stayed on the outside the nuclei (blue) of brain neurons, instead of getting inside the nuclei, as it does in regular mice (left). Images obtained with a confocal microscope and displayed using computational reconstruction. [Weizmann Institute of Science]. Scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science have identified a molecular pathway in the brain that can be targeted to reduce anxiety. Their studies showed how symptoms of anxiety were reduced in mice engineered to lack a single protein, while normal animals treated using an existing multiple sclerosis drug that impacts on the same pathway remained similarly calm in stressful situations. Describing the research in Cell Reports , the researchers suggested that their findings could pave the way to the development of effective new treatments for anxiety that have fewer side effects than existing drugs. “Our findings have opened up a new direction for research into the mechanisms of anxiety,” said Nicolas Panayotis, Ph.D., at the Weizmann Institute’s department of biomolecular sciences. “If we understand exactly how the circuitry that we’ve discovered controls anxiety, this may help develop new drugs, or direct the use of existing ones, to alleviate its symptoms.” The studies are described in a paper titled, “ Importin α5 Regulates Anxiety through MeCP2 and Sphingosine Kinase 1 .”. Severe anxiety and stress-related disorders are estimated to affect up to one in three people in their lifetime. Several hormones and neurotransmitters have been implicated in anxiety, but intracellular transport systems haven’t been studied in this context, the authors wrote. Current drugs may also have limited utility, and cause unwanted side effects. “Current therapies for anxiety disorders either directly affect neurotransmitter receptor systems or modulate neurotransmitter levels or availability, but their long-term use is limited by problematic side effects and suboptimal efficacy,” the authors wrote. :::::::. 	0	0	Multiple|Sclerosis|Drug|Impacts|on|Neural|Pathway|to|Reduce|Anxiety|in|Mice	Dec|12|,|2018|.|In|genetically|engineered|mice|lacking|the|protein|called|importin|alpha|-|5|(|right|)|,|a|molecule|called|MeCP|2|(|red|)|,|known|to|affect|anxiety|behaviors|,|stayed|on|the|outside|the|nuclei|(|blue|)|of|brain|neurons|,|instead|of|getting|inside|the|nuclei|,|as|it|does|in|regular|mice|(|left|)|.|Images|obtained|with|a|confocal|microscope|and|displayed|using|computational|reconstruction|.|[|Weizmann|Institute|of|Science|]|.|Scientists|at|the|Weizmann|Institute|of|Science|have|identified|a|molecular|pathway|in|the|brain|that|can|be|targeted|to|reduce|anxiety|.|Their|studies|showed|how|symptoms|of|anxiety|were|reduced|in|mice|engineered|to|lack|a|single|protein|,|while|normal|animals|treated|using|an|existing|multiple|sclerosis|drug|that|impacts|on|the|same|pathway|remained|similarly|calm|in|stressful|situations|.|Describing|the|research|in|Cell|Reports|,|the|researchers|suggested|that|their|findings|could|pave|the|way|to|the|development|of|effective|new|treatments|for|anxiety|that|have|fewer|side|effects|than|existing|drugs|.|“|Our|findings|have|opened|up|a|new|direction|for|research|into|the|mechanisms|of|anxiety|,|”|said|Nicolas|Panayotis|,|Ph|.|D|.|,|at|the|Weizmann|Institute|’|s|department|of|biomolecular|sciences|.|“|If|we|understand|exactly|how|the|circuitry|that|we|’|ve|discovered|controls|anxiety|,|this|may|help|develop|new|drugs|,|or|direct|the|use|of|existing|ones|,|to|alleviate|its|symptoms|.|”|The|studies|are|described|in|a|paper|titled|,|“|Importin|α5|Regulates|Anxiety|through|MeCP|2|and|Sphingosine|Kinase|1|.|”|.|Severe|anxiety|and|stress-related|disorders|are|estimated|to|affect|up|to|one|in|three|people|in|their|lifetime|.|Several|hormones|and|neurotransmitters|have|been|implicated|in|anxiety|,|but|intracellular|transport|systems|haven|’|t|been|studied|in|this|context|,|the|authors|wrote|.|Current|drugs|may|also|have|limited|utility|,|and|cause|unwanted|side|effects|.|“|Current|therapies|for|anxiety|disorders|either|directly|affect|neurotransmitter|receptor|systems|or|modulate|neurotransmitter|levels|or|availability|,|but|their|long-term|use|is|limited|by|problematic|side|effects|and|suboptimal|efficacy|,|”|the|authors|wrote|.|::|:|.

Yes, this is the advice I've gotten from multiple neurologists. There are distinct problems/downsides from using steroids too frequently. Dec 22, 2018 8:20 AM. I'm sad to welcome you to MS Bethany. Your funny bone line exactly is the term I often used. I had my first major attack about a year older than you are now. The good news is that those feelings can lessen or disappear. The bad news, of course, is that they could get worse and no one can predict the course of your disease. As others have offered, there are some things you can do. But I hope you have decent health insurance in our barbaric country with no national health care; in the future, you'll always want to pay attention to that issue until we join the ranks of civilized countries and adopt a sane health care system. Thus, I hope you'll soon see your neurologist who will offer his views/treatments/suggestions. 	1	1	Discussions|-|MS|Connection	Dec|20|,|2018|8:|52|AM|.|How|do|I|know|when|to|get|steroids|?|*|.|Dec|20|,|2018|12:49|PM|.|Hello|bethanyrc|,|.|I|included|some|links|below|from|our|website|that|I|think|will|be|helpful|.|The|first|discusses|numbness|and|the|other|addresses|managing|relapses|.|MS|Symptoms|:|Numbness|.|Stephanie|,|MS|Navigator|.|Dec|22|,|2018|8:|23|AM|.|maria|1|wrote|:|Maybe|a|better|answer|,|I|only|go|for|steroids|when|I|am|desperate|and|have|no|alternative|,|.|Yes|,|this|is|the|advice|I've|gotten|from|multiple|neurologists|.|There|are|distinct|problems|/|downsides|from|using|steroids|too|frequently|.|Dec|22|,|2018|8:|20|AM|.|I'm|sad|to|welcome|you|to|MS|Bethany|.|Your|funny|bone|line|exactly|is|the|term|I|often|used|.|I|had|my|first|major|attack|about|a|year|older|than|you|are|now|.|The|good|news|is|that|those|feelings|can|lessen|or|disappear|.|The|bad|news|,|of|course|,|is|that|they|could|get|worse|and|no|one|can|predict|the|course|of|your|disease|.|As|others|have|offered|,|there|are|some|things|you|can|do|.|But|I|hope|you|have|decent|health|insurance|in|our|barbaric|country|with|no|national|health|care|;|in|the|future|,|you'll|always|want|to|pay|attention|to|that|issue|until|we|join|the|ranks|of|civilized|countries|and|adopt|a|sane|health|care|system|.|Thus|,|I|hope|you'll|soon|see|your|neurologist|who|will|offer|his|views|/|treatments|/|suggestions|.

MS is something I’m trying to but in the background completely but I realize as I am doing great not the future is highly unknown, for everyone, MS or no MS it’s true. It’s really bugging me though about my future still even tho 14-15 months after dx I am relapse free and stable with minimal sx from dx flare. MS has wiped out my livelihood, broke up with a 6 year relationship and single now and have no one by my side any longer. I have a large credit debt to manage and struggling to find a job (I’m trying) my part time gig barely keeps the wolves at the door... thankfully I’m living with my parents but they are aging... dads an alcoholic and mom has cancer and is declining. Im working out as often as I can but the stress is significant I find. im not feeling great right now and as much a I try to focus on the positives it’s hard every day. I haven’t felt truly good in a long, long time. Ill list the positives, which I feel helps me recognize them:. -I’m gonna enter into a justice studies diploma in sept. -my ex business partner owes me a buyout of $4,000.00 which I’ll get in April/May, plus a $450.00 royalty on my website for the business will start monthly. -even with my peanuts pay I’m managing to tuck away $600.00 a month. -I’ll likely find a ground level construction job with my trade experience. -I’m healthy aside from having MS MS is very quiet right now. -keep telling myself the though times will pass... but I just don’t see an end for years. theres my rant, had to blow some steam.. some Christmas this year : (. 	1	1	I|’|m|getting|overwhelmed	Ok|,|I|just|seriously|need|to|vent|...|im|feeling|overwhelmed|,|not|by|MS|Sx|but|life|in|general|.|MS|is|something|I|’|m|trying|to|but|in|the|background|completely|but|I|realize|as|I|am|doing|great|not|the|future|is|highly|unknown|,|for|everyone|,|MS|or|no|MS|it|’|s|true|.|It|’|s|really|bugging|me|though|about|my|future|still|even|tho|14-15|months|after|dx|I|am|relapse|free|and|stable|with|minimal|sx|from|dx|flare|.|MS|has|wiped|out|my|livelihood|,|broke|up|with|a|6|year|relationship|and|single|now|and|have|no|one|by|my|side|any|longer|.|I|have|a|large|credit|debt|to|manage|and|struggling|to|find|a|job|(|I|’|m|trying|)|my|part|time|gig|barely|keeps|the|wolves|at|the|door|...|thankfully|I|’|m|living|with|my|parents|but|they|are|aging|...|dads|an|alcoholic|and|mom|has|cancer|and|is|declining|.|Im|working|out|as|often|as|I|can|but|the|stress|is|significant|I|find|.|im|not|feeling|great|right|now|and|as|much|a|I|try|to|focus|on|the|positives|it|’|s|hard|every|day|.|I|haven|’|t|felt|truly|good|in|a|long|,|long|time|.|Ill|list|the|positives|,|which|I|feel|helps|me|recognize|them|:|.|-|I|’|m|gonna|enter|into|a|justice|studies|diploma|in|sept|.|-|my|ex|business|partner|owes|me|a|buyout|of|$|4,000|.|00|which|I|’|ll|get|in|April|/|May|,|plus|a|$|450.00|royalty|on|my|website|for|the|business|will|start|monthly|.|-|even|with|my|peanuts|pay|I|’|m|managing|to|tuck|away|$|600.00|a|month|.|-|I|’|ll|likely|find|a|ground|level|construction|job|with|my|trade|experience|.|-|I|’|m|healthy|aside|from|having|MS|MS|is|very|quiet|right|now|.|-|keep|telling|myself|the|though|times|will|pass|...|but|I|just|don|’|t|see|an|end|for|years|.|theres|my|rant|,|had|to|blow|some|steam|..|some|Christmas|this|year|:|(|.

The retrospective study, “ Multiple sclerosis risk factors contribute to onset heterogeneity ,” was published in the journal Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders . MS, a neurodegenerative and autoimmune disease, is associated with both genetic and environmental risk factors. Although both have been thoroughly investigated, the “processes contributing to heterogeneity in the clinical manifestation of the disease remain unclear,” the researchers wrote. Multiple studies show that each patient’s characteristics at disease onset — such as age, number of impaired functional domains (NIFDs; functions ranging from walking and balance, to problems with vision, fatigue, or limb numbness or pain), time to second relapse (TT2R), and early relapse activity (ERA) — can help to predict MS activity and progression. But factors are also likely to play a role in early disease presentation. To pinpoint the mechanisms involved in disease variability and progression, researchers at Case Western Reserve University investigated the influence of those factors with known links to early disease presentation. Their study analyzed data on 1,515 people in the Accelerated Cure Project Repository , an open-access resource containing clinical records from a U.S. population of MS patients. Machine learning and mathematical models were used to assess the relevance of each measure for each disease outcome. :::::::. 	1	0	MS|Views|and|News|::|Each|Major|Risk|Factor|-|Like|Genes|,|Smoking|and|Obesity|-|Can|Affect|Disease|Course|,|Study|Finds	Risk|factors|often|associated|with|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|,|such|as|genetic|background|,|obesity|and|smoking|,|contribute|independently|to|the|disease|’|s|variability|and|may|be|an|early|influence|on|progression|,|a|study|reported|.|The|retrospective|study|,|“|Multiple|sclerosis|risk|factors|contribute|to|onset|heterogeneity|,|”|was|published|in|the|journal|Multiple|Sclerosis|and|Related|Disorders|.|MS|,|a|neurodegenerative|and|autoimmune|disease|,|is|associated|with|both|genetic|and|environmental|risk|factors|.|Although|both|have|been|thoroughly|investigated|,|the|“|processes|contributing|to|heterogeneity|in|the|clinical|manifestation|of|the|disease|remain|unclear|,|”|the|researchers|wrote|.|Multiple|studies|show|that|each|patient|’|s|characteristics|at|disease|onset|—|such|as|age|,|number|of|impaired|functional|domains|(|NIFDs|;|functions|ranging|from|walking|and|balance|,|to|problems|with|vision|,|fatigue|,|or|limb|numbness|or|pain|)|,|time|to|second|relapse|(|TT2R|)|,|and|early|relapse|activity|(|ERA|)|—|can|help|to|predict|MS|activity|and|progression|.|But|factors|are|also|likely|to|play|a|role|in|early|disease|presentation|.|To|pinpoint|the|mechanisms|involved|in|disease|variability|and|progression|,|researchers|at|Case|Western|Reserve|University|investigated|the|influence|of|those|factors|with|known|links|to|early|disease|presentation|.|Their|study|analyzed|data|on|1,515|people|in|the|Accelerated|Cure|Project|Repository|,|an|open-access|resource|containing|clinical|records|from|a|U|.|S|.|population|of|MS|patients|.|Machine|learning|and|mathematical|models|were|used|to|assess|the|relevance|of|each|measure|for|each|disease|outcome|.|::|:|.

Treatment with Ampyra ( dalfampridine ) for 24 weeks leads to sustained and clinically meaningful improvements in walking ability as reported by multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with gait difficulties, according to a study analyzing results from a Phase 3 trial. The study, “ Assessment of Clinically Meaningful Improvements in Self-Reported Walking Ability in Participants with Multiple Sclerosis: Results from the Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III ENHANCE Trial of Prolonged-Release Fampridine ” was published in the journal CNS Drugs . More than 90 percent of MS patients have difficulty walking, which reduces their independence and negatively affects their quality of life and productivity. Ampyra (prolonged-release dalfampridine tablets) is an approved MS medication marketed by Acorda Therapeutics in the U.S. It is the first therapy specifically approved to help improve walking in adults with MS. A generic version of #Ampyra was made available this year in the U.S. by Mylan . In Europe, the medicine is approved under the brand name Fampyra , being marketed by Biogen . An international group of researchers involved in the clinical trial ENHANCE — a large study evaluating Ampyra’s efficacy — conducted the present study to see whether the therapy could improve, in a clinically meaningful way, the walking ability of MS patients based on data from the trial. :::::::. 	1	0	#Ampyra|Significantly|Improves|Walking|Ability|As|Reported|by|MS|Patients|,|Phase|3|Trial|Shows	December|19|,|2018|.|Treatment|with|Ampyra|(|dalfampridine|)|for|24|weeks|leads|to|sustained|and|clinically|meaningful|improvements|in|walking|ability|as|reported|by|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|patients|with|gait|difficulties|,|according|to|a|study|analyzing|results|from|a|Phase|3|trial|.|The|study|,|“|Assessment|of|Clinically|Meaningful|Improvements|in|Self-Reported|Walking|Ability|in|Participants|with|Multiple|Sclerosis|:|Results|from|the|Randomized|,|Double-Blind|,|Phase|III|ENHANCE|Trial|of|Prolonged-Release|Fampridine|”|was|published|in|the|journal|CNS|Drugs|.|More|than|90|percent|of|MS|patients|have|difficulty|walking|,|which|reduces|their|independence|and|negatively|affects|their|quality|of|life|and|productivity|.|Ampyra|(|prolonged-release|dalfampridine|tablets|)|is|an|approved|MS|medication|marketed|by|Acorda|Therapeutics|in|the|U|.|S|.|It|is|the|first|therapy|specifically|approved|to|help|improve|walking|in|adults|with|MS|.|A|generic|version|of|#Ampyra|was|made|available|this|year|in|the|U|.|S|.|by|Mylan|.|In|Europe|,|the|medicine|is|approved|under|the|brand|name|Fampyra|,|being|marketed|by|Biogen|.|An|international|group|of|researchers|involved|in|the|clinical|trial|ENHANCE|—|a|large|study|evaluating|Ampyra|’|s|efficacy|—|conducted|the|present|study|to|see|whether|the|therapy|could|improve|,|in|a|clinically|meaningful|way|,|the|walking|ability|of|MS|patients|based|on|data|from|the|trial|.|::|:|.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Tuesday December 18 2018 03:08 PM. Stress is a normal part of everyday life and our stress response is the body’s way of protecting us. In small doses, it is a powerful force that helps us overcome challenges, excites us into action and helps us stay focused. Having a balanced lifestyle is the best strategy for managing stress but it is now during Christmas that retaining this sense of balance can be most challenging. Managing Stress Levels. When it comes to Christmas time, the planning, shopping and socialising can send stress levels way out of control. Our reactions get in the way of clear thinking, we fail to accurately ‘read’ other people, decision making falls to the wayside and we ignore our personal needs. Living is not about avoiding stress but knowing how to manage your stress when you recognise it. Am I Stressed? Managing stress levels is the key to having a good Christmas. If the turkey gets burned, the dogs eat the cushions and discussions get heated, being able to manage your stress will help you stay balanced and, no matter what, come through the challenges. Know what stress ‘feels’ like for you and recognise some of the early signs:. Managing and Responding. How we manage and respond to stress is the key to achieving the positive outcomes to relieving the symptoms of being over-stressed. If you shut down, withdraw and disconnect from people when you feel stressed, try doing something that stimulates and energises you. Go for a walk, play with the children, play a game. If you get angry, loose the head with people and ‘see red’, you will respond best to something that soothes and calms you. Go for a walk, do some yoga stretching, relax in a quiet room for 30 minutes, listen to relaxing music. Identify What Works For You. We all have different needs and different methods that work for us. Building a ‘tool-kit’ of methods that help ease our stress ensures we choose suitable techniques at different times and situations. The more you allow stress to build up, the more difficult it can be to re-balance. Strategies to prevent this involved stimulating your senses to invigorate and soothe you. Techniques for stress relief will have immediate results and be something we can do straight away. Exercise, plenty of rest and relaxation are the overall ‘goodies’ to remember. DIY Stress-Busters/ Quick Tips for Christmas Calm! Move: Dance around, wiggle your toes/hands; do some yoga stretches, stamp your feet, go for a walk. Mindfulness/Meditation: Stay ‘present’ and focus on your breathing; use meditation techniques, be contemplative and just ‘be’ in the moment.. Taste: Sip a nice warm cup of tea; savour a nice piece of fruit and relish eating a piece of your favourite Christmas treat. Smell: Light a scented candle; make a mulled drink using delicious spices, fresh oranges and cloves/cinnamon; enjoy the smell of a ‘real’ Christmas tree,. Hearing: Listen to your favourite music, sing Christmas songs, enjoy the sounds of nature when out for your post-dinner walk. Touch: Pet the dog/cat, wrap up cosy and warm in a soft blanket, wear your favourite soft winter jumper, enjoy the hugs from friends and family. Sight: Snuggle up to a flaming fire, hang holly/ivy wreaths on your door, buy a Poinsettia, watch an uplifting Christmas film, cosy up with a new book. At this time of year, if you are fortunate enough to share it with family and friends, take time to be thankful and enjoy what is good about your life. Focus on what you can accomplish over the holidays and make the most of your time. Do things you enjoy with people you like and no matter what the Christmas challenges are, you’ll be set for calm start to the New Year 2019. Happy Christmas and a Peaceful New Year. 	0	0	MS|Ireland|::|Helping|Everyone|Affected|by|Multiple|Sclerosis	MS|Ireland|::|.|Helping|Everyone|Affected|by|Multiple|Sclerosis|.|Tuesday|December|18|2018|03:08|PM|.|Stress|is|a|normal|part|of|everyday|life|and|our|stress|response|is|the|body|’|s|way|of|protecting|us|.|In|small|doses|,|it|is|a|powerful|force|that|helps|us|overcome|challenges|,|excites|us|into|action|and|helps|us|stay|focused|.|Having|a|balanced|lifestyle|is|the|best|strategy|for|managing|stress|but|it|is|now|during|Christmas|that|retaining|this|sense|of|balance|can|be|most|challenging|.|Managing|Stress|Levels|.|When|it|comes|to|Christmas|time|,|the|planning|,|shopping|and|socialising|can|send|stress|levels|way|out|of|control|.|Our|reactions|get|in|the|way|of|clear|thinking|,|we|fail|to|accurately|‘|read|’|other|people|,|decision|making|falls|to|the|wayside|and|we|ignore|our|personal|needs|.|Living|is|not|about|avoiding|stress|but|knowing|how|to|manage|your|stress|when|you|recognise|it|.|Am|I|Stressed|?|Managing|stress|levels|is|the|key|to|having|a|good|Christmas|.|If|the|turkey|gets|burned|,|the|dogs|eat|the|cushions|and|discussions|get|heated|,|being|able|to|manage|your|stress|will|help|you|stay|balanced|and|,|no|matter|what|,|come|through|the|challenges|.|Know|what|stress|‘|feels|’|like|for|you|and|recognise|some|of|the|early|signs|:|.|Managing|and|Responding|.|How|we|manage|and|respond|to|stress|is|the|key|to|achieving|the|positive|outcomes|to|relieving|the|symptoms|of|being|over-stressed|.|If|you|shut|down|,|withdraw|and|disconnect|from|people|when|you|feel|stressed|,|try|doing|something|that|stimulates|and|energises|you|.|Go|for|a|walk|,|play|with|the|children|,|play|a|game|.|If|you|get|angry|,|loose|the|head|with|people|and|‘|see|red|’|,|you|will|respond|best|to|something|that|soothes|and|calms|you|.|Go|for|a|walk|,|do|some|yoga|stretching|,|relax|in|a|quiet|room|for|30|minutes|,|listen|to|relaxing|music|.|Identify|What|Works|For|You|.|We|all|have|different|needs|and|different|methods|that|work|for|us|.|Building|a|‘|tool-kit|’|of|methods|that|help|ease|our|stress|ensures|we|choose|suitable|techniques|at|different|times|and|situations|.|The|more|you|allow|stress|to|build|up|,|the|more|difficult|it|can|be|to|re-balance|.|Strategies|to|prevent|this|involved|stimulating|your|senses|to|invigorate|and|soothe|you|.|Techniques|for|stress|relief|will|have|immediate|results|and|be|something|we|can|do|straight|away|.|Exercise|,|plenty|of|rest|and|relaxation|are|the|overall|‘|goodies|’|to|remember|.|DIY|Stress-Busters|/|Quick|Tips|for|Christmas|Calm|!|Move|:|Dance|around|,|wiggle|your|toes|/|hands|;|do|some|yoga|stretches|,|stamp|your|feet|,|go|for|a|walk|.|Mindfulness|/|Meditation|:|Stay|‘|present|’|and|focus|on|your|breathing|;|use|meditation|techniques|,|be|contemplative|and|just|‘|be|’|in|the|moment|..|Taste|:|Sip|a|nice|warm|cup|of|tea|;|savour|a|nice|piece|of|fruit|and|relish|eating|a|piece|of|your|favourite|Christmas|treat|.|Smell|:|Light|a|scented|candle|;|make|a|mulled|drink|using|delicious|spices|,|fresh|oranges|and|cloves|/|cinnamon|;|enjoy|the|smell|of|a|‘|real|’|Christmas|tree|,|.|Hearing|:|Listen|to|your|favourite|music|,|sing|Christmas|songs|,|enjoy|the|sounds|of|nature|when|out|for|your|post-dinner|walk|.|Touch|:|Pet|the|dog|/|cat|,|wrap|up|cosy|and|warm|in|a|soft|blanket|,|wear|your|favourite|soft|winter|jumper|,|enjoy|the|hugs|from|friends|and|family|.|Sight|:|Snuggle|up|to|a|flaming|fire|,|hang|holly|/|ivy|wreaths|on|your|door|,|buy|a|Poinsettia|,|watch|an|uplifting|Christmas|film|,|cosy|up|with|a|new|book|.|At|this|time|of|year|,|if|you|are|fortunate|enough|to|share|it|with|family|and|friends|,|take|time|to|be|thankful|and|enjoy|what|is|good|about|your|life|.|Focus|on|what|you|can|accomplish|over|the|holidays|and|make|the|most|of|your|time|.|Do|things|you|enjoy|with|people|you|like|and|no|matter|what|the|Christmas|challenges|are|,|you|’|ll|be|set|for|calm|start|to|the|New|Year|2019|.|Happy|Christmas|and|a|Peaceful|New|Year|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4690172414479884077/What-prevents-remyelination?-New-stem-cell-research-reveals-a-critical-culprit	What prevents remyelination? New stem cell research reveals a critical culprit	"What prevents remyelination? New stem cell research reveals a critical culprit. December 18, 2018,. Credit: CC0 Public Domain. New research on remyelination, the spontaneous regeneration of the brain's fatty insulator that keeps neurons communicating, could lead to a novel approach to developing treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) and other inflammatory diseases. The pre-clinical findings published today in Cell Reports by a University at Buffalo team reveal that activation of a specific transcription factor induces in adult stem cells a phenomenon called pathological quiescence. This is when adult stem cells are rendered incapable of responding to injury by producing myelin -forming oligodendrocytes. The failure to remyelinate is the key feature of MS. The paper defines the role of the previously undescribed transcription factor known as PRRX1 in human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, the cells that generate myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. Current MS research focuses largely on drugs that induce the differentiation of human oligodendrocyte progenitors. In contrast, the UB research presents a novel concept for the development of new drugs based on blocking the pathological quiescence of progenitors. ""The idea that pathological quiescence of progenitors could prevent regeneration in MS is distinct from the current pre-clinical strategies making their way into trial,"" explained Fraser Sim, Ph.D., senior author and associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB. ""We found that switching this gene on could cause problems in myelin repair by blocking the proliferation of the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell, the stem cell-like precursor that is responsible for all myelin regeneration in the adult brain,"" he said. The research demonstrated that PRRX1 expression results in the cell cycle arrest and quiescence of oligodendrocyte progenitors, which disabled the production of myelin. In an animal model of leukodystrophy, the group of genetic disorders in which myelin fails to form or is destroyed in children, Sim said that pathological quiescence induced by PRRX1 prevented cell colonization of white matter and effective myelin regeneration by transplanted human oligodendrocyte progenitors. They also found that blocking expression of this transcription factor prevented the negative effects of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-γ, which regulates its expression. ""We found that blockade of PRRX1 expression prevents the negative effects of interferon-γ, suggesting that PRRX1 expression might be a viable target in inflammatory diseases , such as multiple sclerosis, where interferon-γ may prevent successful myelin regeneration,"" said Sim. :::::::.

I would bet most of us attempt to offer support, educate or seek comfort from our peers. The reminder to be mindful of other's perspectives when posting is excellent however I don't believe the veiled insinuations that an opposing viewpoint or something prickly a stranger posts on this site is responsible for another's suicide or a reason this forum should be censored. Even before posts were delayed I don't recall seeing anything overtly mean spirited or so scathing that would have sparked concern for someone's safety. Maybe the moderators can share an estimate of how many posts they refuse to publish? I bet it isn't many. I'm probably one of the more blunt posters here and it is very rare that my responses aren't published, in fact I can't remember the last time. Its just my opinion and really it obviously isn't a deal breaker for me but I wonder if that is the reason so few people are active here now. I joined in 2006? and there were hundreds of new posts a day, literally probably 50 or so people posting at the same time all day and evening. I seriously doubt the down turn in traffic is because all the fancy new medications have resulted in miraculous outcomes so we no longer need this type of forum. All other points aside I am very appreciative of our mods who are the backbone of this board and have a very difficult job being fair and objective while also being a human with MS who has their own valid opinions, issues and experiences. He is your friend, your partner, your defender, your dog. You are his life, his love, his leader. He will be yours, faithful and true to the last beat of his heart. You owe it to him to be worthy of such devotion. 	0	0	Closing|Threads|-|Page|4	Originally|Posted|by|502E79|.|Begs|the|question|;|would|you|really|feel|ok|with|your|personal|thoughts|on|this|ever|so|serious|matter|playing|a|negative|part|in|another|life|?|Marco's|reminder|is|on|target|.|Really|Jer|?|Of|course|I|,|and|I'm|sure|no|one|else|here|,|posts|anything|with|the|intent|of|having|a|negative|impact|on|someone|else's|life|.|I|would|bet|most|of|us|attempt|to|offer|support|,|educate|or|seek|comfort|from|our|peers|.|The|reminder|to|be|mindful|of|other's|perspectives|when|posting|is|excellent|however|I|don't|believe|the|veiled|insinuations|that|an|opposing|viewpoint|or|something|prickly|a|stranger|posts|on|this|site|is|responsible|for|another's|suicide|or|a|reason|this|forum|should|be|censored|.|Even|before|posts|were|delayed|I|don't|recall|seeing|anything|overtly|mean|spirited|or|so|scathing|that|would|have|sparked|concern|for|someone's|safety|.|Maybe|the|moderators|can|share|an|estimate|of|how|many|posts|they|refuse|to|publish|?|I|bet|it|isn't|many|.|I'm|probably|one|of|the|more|blunt|posters|here|and|it|is|very|rare|that|my|responses|aren't|published|,|in|fact|I|can't|remember|the|last|time|.|Its|just|my|opinion|and|really|it|obviously|isn't|a|deal|breaker|for|me|but|I|wonder|if|that|is|the|reason|so|few|people|are|active|here|now|.|I|joined|in|2006|?|and|there|were|hundreds|of|new|posts|a|day|,|literally|probably|50|or|so|people|posting|at|the|same|time|all|day|and|evening|.|I|seriously|doubt|the|down|turn|in|traffic|is|because|all|the|fancy|new|medications|have|resulted|in|miraculous|outcomes|so|we|no|longer|need|this|type|of|forum|.|All|other|points|aside|I|am|very|appreciative|of|our|mods|who|are|the|backbone|of|this|board|and|have|a|very|difficult|job|being|fair|and|objective|while|also|being|a|human|with|MS|who|has|their|own|valid|opinions|,|issues|and|experiences|.|He|is|your|friend|,|your|partner|,|your|defender|,|your|dog|.|You|are|his|life|,|his|love|,|his|leader|.|He|will|be|yours|,|faithful|and|true|to|the|last|beat|of|his|heart|.|You|owe|it|to|him|to|be|worthy|of|such|devotion|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692885899639746753/Discussions---MS-Connection	Discussions - MS Connection	"Dec 14, 2018 5:09 PM. Worried I may be experiencing early stage symptoms*. Hello all,. I am a 23 year old male who has a family history of MS. My dad was diagnosed with RRMS before I was born and my aunt (dad's half sister) was diagnosed with RRMS as well. My dad passed away in 2014 at the age of 59 due to COPD/MS complications because he never quit smoking. Tje las tcouple of years I have been experiencing body wide muscle twitching and more frequently now, painless muscle spasms. I've also felt a buzzing feeling in my right calf my chiro says might be due to poor posture and finger twitching in my thumbs and index fingers. Because of my family history it's become a daily fear that I'm going to be dx'd with MS. My PCP didnt seem too concerned as there arent any ""visible"" signs but referred me to a neuro for peace of mind. My app is on the 27th. If anyone could give me further info on if my symptoms sound like anything they experienced before being diagnosed/or if im just workng myself up for no reason I'd appreciate it. Also, what questions should i ask my neuro and what steps should be taken to properly investigate the cause of my symptoms? Dec 15, 2018 1:08 PM. ""Invisible symptoms"" can be the worst because so many people subscribe to the house of thought that ""You don't LOOK sick."" That being said, you have a valid reason to be concerned :there is a family history so these spasms can't necessarily be explained away with bad posture or stress. You are the one experiencing these symptoms, not anyone else, so if you know what your body usually feels like and these symptoms are so NOT NORMAL, stand your ground and get your answers. Ask the neuro anything you want, but remember to tell him, or her, the story that led you to their office in the first place. As to symptoms leading up to a diagnosis, for me I had symptoms off and on for a decade (even though I didn't realize it) before I was formally diagnosed. MS affects everybody differently. I first had a loss of leg strength on the job, then nothing for about 6 years when I had another collapse; both were signed off as stress. Finally I had another collapse and had been living with numbed feet for a year. I ended up going to the e.r., got sent to another hospital that specialized in neurology, and boom: I got the answer of MS. Whatever it ends up being, don't be scared. The treatments for MS, if that is truly what it is, can enable you to live with this disease rather well. I wish you luck and hope things work out well for you. Just remember: when the going gets rough, don't forget the chocolate. Dec 16, 2018 6:08 PM. RagnaRocker95, I am sorry for your loss. I have experienced all of the symptoms you describe at some point or another. I didn't experience body-wide muscle twitching but I have had instances when my thumbs or facial muscles twitch. The muscle spasms have happened to me a lot, mostly in my legs, arms and feet. The ""buzzing feeling"" I get in my thighs especially my right thigh for some reason. Once I thought it was my phone vibrating in my pocket but then realized my phone was on the desk. :-). I'm no doctor but I doubt bad posture would cause all of these symptoms; it's absurd your Chiropractor would chalk it up as such. My PCP also didn't believe me even when I told her just a handfull off the list of all the symptoms I had experienced. When I got back from being at the hospital 5 days receivng treatment and told her about it, she looked up the medical records and then said, ""Wow they did a number on you"". Of course she saw and read the results which confirmed it is MS. That same visit she called the only neurologist in this area whom I had managed to schedule an appointment with but they could not fit me in until a month and a half out. When she told them that I have MS they then made my appointment within a week. My PCP saw the error in her ways and tried to make it up by getting me a referral; to a physical therapist. She also gave me a prescription to get a shower chair, cain, and walker. Your neurologist should have you get an MRI. MRIs are better imaging than CT scans as CT scans miss things the MRI picks up. They may also do a spinal tap and bloodwork to rule out any other possible diseases. If it does come out that you have MS, I would ask your neuro whether you have RRMS or PPMS. Then I advise you to do some research on the different Disease Modifying Treatments out there. It is best that you be informed about the different side-effects each treatment can cause so you can pick one that you think you can handle if it does give you those side-effects. If you are not informed and don't know about the DMTs, your neuro will just pick one for you. The best advice I'm going to provide you is...to be your own advocate. You know yourself better than any doctor, family member, or anyone else. Fight for yourself because if you don't, no one else will do it for you. If they do try to 'help' you, they will push things on you THEY think is best for you but may not be good for you at all. In conclusion self-advocate, research, stay informed, and take care of yourself. Good luck and know we are all still here for you regardless what happens. Dec 17, 2018 8:49 AM. Hi there,. These are some links to information on the Society's website that I thought might be relevant to your questions:. Make the Most of Your Doctor Visits. Preparing for MS Doctor Visits Telelearning (Recording). Diagnosing Tools - it may help to become familiar with the tools used to diagnose MS, to understand what the neurologist is looking for and what criteria needs to be met to make a diagnosis of MS. I hope your appointment on the 27th goes well. Please let us know how you are doing and if you have further questions. Dec 17, 2018 5:01 PM. Hi, it's the ""invisible symptoms"" that affect an upending number of PCP, who just don't get it. I went to all sorts of doctors over the years. I knew even in my 20s that there was something wrong with me because I had episodes where my legs felt like they were encased in cement or ice blocks. It was very frustrating when my first husband was always telling me to hurry up and I couldn't. And I was only in my 20s the best years of people's lives. Over the decades, I went to all sorts of doctors. It was not until I was 61 years old that they finally were able to correctly diagnosis me. My new neurologist suspected something and had me have a MRI done. I was in shock when he showed me the images of my brain and neck. Never, never had I suspected something as horrible as that. I called my last surviving aunt and it turns out that we had MS in our family and some of my cousins were in wheelchairs. I can't believe my mother never told me. Good luck on December 27 with your appointment and please get back in touch with us.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295900312447043/Oligodendrocytes,-Cells-That-Produce-Myelin,-Can-Be-Generated-from-Astrocytes,-Study-Reports	Oligodendrocytes, Cells That Produce Myelin, Can Be Generated from Astrocytes, Study Reports	BY JOSE MARQUES LOPES, PHD. A molecule known as Sox10 enables brain cells called astrocytes to convert into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, a new study in mice reports. The findings suggest an approach for myelin repair in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and similar disorders, its researchers said. The study, “ In vivo conversion of astrocytes into oligodendrocyte lineage cells with transcription factor Sox10; Promise for myelin repair in multiple sclerosis ,” was published in the journal PLOS ONE . Given the key role of oligodendrocyte pathology in MS, replacing these myelin-producing cells would be a promising therapeutic approach, particularly if autologous (of the same individual) sources of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) can be used. Astrocytes – a cell involved in the formation of the blood-brain barrier and in response to injury – are the major component of glial scars, which develop after neural cell loss caused by degenerative diseases and traumatic injuries. Prior research has shown that astrocytes may be converted into neurons (nerve cells) and stem-like cells in vitro by forcing the production of transcription factors, or molecules that control gene activity. As a result, changing astrocytes into progenitor cells has been attempted in vivo — inside a living organism — to enable tissue repair. Both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are types of glial cells. Astrocytes have been converted into myelinating cells with a micro RNA – tiny RNA molecules that also regulate gene activity – and a transcription factor not specific to oligodendrocytes. This inspired a research team at the Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology in Iran and the University of California, Davis , to look for a transcription factor specific to oligodendrocytes that also showed an ability to change astrocytes into OPCs in vivo . :::::::. 	1	0	Oligodendrocytes|,|Cells|That|Produce|Myelin|,|Can|Be|Generated|from|Astrocytes|,|Study|Reports	BY|JOSE|MARQUES|LOPES|,|PHD|.|A|molecule|known|as|Sox|10|enables|brain|cells|called|astrocytes|to|convert|into|myelin-forming|oligodendrocytes|,|a|new|study|in|mice|reports|.|The|findings|suggest|an|approach|for|myelin|repair|in|patients|with|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|and|similar|disorders|,|its|researchers|said|.|The|study|,|“|In|vivo|conversion|of|astrocytes|into|oligodendrocyte|lineage|cells|with|transcription|factor|Sox|10|;|Promise|for|myelin|repair|in|multiple|sclerosis|,|”|was|published|in|the|journal|PLOS|ONE|.|Given|the|key|role|of|oligodendrocyte|pathology|in|MS|,|replacing|these|myelin-producing|cells|would|be|a|promising|therapeutic|approach|,|particularly|if|autologous|(|of|the|same|individual|)|sources|of|oligodendrocyte|progenitor|cells|(|OPCs|)|can|be|used|.|Astrocytes|–|a|cell|involved|in|the|formation|of|the|blood-brain|barrier|and|in|response|to|injury|–|are|the|major|component|of|glial|scars|,|which|develop|after|neural|cell|loss|caused|by|degenerative|diseases|and|traumatic|injuries|.|Prior|research|has|shown|that|astrocytes|may|be|converted|into|neurons|(|nerve|cells|)|and|stem-like|cells|in|vitro|by|forcing|the|production|of|transcription|factors|,|or|molecules|that|control|gene|activity|.|As|a|result|,|changing|astrocytes|into|progenitor|cells|has|been|attempted|in|vivo|—|inside|a|living|organism|—|to|enable|tissue|repair|.|Both|astrocytes|and|oligodendrocytes|are|types|of|glial|cells|.|Astrocytes|have|been|converted|into|myelinating|cells|with|a|micro|RNA|–|tiny|RNA|molecules|that|also|regulate|gene|activity|–|and|a|transcription|factor|not|specific|to|oligodendrocytes|.|This|inspired|a|research|team|at|the|Royan|Institute|for|Stem|Cell|Biology|and|Technology|in|Iran|and|the|University|of|California|,|Davis|,|to|look|for|a|transcription|factor|specific|to|oligodendrocytes|that|also|showed|an|ability|to|change|astrocytes|into|OPCs|in|vivo|.|::|:|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4685225693897070088/Hospital-Charges-123,000-for-Two-MS-Treatments	Hospital Charges $123,000 for Two MS Treatments	By Jay Hancock, Kaiser Health News. Nov. 28, 2018 -- Shereese Hickson’s multiple sclerosis was flaring again. Spasms in her legs and other symptoms were getting worse. She could still walk and take care of her son six years after doctors diagnosed the disease, which attacks the central nervous system. Earlier symptoms such as slurred speech and vision problems had resolved with treatment, but others lingered: she was tired and sometimes still fell. This summer, a doctor switched her to Ocrevus, a drug approved in 2017 that delayed progression of the disease in clinical trials better than an older medicine did. Genentech, a South San Francisco-based subsidiary of Swiss pharma giant Roche, makes Ocrevus. It is one of several drugs for multiple sclerosis delivered intravenously in a hospital or clinic. Such medicines have become increasingly expensive as a group, priced in many cases at well over $80,000 a year. Hospitals delivering the drugs often take a cut by upcharging the drug or adding hefty fees for the infusion clinic. Hickson received her first two Ocrevus infusions as an outpatient two weeks apart in July and August. And then the bill came. Patient: Shereese Hickson, 39, single mother who worked as a health aide and trained as a medical coder, living in Girard, Ohio. Because her MS has left her too disabled to work, she is now on Medicare; she also has Medicaid for backup. Total Bill: $123,019 for two Ocrevus infusions taken as an outpatient. CareSource, Hickson’s Medicare managed-care plan, paid a discounted $28,960. Hickson got a bill for about $3,620, the balance calculated as her share by the hospital after the insurance reimbursement. :::::::.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692886081097572315/MS-Ireland--::-Helping-Everyone-Affected-by-Multiple-Sclerosis	MS Ireland  :: Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis	MS Ireland  ::. Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Inclusion Is For Everybody. Monday December 03 2018 08:00 AM. This week Grace Kavanagh writes about what the International Day of People With Disabilities means to her and what we as individuals understand about living with a disability. I’ll forgive you if you weren’t aware that there was such a thing as International Day of People With Disabilities . I wasn’t either before some research. It is an initiative set up by the UN in 1992 to promote understanding of disability issues and to raise support for those with disabilities to enable them to participate equally in society. It is held yearly on December 3rd and the theme for this year is “Inclusion is for everybody” . The day is recognised at the UN headquarters in New York with organisations and groups around the world encouraged to hold their own events. I love the idea of social equality but think in reality we have a long way to go. Raising awareness is one thing but raising understanding and empathy is quite another and this is where I think the focus should be. So what do I as a person with disability think the International Day of People With Disabilities should include? I don’t think any one person can understand all the challenges people with differing disabilities face and I certainly can’t speak for everyone. I do however think that we all need to think a bit more about other people and try not to be entirely caught up in our own worlds. We have all been guilty of unknowingly causing issues for others by our actions so here are some things to consider in our everyday lives that might have an impact on people with disabilities. ● Viewing things from the perspective of the person with a disability would help us all to see how our actions can impede others. It could also help us to be less irritated or frustrated when we understand the challenges the other person is facing. ● Experiences that give an insight into the life of someone with a disability can really boost understanding. For example the MSunderstood cafe gives people the opportunity to view the world from the perspective of someone living with MS. I’ll be sending my husband when it comes back to Dublin! ● In a similar way, I know of a charity for the visually impaired that requires employees to spend time wearing glasses that distort vision and use a wheelchair so they understand the difficulties people they work with may have. ● I taught computing to a lady with hearing difficulties. She had a sign language interpreter who enabled her to be an equal participant in the class. I learnt to address my comments to her and not her interpreter, just as I would with any other member of the class. ● Think before you park your car! Parking on pavements or up on the kerb leaves no safe route for people in wheelchairs, while parking in disabled bays when you don’t need to means a person with a disability can’t use the facility. ● Don’t get me started on the pavements in Dublin! They are a hazard to everyone but in particular those with mobility issues. Try not to add to the problem by leaving obstructions like bins on the path. Disabilities aren’t always visible. You don’t know what someone else is coping with just by looking at them. They could be living with chronic pain but look fine. Try not to judge what you don’t know.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4697150752565323202/Medicare-Annual-Election-Period:-What-You-Should-Know---MS-Connection	Medicare Annual Election Period: What You Should Know - MS Connection	The Medicare Annual Election Period (AEP), or Medicare Open Enrollment Period (OEP), has arrived. With approximately 25 to 30 percent of people with MS enrolled in Medicare, it’s important to be equipped with useful information to pick a plan that works best for you. The AEP begins on October 15 each year. From there, you have until December 7 to make changes to your plan. Any changes you make during the Annual Election Period won’t take effect until on January 1, 2019. After then, you can’t make changes to your plan unless there is a special circumstance. Here are some general things to keep in mind during this period. Changes You Can Make During the Annual Election Period. The two type of plans the Annual Election covers:. 1. Medicare Advantage plans. The changes you can make involving Medicare Advantage plans are:. * Transition from Original Medicare to a Medicare Advantage plan. 2. Stand-alone Part D drug plans. The changes you can make regarding stand-alone Part D drug plans are:. The Annual Election Period isn’t for Medigap. The biggest misconception about the Annual Election Period is that you can use it to enroll in a new Medigap plan without having to answer health questions. This is not the case. In most states, the only time you can enroll in a Medigap plan without going through medical underwriting is if you’re in your initial 6-month Medigap open enrollment window, or if you have a guaranteed issue period because you are transitioning from large employer health coverage over to Medicare as your primary coverage. You can apply anytime throughout the year. There is no need to wait for the AEP because it nothing to do with making changes to Medigap plans. Also, keep in mind that Medigap plans benefits do not change from year to year. Your Medigap plan will have the same coverage guidelines from year to year. However, Medigap monthly premiums do change. You should get a notice from your carrier prior to your plan’s anniversary date of how much your premium will increase. Review Your Annual Notice of Change (ANOC). Each year, insurance carriers will send out a letter to every Medicare Advantage and Part D policyholder. This letter is called your Annual Notice of Change, or ANOC. Your ANOC is possibly the most important item of the Fall Annual Election Period. The ANOC states what changes your carrier plans to make to your current plan for the following year, like the premium, formulary, copays, deductibles and benefits. When you receive your ANOC letter, review the changes and decide whether or not you would like to keep your current plan. Some examples of changes your plan could make that might make you want to consider changing plans are:. * Your plan won’t be covering one of your important drugs next year. Your ANOC will compare the current year’s coverage and prices next to the upcoming year’s changes so that you can easily tell what is changing. Plan Finder Tool. Medicare’s website has a helpful tool that can assist you in researching Medicare Advantage and Part D drug plans. Simply go to medicare. gov and click on “Find Health & Drug Plans.”. From there, enter your ZIP code and click “Find Plans.” The site will guide you through a few specific questions so that it can show you plans you might be interested in. Once you have landed on the page with the available plans, you will be able to click on each individual plan to see the details. Using this tool can help you compare your current plan with other available plans out there. Then, you will be able to make an informed decision about your other plan options. If you find a plan you like better, be sure to apply before the Annual Election Period ends on December 7.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531454341064305/How-do-I-tell-my-boyfriend-I-think-we-should-break-up---Page-2	How do I tell my boyfriend I think we should break up - Page 2	"Slow down and take second. I know this disease is scary! BUT take a breathe please and think this through. I know, can tell that you are and only want whats best for those around you. That your trying to something that is completely unselfish. However while trying to do a unselfish thing, you are being very selfish. I don't believe for a second that you know you are being selfish. Its just you trying to look out for others in what you see as a death sentence. This disease isn't a death sentence!!! Yes bad and not fun stuff CAN happen BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL HAPPEN. In this fun thing we call MS you can run the gamete of 100% fine to 100% ""broken"". I've been married 19 yrs and have thought similar to you. Being with someone for 18yrs is a marriage. Just because you don't have paper doesn't mean that your not married! To take away his right to stay or go.... that is selfish on your part IMO. Its different then the mom problem, your BF loves you and wants you, good, bad, ugly. I'm sorry your having such a hard time right now. I recall how it felt when I was 1st DX. You can't fight this alone and need support. From the sounds of it you have that with your BF and friends. So you may have to find a new ""normal"" for your ""fun, dating"" part of life with your BF. So ACCEPT the CHALLENGE and FIGHT! You will the spend rest of your life fighting at time for most things in life. DO NOT LET THIS DISEASE WIN AND TAKE YOUR LOVE FROM YOUR LIFE!!!! Who told you this disease was a life sentence? I genuinely would like to know? Did your doctor tell you to break up? If yes what kind of doc was it? General Dr? Do they know your BF and you have together for 18yrs? Again that's a marriage and are you saying someone like myself should leave my hubby? I was given a walker just a few months into my dx and only used it for a month or so. I was taken off of work months after my DX and told to apply for disability. I was awarded it in record time with zero fight. I was given a dx in 3 days! All of these things tell me...my MRI are for To look at me you wouldn't know I pee my pants sometimes. That my hands don't work enough for me to make cakes anymore w/out help. You don't look at me and see my walking stick I ALWAYS have in my van. Or see that my right eye has caused me A LOT of problems. Ppl don't see that I'm ALWAYS in pain or that I can't run anymore, deal with heat or cold, eat out with out feeling like crap after due to stuff added into the food. What's my point? YOU ARE OK!!! You HAVE to find a new normal or all you do is see the darkness and not any of the bright love around you!!! I don't believe in god just like you. I deal with my dad who is like your mom but taking what his says and just thinking ""hey doesn't hurt for him to pray for a cure. Doesn't hurt for him to pray for me and make himself feel better."" None of that hurts me. It all makes him feel better and thats ok. Your BF is the same way!!! What if he didn't take you up on the offer to leave because he wants to stay?!?!?! 🤯🤯🤯 What if doesn't see you as broken and damaged like you see yourself now or in the future? Yo. see only the dark BUT WHAT IF ONLY YOU SEE THAT??? Wh. t if nobody else see's you as damaged goods? Or. what if where you see caretaker they see a spouse that WANTS to WALK THROUGH LIFE WITH YOU! I'. l stop as I could write a book on this. A. riend of mine was just DX a couple months ago and feels as you do. So. I keep telling her to walk away and TRY TRY TRY to find some Light. Al.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4718739365113745871/Discussions---MS-Connection	Discussions - MS Connection	Nov 27, 2018 9:29 AM. Having trouble with standing or walking*. Nov 28, 2018 11:42 AM. Some drugs must be weaned very slowly, if your medication dosage is abruptly changed it could be causing a severe reaction. If the side effects of the drug are causing you to change the dosage on your own please discuss it with the doc, you may have a choice of another drug for ms. I can not stress enough the caution about learning how to stop a drug you are on or to change a dosage without knowledge. When betaseron was no longer working for me the doc said stop it, and I had a month of all the symptoms of ms hitting me at once, cold turkey was the wrong way to go, it should have been tapered. And when I called the company they had no information about what happens to a patient when they stop taking the betaseron! Think about the fact that you are putting something into your body and the body over time adapts to the change, then when you alter the routine the body must react especially if it is a dramatic shock therapy like we get, Remember when you first started it and what your body went through, you are doing that over and over again when you alter the routine. 	1	1	Discussions|-|MS|Connection	Nov|27|,|2018|9:29|AM|.|Having|trouble|with|standing|or|walking|*|.|Nov|28|,|2018|11:42|AM|.|Some|drugs|must|be|weaned|very|slowly|,|if|your|medication|dosage|is|abruptly|changed|it|could|be|causing|a|severe|reaction|.|If|the|side|effects|of|the|drug|are|causing|you|to|change|the|dosage|on|your|own|please|discuss|it|with|the|doc|,|you|may|have|a|choice|of|another|drug|for|ms|.|I|can|not|stress|enough|the|caution|about|learning|how|to|stop|a|drug|you|are|on|or|to|change|a|dosage|without|knowledge|.|When|betaseron|was|no|longer|working|for|me|the|doc|said|stop|it|,|and|I|had|a|month|of|all|the|symptoms|of|ms|hitting|me|at|once|,|cold|turkey|was|the|wrong|way|to|go|,|it|should|have|been|tapered|.|And|when|I|called|the|company|they|had|no|information|about|what|happens|to|a|patient|when|they|stop|taking|the|betaseron|!|Think|about|the|fact|that|you|are|putting|something|into|your|body|and|the|body|over|time|adapts|to|the|change|,|then|when|you|alter|the|routine|the|body|must|react|especially|if|it|is|a|dramatic|shock|therapy|like|we|get|,|Remember|when|you|first|started|it|and|what|your|body|went|through|,|you|are|doing|that|over|and|over|again|when|you|alter|the|routine|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695380557731626506/Fever-Fatale---MS-Connection	Fever Fatale - MS Connection	"“A fever could be life threatening.”. That single line from an old episode of “The West Wing” prompted me to immediately Google whether, in fact, a fever is fatal to someone with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, something with which I was diagnosed in the summer of 2014. Fresh from learning I had MS, this mere suggestion plunged me into a panic. A search of “fever and multiple sclerosis” yielded over 590,000 results. The first couple of articles I found told me patients who had low-grade fevers suffered more from chronic fatigue than others and that MS patients experience an exacerbation of symptoms when they’re overheated, whether from weather or internally high temps. ""But what about this life threatening business?"" I muttered to myself as I sat at my desk, freaking out over whether what I’d heard on the classic TV show was indeed true. Could a fever prove fatal, as the fictional first lady said in the drama about a president who had relapsing remitting MS? I kept digging. I inputted “fever and multiple sclerosis and west wing” in the search box. One of the pieces I found explored whether the show’s Jed Bartlet character accurately represented the real-life experiences of MS patients. While noting that the National Multiple Sclerosis Society had bestowed an award to the program for raising awareness about MS, it only briefly mentioned the fever issue, which became a major plot point after President Bartlet, who was suffering an MS flare-up, passed out in the Oval Office. His wife Abbey tearfully admitted it wasn’t the flu that was making him ill. “I see you trying to cover the panic,” the chief of staff told the first lady, imploring her to reveal what was really going on. “He has multiple sclerosis, Leo,” Abbey Bartlet said in a near-whisper. “... A fever could be life threatening.”. A newbie to all things MS, I was voraciously devouring every new piece of information about MS. This made me hyper-aware of any pop culture and news media references to the disease because MS was no longer a hypothetical or an abstract. Not too long after I learned I had MS, I started streaming the first season of “The West Wing” on my laptop and made a realization: Jed Bartlet has MS too. I vaguely remembered that from when I watched it during its original run many years ago, but the MS storyline hadn’t emotionally registered with me then. Now it did. While I searched for a nugget of truth in that fatal fever line, I came across a mention of a newspaper article quoting the then-president of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society who said, “A fever is no more deadly for people with MS than it is for the general population.”. But those petrifying pop culture MS references kept on coming and, as I was still adjusting to my post-diagnosis life, they proved jarring. There was the father in the movie “Trainwreck” who at one point couldn’t handle his MS symptoms any longer. There was the Showtime drama about the impact of an affair on two marriages, aptly named “The Affair,” whose lead character spent his teen years caring for his mother as her MS symptoms worsened, eventually leading to son-assisted suicide. After the first MS mention in The Affair, I took to Google again. As I was typing “Is MS,” the search engine auto-filled “fatal” for me. This wasn’t helpful for a nervous patient. Another TV drama, “Elementary,” decided to give MS to the girlfriend of a regular character. She promptly broke up with her police captain beau because she didn’t want her MS to become a “burden” to him. Confused, the police captain sought advice from a physician friend who warned of bleak times ahead. “MS is cruel,” the doctor character said. “The progression is gonna be tough on her, and you. It could take years or months, and once the disease really takes hold, she’s gonna need a lot of help.”. Yes, raising awareness of multiple sclerosis is a noble and necessary thing. But frightening MS patients, particularly recently-diagnosed ones, is quite another. Four years into this MS experience, my antennae remain highly sensitive to pop culture MS references (there was even one on “ This Is Us” last season that surprised me). But nowadays, I’m not nearly as reactive or as fearful as I used to be. All that research -- in addition to regularly peppering my neurologist with questions -- has enabled me to more deftly and confidently handle any new pop culture MS references, no matter how dire. Abbey Bartlet doesn’t scare me anymore.

I've been dizzy for a very, very long time. Totally exhausted all the time. Not sleeping well. I decided to get a test kit and test my own blood sugar before I go to the doctor. Just covering all bases. I don't think I have any real diabetic symptoms. I had a cup of tea with honey when I woke up.. that was all. Tested with the new kit and the reading was 148! Of course I'm freaking out. Can anyone give me any advice or suggestions or ideas why this could be so high first thing in the morning? Thanks so much Diagnosed with MS 2001.

All the autoimmune diseases are attacking me. Taking the minimum of medications. Joined : Nov 2006. Posts : 6505. Posted 11/12/2018 8:08 AM (GMT -7). Good morning Ozarker, and welcome. Yes, 148 is higher than you want. Honey can do that, but to understand this better, you would have to test yourself before you drink the tea with honey and then about two hours later. That would show you how much your blood sugar rose. It would also show you what your fasting blood sugar was (from overnight before you eat or drink anything but water). Many things can affect our blood sugar readings: food and drink, some medications, stress and illness, heredity. If there are any family members with diabetes, this would be an alert to you to watch your blood sugar. I hope that your doctor includes blood sugar tests in your annual exams. If there are results that are anywhere over 100, you and the doctor would need to be more vigilant and test more often and having a meter at home is a good choice. Sometimes if we eat late at night and have a lot of carbohydrates like potatoes or bread (any food made with flour like pasta or crackers or food made with sugar), we will find that our morning fasting numbers are high. This 'might' even happen with someone who does not have blood sugar problems. In any case, since you have a meter, I think you should keep a record of your blood sugar with times, results and what you ate and drank. You would test before eating or drinking something, write the result down with the time, then write down what you eat or drink, then test about two hours later. Don't freak out or get upset. At this point, I think you can bring your readings lower just by adjusting what you're eating. And, as I wrote above, medications can also affect blood sugar. Do you take any? Do you have any family members with diabetes? I'm glad you wrote so you can understand what's happening better! diabetes type 2 controlled by diet and exercise and. very low carb way of eating. Check out the following site for more info on blood sugar:. Posted 11/12/2018 8:30 AM (GMT -7). Thanks for the reply. I don't think there are any family members with Diabetes. Not sure, but don't think so. I have been under enormous stress for a couple years. My husband passed away in June this year and we scattered his ashes just last Saturday. So I suspect all the crying and anxiety is affecting me in a lot of ways. I do eat crackers at night. Have done this for a long time. Need to find a different snack I guess. Yesterday I took a Librax for stomach issues. Most meds stay in my system for a long time and cause some dizziness. The MS has been blamed for almost everything over the years, but I often have my doubts. I tend to overthink everything. I don't eat regular meals. I eat when I can or when I feel hungry. Sometimes I pick all day long. So I'm not sure when to test. I went thru all this with my husband. He was frequently low in the morning and had terrible symptoms. When his b/s was high he didn't seem to have any symptoms. Very confusing disease. I also went back and checked my lab records for a couple years. The Glucose was always normal... even last summer. Thank you for the help. Post Edited (ozarker) : 11/12/2018 8:58:22 AM (GMT-7). Posted 11/12/2018 10:21 AM (GMT -7). I'm sorry for the loss of your husband. I'm sure you were going through a lot of stress (and probably still are). I hope you have been doing better lately and have some good support from family and your doctors. For your blood sugar, as I wrote, a journal is best so you can see what's going on. And this is something you can show your doctor if necessary, too. Since you are ""grazing"" rather than eating an entire meal at one time, just take your blood sugar and write the time and results. Then, eat something that you normally would at that time, and then test about 2 hours later, even 1 1/2 hours later and write the results down. The difference in readings will tell you how you metabolized what you ate or drank. Also, take your blood sugar as soon as you wake up before you eat or drink anything. Fasting blood sugar does tell you and the doctor a lot about your blood sugar health. Then, don't stress about this. If you don't have anyone in the family with diabetes (maybe this is something you need to ask about , too), then this is good news because very very often, blood sugar problems run in the family. If you are overweight, this also contributes to higher blood sugar the same as not being active physically. As we get older (I know this because I'm 69.) we are often less active for various reasons, so if this is the case, it also contributes to higher blood sugar. You can read the stickies at the top of the Diabetes Forum and the link in my signature for more information. As for the Librax, it might be why you have some dizziness. If this is more than just passing, please speak to your doctor or the pharmacist. There might be some ways to change it or how you take it. Here is a link that explains this medication: https://www.rxlist.com/librax-side-effects-drug-center.htm#overview. I'm glad you posted! Where are you in the Ozarks? I'm outside of Memphis. Posted 11/12/2018 10:54 AM (GMT -7). Thanks again. I am about 100 lbs, 68 years old. The MS does bring on constant dizziness and fatigue. So my neuro has been watching this for years. But, sometimes I just want to dig around and find an answer myself. I'm not very active either. Have a lot of pain at times and am too exhausted to do much. I do try to walk around, from one end of the house to the other a lot. You are right about the stress. I took care of Sam for a couple years, then it gradually became more and more difficult. I was sick, and he was progressing to the point where he needed more help. The last 2 months we had Hospice, then a caregiver, then he was gone. I watched him take his last breath in our home. I'm having a terrible time with this. My kids are good to help me when they can. It was a terrible thing to endure. I am in Marshfield Mo. Near Springfield. And I have been to Memphis. Getting snow right now.. first time this year. Getting ready to go test. I hope I'm doing this right. I did it for Sam many times, but this is a new unit... a cheap one... Diagnosed with MS 2001. Posted 11/12/2018 11:00 AM (GMT -7). Now I can go eat something. Earlier I had peanut butter on bread and tea with honey. My meter registers the readings. Posted 11/12/2018 1:10 PM (GMT -7). By the way... what is the 2 hour delay between eating and testing all about ? Does it take 2 hours to digest food? Posted 11/12/2018 1:40 PM (GMT -7). No, it's not about digestion. I think it's compared to the 'normal' time that non-diabetics can metabolize food/drink. It's basically comparing how our results are in relation to a non-diabetic's. I think digestion actually begins in the mouth when the saliva mixes with the food (if I remember my high school science class correctly). Some food affects our blood sugar way more than others. Anything made with flour or sugar (or honey, maple syrup...), rice, grains like corn, potatoes, beans will make our blood sugar rise fast and high, but something like a piece of steak or chicken or fish will not. So, these guidelines that we're given by the doctors are really telling us what level we should be at and what level we shouldn't be at. All this is compared to people who don't have diabetes. But it's not that simple. Having the elevated reading you had before would mean you don't metabolize the carbs in food and drink as a non-diabetic would. A non-diabetic's blood sugar would rarely spike that high. Another thing that doctors look at is how long it takes for our blood sugar to come back down to normal after eating. The longer it takes, the more problems the doctor sees for our blood sugar ""recovery"". Your 115 after eating the peanut butter on bread and having tea with honey shows that you didn't spike very high as you did before. Peanut butter (the natural kind, not the kind with added sugar) is great to eat and snack on. And of course the bread is a carb but some factors may determine how many carbs are in that bread: how big the slice is, the ingredients of the bread, how many slices you eat. Honey is pure sugar. I think being aware of this is good but not obsessive. If it makes you eat more vegetables, then this is a good thing! Colorful vegetables like different bell peppers, leafy greens, mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, cauliflower, eggplant, zucchini, radishes, green beans are all nutritious and filling and better for our blood sugar than potatoes. Posted 11/12/2018 3:03 PM (GMT -7). So after all this do you think I have Diabetes? I really don't think so, but I do have a bunch of other problems gumming up the works. I will see my primary about this and get things checked. Sorry to sound so stupid but I really never learned much about nutrition and don't know anything about metabolizing. I always thought honey was good for us. I've had tea with honey for a few years now. I honestly hope I don't have to start learning all about this now. My husband took care of his own insulin etc until the last weeks of his life. By then, Hospice took him off all meds anyway. Posted 11/12/2018 6:44 PM (GMT -7). ""Metabolizing"" means how our bodies process our food, how it breaks it down into useful nutrients and uses them and how our bodies create waste from the food we eat. So when we eat a meal, our bodies break down the food into what's useful for us and what's not. To get a lot of natural vitamins and minerals, we need to eat lots of fresh (or even frozen) vegetables. Fruit has the same nutrients as vegetables but it also has fructose, a sugar that makes most fruit sweet. The best you can do for yourself is keep a journal of your blood sugar as I described and the next time you see your doctor, show it to him or her. And check out the link in my signature if you want to do some reading about blood sugar. But please don't stress yourself out over this. You've been through a lot both emotionally and physically to this point and worrying will make you feel worse. I suggest you eat wholesome, fresh food to keep yourself healthy in the meantime. I hope the weather isn't too bad in Marshfield. We're in the low 40's here and looking at the 20's and 30's overnight. Posted 11/13/2018 7:07 AM (GMT -7). Thank you so much. I tested first thing this morning, before even getting out of bed. 93 score. We got our first snow yesterday. It's down in the teens with a wind chill of 4 degrees. But I don't mind the cold so much. It's the ice I hate!! I've fallen off the road too many times on black ice. So now I don't even attempt to go out. I've been reading a lot about blood sugar. Our bodies are so complicated. I knew a little about this with Sam, but really he took care of it himself until the last few weeks of his life. By that time it wasn't necessary to even give insulin anymore. Yes, I've been thru a lot. I am crying as I type this. Everything turns on the tears, anytime, anywhere, any circumstance. I feel like I will never stop. 45 years together. Three kids together. One grandchild. We just scattered his ashes last Saturday... his request for the opening day of deer season. My poor son was beside himself. He took his Dad with him that morning for his last hunt... again, his request. Thanks for your patience and all your help. Posted 11/13/2018 9:22 AM (GMT -7). I'm sure this has been a hard road for you and I'm glad you have your kids to help you get through this - and don't forget that you're a great help for them, too! This kind of weather here brings ice more than snow and it's so much more dangerous for driving. It just seems they can't treat the roads here on time. Take care of yourself and your health. The best you can do for yourself is to learn as much as you can about what's going on. When you see your doctor and get any lab tests done, make sure you get copies of the lab results and keep them in a special file. Have a great day and post any questions that you have or if you need to talk!

LONDONDERRY, N.H. - Nov. 10, 2018 - -- Since it's inception five years ago, the MS5000 has raised over $125,000 for charity organizations that benefit MS patients and their families. This year, 57 riders from all over the United States rode their motorcycles as many miles as they could over 50 days while soliciting donations from their family and friends. From September 1st through October 20th, they documented their miles, gaining one point for every mile and ten points for every dollar they raised. The winner gets a trophy and bragging rights, and for 2018, Luke Rutledge from Missouri won by riding 6762 miles and raising a whopping $3374 dollars! 100% of the proceeds went to MS Views and News, Inc., and their Ride to Reach Rural America initiative. ""It is really incredible, to see these men and women dedicate so many hours and miles to help us deliver education, inspiration and hope to so many families struggling with MS in remote areas of the country,"" said Stuart Schlossman, the President of MS Views and News. The MS5000 motorcycle challenge is organized by Longhaulpaul (Paul Pelland) who despite having MS himself, is 340,000 miles into his million mile journey Chasing the Cure for Multiple Sclerosis.

Every time that I went without steroids, my symptoms just continued to worsen. For me, I was often on a large 5-day dose, followed by a 12-day taper. Symptoms of my flare often didn't begin to improve until after the taper was over; it was hard to be patient. I have been in the same boat as you last time I had my Ivig infusion the Dr also gave me a dose of steroids one time and I was doing a little bit better the next day but everything came back again and it hasn't really improved much at all. Now when I'd be in the hospital for 3-4 days and got the steroids and a tapper pack I'd be ok anywhere from 2-3 months and better but not much. As to my health it's declined quite a bit more the last year I've gone way down hill as to the way I've been feeling. And yes I'm still looking for a maricle cure but I don't know if I'll ever find it. Best wishes and I hope that you start to feel better soon. 	1	1	MS|Exacerbation	Originally|Posted|by|Mamabug|.|In|my|case|,|steroids|always|did|change|the|course|of|my|flares|.|Every|time|that|I|went|without|steroids|,|my|symptoms|just|continued|to|worsen|.|For|me|,|I|was|often|on|a|large|5|-|day|dose|,|followed|by|a|12|-|day|taper|.|Symptoms|of|my|flare|often|didn't|begin|to|improve|until|after|the|taper|was|over|;|it|was|hard|to|be|patient|.|I|have|been|in|the|same|boat|as|you|last|time|I|had|my|Ivig|infusion|the|Dr|also|gave|me|a|dose|of|steroids|one|time|and|I|was|doing|a|little|bit|better|the|next|day|but|everything|came|back|again|and|it|hasn't|really|improved|much|at|all|.|Now|when|I'd|be|in|the|hospital|for|3-4|days|and|got|the|steroids|and|a|tapper|pack|I'd|be|ok|anywhere|from|2-3|months|and|better|but|not|much|.|As|to|my|health|it's|declined|quite|a|bit|more|the|last|year|I've|gone|way|down|hill|as|to|the|way|I've|been|feeling|.|And|yes|I'm|still|looking|for|a|maricle|cure|but|I|don't|know|if|I'll|ever|find|it|.|Best|wishes|and|I|hope|that|you|start|to|feel|better|soon|.

For many people, the word ""meditation"" calls up images of alternative lifestyles or non-Western traditions. However, public perception of meditation has started to shift in recent years due to the scientific community's growing interest in the topic. There’s still no conclusive proof that meditation makes a measurable, biochemical change in the body or the mind. But some psychologists have proposed that this form of relaxation may help people, including those with multiple sclerosis (MS), reach a calmer state of mind. And this could help reduce the impact of stress. Many paths to calm. There are many ways to meditate. Just keep an open mind and see which type of meditation works best for you. Before you begin a meditation session, talk to your doctor, select a quiet place, dress comfortably, and find a comfortable place to sit. Common meditation techniques include:. A practice of focusing exclusively on your breath. The goal of visualization is to shift your thoughts away from everyday concerns to an imaginary world of your own choosing. :::::::.

Hello everybody, thank you for joining our webinar on flow cytometry. We appreciate your time and hope it's not too inconvenient for you. As Lucy said, in the next hour or so we would like to give you an introduction to this exciting technique. First, I would like to start off with an overview: how flow cytometry can be used, including the basic protocols. Then I will briefly explain the science behind the exposition of data, and finish with the analysis of the results and potential troubleshooting. So for those of you who are not familiar with flow cytometry, what is it? Flow cytometry is a powerful technique that is used to study individual cells or particles in heterogeneous populations. It allows you to measure multiple parameters rapidly and simultaneously. Furthermore, cells can be separated using a cell sorter. This subdiscipline of flow cytometry is often referred to as fluorescence activated cell sorting, or in short FACS. Due to its versatility, flow cytometry is widely used in basic and clinical research. The research areas which flow cytometry is used include the investigation of certain cell surface markers, as well as intracellular markers or fluorescent proteins, for example. It also is used in the analysis of the DNA content of a cell and much, much more as you can see from this list. I don't want to read the whole list to you, but would rather like to give you a flavor of what can be done with flow cytometry. Flow cytometry evolved from the analysis of blood cells in leukemia patients, and today it is still used to phenotype cells of the immune system in various experimental settings, such as vaccination studies. Flow cytometry can also be used to characterize cancer cells from a solid tumor, and tumor cells that are maybe circulating in the body. The cells that can be analyzed with flow cytometry it can go from very small like bacteria, up to very large, or even whole organisms. Amazingly, flow cytometry is indeed used to study certain mutants of C. elegans. In these studies, the whole worm is flushed through the flow cytometer in order to check for expression of the marker of interest. Because flow cytometry is such a powerful technique, it has been and is being used more and more. This is illustrated in this graph, which shows the number of publications mentioning flow cytometry or FACS over the last 35 years, and you can see the number is steadily increasing. But how do you actually utilize flow cytometry? Flow cytometry is a three-step process of: (A) a proper sample preparation; (B) the preparation of the instrument, followed by (C) the data analysis step. Today, I would like to point out what is most important for each of these steps. This means I will talk about the sample preparation and the staining protocols. I will speak about how to set up the instrument, including the compensation process and which controls are required, and I will briefly mention how data is usually analyzed and displayed. For flow cytometry it is imperative that you prepare a single cell suspension, and this is because so-called doublets, cell clumps or dead cells in your sample can generate misleading data. In case you are analyzing blood samples, which basically is already a single cell suspension, the blood should be collected in tubes that support your experimental setting. For immunophenotyping, for example, collection tubes with EDTA or citrate as an anticoagulant are recommended. Here I suggest to check with the manufacturer of the collection tube for more details. You also may want to consider the lysis of the red blood cells. If you're analyzing cell culture cells or tissue samples, you can use enzymatic methods or a tissue homogenizer to prepare the single cell suspension. In general, it is useful to filter all samples using a 50 µm nylon mesh. Also, to reduce unspecific signals or staining due to dead cells, it is always advisable to ensure viability of the cells you're investigating. The next step is staining of the cells or particles. As for most procedures there are direct and indirect staining protocols, as well as a protocol for staining intracellular proteins. I would like to start off with the direct staining protocol. As mentioned earlier, to ensure viability of the cells it is recommended to keep the cells on ice during the preparation and staining of the procedure. A typical sample contains 105 to 106 cells, which are usually resuspended in a volume of 100 µl in a tube or a round-bottom plate. Depending on the sample preparation procedure, the cells should be washed and this is usually done using a buffer-like PBS that includes serum of BSA. Then you spin down the cells and remove the supernatant. The next step is a blocking step. As for many other protocols, this can be done by adding a buffer with 1-10% serum of BSA to the cell palette. To improve the blocking, the blocking reagent can also be included in the dilution buffer of the primary antibody, which in most cases might be sufficient. Again, this step is followed by washing and centrifuging the cells. The third step is incubating the cell palette with the primary antibody. The optimum concentration of the antibody will need to be determined by titration. The aim with this is to obtain the maximum contrast between the specific signal, and the background staining. In this direct staining protocol, the primary antibody is fluorochrome conjugated. The most frequently used fluorochromes are the fluorescein-based dye FITC, and phycoerythrin or PE; but, as you can see, there are many, many more available. In general, the sample is incubated for 15-45 min at 4 °C, and in order to protect the fluorochrome from photobleaching in the dark. The following step, the fixation is an optional step, as there are many pros and cons for the fixation of cells. An advantage is the prevention of infection, for example, with contagious diseases from patients whose blood samples are investigated. Fixation can also be convenient as fixed samples need not be analyzed immediately after staining, but can be stored for some time in the fridge, for example. The disadvantage of fixing your cells though is that you cannot exclude dead cells, as the fixation process kills virtually all cells. Fixation also alters the light-scatter profiles and may increase the autofluorescence, so you might need to adjust the instrument settings. If you decide to go ahead and fix the cells, you can either use alcohol such as ethanol or methanol. These reagents can work for most protein antigens, certainly they are the fixation reagent of choice for DNA measurements. You could alternatively perform fixation with formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde, although this is a cross-linking fixative it generally works well with most antigens. Finally, before running the sample on the flow cytometer, it needs to be resuspended in a minimum of 250 µl of buffer, depending on the type of assay you're performing or the machine you have available. To avoid fading of the fluorescence, keep the stained cells in the dark stored at 4 °C and analyze as soon as possible. Also, remember to vortex the sample immediately before the run to ensure an evenly mixed single cell suspension. Now, this was the direct staining protocol for flow cytometry; now I would like to briefly talk you through the indirect staining protocol. This protocol starts off with the same steps as the direct protocol, so first you would prepare your single cell suspension, and secondly comes the blocking of the samples, if required. The third step is, again, incubation with the primary antibody. In contrast to the direct staining protocol, the primary antibody in this case is not labelled with the fluorochrome. It may be conjugated to biotin though, as illustrated in these pictures. Following a washing step, the palette is then incubated with a secondary antibody. This is the antibody which is labelled with the fluorochrome, such as FITC or PE. If you have used a biotin-conjugated primary, you would need to incubate with the fluorochrome-conjugated avidin, or streptavidin. The following steps are as before: after washing is an optional fixation step, before running the sample on the flow cytometer. Different to the direct and indirect staining protocol is the intracellular staining. In order to make intracellular proteins accessible for the antibody, a fixation and permeabilization step is required. For this, either a membrane solubilizer such as saponin or digitonin can be used. As these induce a reversible permeabilization, they should be added to the dilution buffers which are subsequently used to maintain the permeabilization of the cell. Alternatively, detergents such as Triton or Tween can be used, and these induce an irreversible permeabilization. If you would like to analyze any kind of cell surface marker in combination with an intracellular staining, we would recommend to perform the third surface staining prior to the fixation and permeabilization steps. When performing this step, please keep in mind that the light-scatter profiles can change considerably and you may need to adjust the instrument settings accordingly. We now have prepared our precious samples - what comes next? The next step is to set up the flow cytometer. For those of you who are not familiar with the technique, the flow cytometer does not come ready-to-use out of the box. It is the type of your sample, actually, that dictates which setting to use. It's really a very important step, because you don't want to waste your precious samples just because the settings were incorrect. What kind of settings are these? What kind of measurements or parameters are required with the flow cytometer? Generally, there are two types of properties measured: first, there are the structural properties. These include the size of the cell and its cytoplasmic granularity or complexity, as it is often known. In order to measure these properties, no reagents or probes are required. On the other hand, properties which are related to the function of a cell can be measured. These properties include the expression of cell surface or intracellular marker, or the periodic flux of calcium. It also includes the RNA or DNA content of a certain cell. In order to measure these properties, reagents or probes are required and that's why we stained our samples with a fluorochrome labelled antibody. How exactly are these properties measured? How does the flow cytometer actually work? The great advantage of a flow cytometer is that it analyzes one cell at a time. As the name 'flow cytometer' indicates, there is a constant flow of a so-called sheath fluid. Into this flow the sample is injected, in this case coming here from the top. A process called hydrodynamic focusing occurs, which ensures that the cells are passed through the flow cell in single file, as indicated down here. Each cell in turn enters a laser beam, coming here from the side, and two signals are generated. One signal is the fluorescence that is emitted from the stain cells; this signal is passed on to the fluorescent detectors. The other signal is the forward and side scattered lights coming from all cells. This signal is passed on to the scatter detectors. What do these different signals actually tell us? First, to the forward and side scatter. As mentioned before, as the cell enters the laser beam light is scattered in different directions, as can be seen here in this schematic, the beam coming from the bottom hitting the cell, and the light is scattered. This can be collected and measured to give information on cell characteristics. To be more specific, the direction of forward scattered light correlates to the cell size; the direction of side scattered light correlates to the granularity or complexity of a cell. Please remember to collect the correct signals, please keep in mind that the sample type dictates which settings to use on your flow cytometer. So far to the dry theory, how does that actually look like with a real sample? Using this information on the physical or structural properties of the cell that is based on the forward scatter and side scatter readings. Cell populations can be distinguished from each other due to different size and complexity characteristics. The results are typically displayed as a dot plot, as for this scatter profile of a human blood sample. So here we have on the X axis, usually the forward scatter that is the cell size. On the Y axis it's usually the side scatter relating to the complexity of the cell. Each single dot represents an event that has been analyzed, and in this example these cells seem to cluster in three different populations. A population of relatively small cells with little granularity here in the bottom left corner in green, and two populations of cells with a similar size here in red and in blue. The cells in the blue population seem to have a higher intracellular complexity compared to the red population. Detailed analysis showed that these three populations represent different blood cell types. The green population are rather small lymphocytes, whereas the red and blue populations are monocytes and neutrophils, respectively. So this can help us to distinguish different cell populations from each other, but what can you do when you analyze cells of a similar size or complexity? So if you're interested in the expression of a certain protein in a subpopulation of your culture, then you would stain your cells with a fluorescent dye. This raises the question: what is fluorescence? Fluorescence is the emission of light by a fluorochrome that has absorbed light of a different, to be precise, shorter wavelength. Light consists of different wavelengths, as can be seen in this diagram, blue light has a shorter wavelength as red light, some 400 nm compared to 700 nm. You can observe these different wavelengths of light every time we see a rainbow. The individual flow force of fluorochromes that we use in our experiments have unique and characteristic spectra for the absorption of light, and emission of light. Important to know for each fluorochrome is first the excitation wavelength. This is a signature wavelength at which the molecule is excited by the force of light. Second, the emission wavelength, and this is a signature wavelength at which the fluorochrome emits a photon. So in this example for phycoerythrin, the molecule is excited by the blue laser at 488 nm, as indicated by this white line over here. This is close to one of the excitation maxima indicated by the dashed line, and the solid line shows that PE emits light at a wavelength of 578 nm, as indicated by the peak of this solid line over here. As mentioned before, there's a huge variety of fluorochromes available. In general, they are of two different natures, they are either synthetic organic dyes such as FITC, the DyLight family, the Cy dyes, or the Alexa Fluor family, or they are fluorescent proteins such as PE, APC, or GFP. How are all these fluorescent signals detected in a flow cytometer? This is where I have to go just a little bit into the technical details of a flow cytometer. So this is the setup of a standard four-color flow cytometer. If you remember, earlier I showed you the flow cell and the fluidic system through which the sample is passed here in the bottom left corner, and the laser beam coming from the side over here. The scattered light and fluorescent signals, which are generated here are then split into defined wavelengths and channeled by an array of filters and mirrors, in short the optics. Individual fluorescence is then picked up by so-called photomultiplier tubes or PMTs, and is then, in turn, converted into, in most cases, a digital signal. These are the data which are analyzed on the computer with post-acquisition software. However, when you have used the flow cytometer already, you may know that this is not all. As mentioned before, the sample type dictates the settings of the flow cytometer. This is particularly true when using more than one fluorescence. During the analysis of data from two fluorochromes, you need to compensate for an overlap of the emission spectra of two fluorochromes; the process, which is called compensation. Let me explain this with the most frequently used fluorochromes: FITC and PE. So this is a very detailed image, but I will talk you through it. For the moment we can only focus on the solid line, which are the emission profiles. You can see that FITC has got an emission maximum at 520 nm, but it also emits light up to a wavelength of 650 nm, as shown by this tail over here. In contrast, you can see that PE has got an emission maximum at 578 nm, as indicated by this peak here. If you now detect the signals for PE between, let's say, 550 and 620 nm that is around the emission maximum of the PE. You not only detect the signal for PE, but you also obtain a signal that comes from the PE over here, in this range of the wavelength. Therefore, you need to compensate for this so-called spillover by subtracting the fluorescent signal, in this case the FITC, that has leaked into the wrong detector, in this case the PE detector. As there is a huge number of different flow cytometers available and we cannot cover all the details of every machine here, I would like to refer you to the manufacturer's instructions for details. In order to perform this compensation and also to setup the instrument properly, a number of controls is required. For example, an unstained or negative control is used to determine background staining or autofluorescence, and to setup the instrument. Controls state with only one of the fluorochromes used are required for compensation. Just like for other applications, isotype controls, no-primary controls and positive controls are used to confirm specific binding, and to exclude non-specific binding of the antibodies used. You may find more detailed information of the required controls on our website, and other relevant sources. So having prepared our samples properly and setup a flow cytometer appropriately, the final step, the data analysis should be a piece of cake! Data analysis is facilitated by a huge variety of post-acquisition software that are currently available, and which enables you to display the data in many ways. Most commonly, flow cytometric data is presented as a dot plot. Variations of this kind of plot are the control plot or the pseudocolor plot, as can be seen in the following example. Here we have the results of a staining for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in human blood, using our antibodies ab86886 and ab86891. On the X axis the fluorescence intensity for FITC, in this case, labeling the CD4+ T cells is shown. Whereas on the Y axis the intensity for PE, labeling the CD8+ T cells is indicated. In this plot there are four more or less distinct cell populations, in the lower left is a population of cells that reveal little or no green or red fluorescence; these are the CD4 and CD8 negative cells. Along the X axis there's a population of cells that exhibit an increased green, but no red fluorescence; these are the CD4+ T cells. Accordingly, along the Y axis there's a population of cells that exhibit an increased red, but no green fluorescence; these are the CD8+ T cells. Finally, there's a small population of cells that seems to reveal both green and red fluorescence, which correlates to cells expressing both the CD4 and the CD8 molecule. Flow cytometric data can also be displayed as a histogram, as in this example here. For a histogram the fluorescence intensity, so, for example, the FITC is plotted against the number of cells that are exhibiting the staining, resulting in this curve-like structure. This kind of display is predominantly used for cell cycle analysis. For cell cycle analysis the measurement of DNA is widely used, and histograms allow you to determine the DNA content of a cell that is whether it is haploid or diploid. This kind of assay gives you information about the action of cytotoxic drugs, it also allows the characterization of cells such as cancer cells, which are often aneuploid. For those of you who are interested in a certain cell population to subculture it, or to use it for subsequent PCA or microarray analysis, a final word to the subdiscipline of cell sorting. How does this work? So the main difference to an analyzing flow cytometer, which I've tried to explain before, is that individual cells or particles are contained in a droplet of sheath fluid once they have past the laser beam. So, here again, we have got samples coming from the top, entering the laser beam and then being in individual droplets. This droplet is given an electronic charge and is in turn attracted or repelled by the deflection plates, and sorted into appropriate collection tubes down here. Nowadays, most cell sorters can sort up to four populations simultaneously, and this sorting is more specific than magnetic beads. To keep it short, the take-home message for cell sorting is if you can see it on an analyzer, you can sort it on a sorter. So far so good, but what can you do when the results are not satisfactory? Typically, poor results are of two kinds, either you obtain no signal at all or there is a high background staining. No signal indicates a need to optimize the protocol or the defective antibody, or a lack of the target in the sample. When you observe this, check if your antibody is specific for the species you are investigating. You could also titrate the antibody again, as you may need to increase the concentration. We would also recommend using other techniques to confirm the presence of your target. The problem of a high background staining might be resolved by reducing the antibody concentration, or you could block non-specific interactions of the antibodies with serum or BSA. In order to isolate this problem, isotype controls or no-primary controls can be very helpful. So I hope I could show you today that flow cytometry is a very powerful technique that continues to evolve rapidly with the development of new fluorochromes and dyes, as well as novel flow cytometers. If you would like to gain more information, I can recommend consulting your local, regional or national flow cytometry society, the web, for example, Abcam's website for more detailed information on protocols, or, if you prefer, a number of books and journals that are out there. Thank you so much for your attention, and thank you also for the questions that you have already sent in. If you have any more questions, please feel free to type them in the Q&A panel on the right hand side of your screen. I will try to answer them in a few moments, but first I would like to hand you over to Augustine. AM: Thank you, Ina. Hello, my name is Augustine and I'm one of the product managers here at Abcam. I'm going to give you a quick summary of some of the products Abcam offers that can help you with your flow cytometry experiments. Before I introduce these products to you, I'd like to mention that at the bottom of the presentation slides you will find links to resources on our website, where you can find out more information about these products. The first product I would like to introduce to you is our multi-color B and T cell marker panels. These are comprised of monoclonal antibodies directly conjugated to a spectrum of fluorophores. They can be used with a wide variety of instruments, and are useful for multicolor characterizations. The fantastic thing about these products is that they're a great and convenient starter kit if you're new to flow cytometry, as the antibodies have already been optimized for flow cytometry and you get everything in one nice, tidy and convenient package. The next product I'd like to introduce to you is our EasyLink antibody conjugation kits. These are a vital tool for direct staining where you cannot find a conjugated primary antibody, which you require for an experiment. EasyLink kits are great and with a hands-on time of only 30 sec. They allow you to rapidly conjugate your antibody to your label of choice, and are a cost-effective solution to having the primary antibody you need for your experiment. Abcam offers a variety of fluorescent conjugates relevant to flow cytometry. However, we have other conjugates avidin and biotin available for other types of experiments as well. One thing to know with antibody conjugation is that it is dependent on the purity and concentration of your antibody sample. We also offer purification and concentration kits to help with optimizing your antibody samples for use in flow cytometry. If you plan to do a one-off experiment and don't have a directly labelled primary, or it's not cost-effective for you to use a conjugation kit, we would also recommend one of our secondary antibodies. Abcam has over 2,500 secondary antibodies in our catalogue. For flow cytometry we would recommend our pre-adsorbed range, and if you're using Fc receptor-rich samples, we also offer a large selection of F(ab')2 fragments. An additional benefit of using one of our secondary antibodies is that you may find conjugates available in the secondary range, which may not be available with the EasyLink. At the moment, you can also take advantage of a special offer which we are running, where if you place a secondary antibody purchase before the 31st October 2011, you can also receive our free IHC Methods Express book. Abcam's catalogue also includes a range of small molecule or the biological dyes, which include DRAQ5, Cytrak Orange and DRAQ7. DRAQ5 is a far-red fluorescent dye with applications in cell cycle analysis, as Ina mentioned earlier. The dye only labels double-stranded DNA eliminating the need for using RNAs, which could shorten your experiment and save you a lot of time. Cytrak Orange is an orange fluorescent dye with dual staining, and can be used as a live cell gate in nucleated cells, and for detecting rare events. DRAQ7 is a far-red dye, which labels permeabilized cells which makes it useful for dead, apoptotic cell exclusion as a viability gate. All these dyes are compatible with a variety of flow cytometry systems, and they also offer the advantage of having very low photobleaching. The majority of the dyes are also compatible with FITC and PE. As I mentioned, there's further resources available for all of these products on our website, and you can find the links to these at the bottom of these slides in this presentation. As a little thank you for attending this webinar, we'd also like to offer you a special promotion where you can get 25% off the following products: any product in the EasyLink antibody conjugation kit range, any product in our Annexin V assay kit range, DRAQ5, DRAQ7 and Cytrak Orange. If you'd like to take advantage of this promotion, please email us. You can also benefit from a further 25% off in the future, if you send us back data from the initial promotion for any of the products that you may have used. To find out further details about this promotion, please visit our website. Before I hand back to Ina for your troubleshooting questions, I'd like to thank you for your time and to wish you a pleasant day. IS: Thank you, Augustine. Hello again and a big thank you to all the participants who have submitted questions during the presentation, and we've received really a lot of questions so far. I will try to go through a few of them now. The first question we had by Sandra, and she wanted to know: How should I perform the lysis of red blood cells? Well, the lysis is usually done using a buffer with ammonium chloride, and this leads to basically the swelling or the bursting of the erythrocytes and thereby you can get rid of them. I would recommend to prepare this buffer freshly, and take care not to treat the cells for too long, as other cell types can be affected as well. Personally, I made the experience that reagents used for fixation or permeabilization also lead to the lysis of erythrocytes and can thereby also be used. We've got a question - quite interesting - from Richard; Richard asks: Can I use flow cytometry for the detection of proteins that are secreted? Of course, Richard, you can; I did it myself. As I said earlier, flow cytometry has evolved or is frequently used in the immunophenotyping, and immune cells often secrete cytokines and you can measure these by treating the cells with a reagent that prevents the secretion of the cytokines, so the proteins of interest. Usually brefeldin A or monensin is used for this, and these are so-called Golgi blocks and, or brefeldin is Golgi block, and that leads to the accumulation of the protein inside the endoplasmic reticulum, and with this you then can perform an intracellular staining to detect the protein of interest. I think I'll pick the question from Michelle; Michelle wants to know: I am using DyLight 488 and PE for my protein of interest, can I include DRAQ7 to gate for the live cells? Yes, Michelle, that is a very good choice, actually, as Augustine just pointed out, DRAQ7 stains the double-stranded DNA of dead cells, so you can use it to gate on live as well as dead cells in flow cytometry. The emission maximum is in the far-red for DRAQ5, so somewhere beyond 650 nanometers, and therefore it is compatible with the 488 in the green range and the PE in the yellowish light, if you like. This is more or less a troubleshooting - Rachel has a problem: I did an intracellular staining and obtained a high background staining, what can I do? Well, that somewhat depends a little bit on your protocol, what you have done already. In general, you can try to wash the sample again, that may help already to reduce the background staining. You could also include a blocking reagent, such as serum of BSA into your wash buffer, or also into the dilution buffer of the antibodies to reduce the background staining. It depends on the dye that you have used, so for intracellular staining I would not recommend to use tandem dyes or large proteins, as they probably cannot enter the cell and may give an unspecific staining. We have a question by Molly; Molly wants to know: My protein is not abundantly expressed in the cells I'm investigating, which dyes would you recommend? That is a rather short answer, so for rare targets, so proteins that are not highly expressed in your cells, I would always recommend to use bright dyes such as PE or APC to make the signal stand out. Then we have Derek: How long can I store my samples before running them on the flow cytometer? So this is a question of practical relevance. In general, I would suggest to analyze the samples as soon as possible, so the sooner the better. For unfixed cells it would be definitely within 24 hr also for fixed samples. If you're performing DNA measurements that could be stained, stored longer up to several days, I would say. Maybe also a little bit depending on the dye that you have used. Then we have Jan; Jan wants to know: Can I use flow cytometry to determine the absolute size of cells? Not really, so flow cytometry is powerful, but unfortunately it does not give you the real size of the cells in µm, for example. So you may refer to a scatter plot, but I've shown you earlier and there you could see that the forward scatter or the signal that is given by the forward scatter is given in arbitrary measurements, so it's not really related to the actual size of a cell. A final question. Mark wants to know: How can I study apoptosis? So I think there are many ways, because this is such a complex process you could use flow cytometry to detect the light scatter or the changes in light scatter profiles of the cell that are undergoing apoptosis, so they change their sizes and contents. You could check for the DNA content of the cell using DNA dyes such as, for example, DRAQ5, as Gus just mentioned. Or you could perform an Annexin V staining, which is specific for cells undergoing apoptosis. So I think you could use a bunch of approaches to analyze this with flow cytometry. I think we are approaching the end of our webinar. Unfortunately, I cannot go through all the questions you had today, but for those of you whose questions I have not mentioned I will be contacting you within the next few days. So from me it's a danke schoën and auf wiedersehen, and I will now pass you back to Lucy who will provide some final webinar details, including where you can download the presentation I've just given.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Wednesday October 31 2018 03:50 PM. Following on from the success of the MSunderstood Café back in March of this year, we are delighted to announce that we will be bringing the MSunderstood Café in the form of a bus to various locations around the country! Check the schedule below to see where it is coming to near you! In case you missed out on the café in March, to give you an idea of what it involves you can watch the video here as to how this experiential café gave people a glimpse as to what it is like living with MS. The Café has been adapted on a specifically designed bus to provide people with a unique insight into what it is like to live with MS and some of the challenges they may face on a daily basis. MS Ireland hopes the MSunderstood Café Roadshow will build on the support created by the Café in March and highlight the urgent need for improved access to medicine and treatment for the management of MS. In recent years there has been significant improvement in medicine and treatment, however unlike other EU countries, the Irish market access system means people with MS here face significant delays. To discover more about the Patients Deserve Better campaign you can take action here. We hope you are able to attend the Café on the day and please feel free to tell you friends, family and colleagues to come along! All proceeds raised on the bus will go towards MS Ireland.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4688408979125183571/Stroke-'mimics'-and-'chameleons'-can-complicate-accurate-diagnoses	Stroke 'mimics' and 'chameleons' can complicate accurate diagnoses	"Reviewed by Alina Shrourou, BSc Oct 26 2018. Stroke specialists often see conditions known as stroke ""mimics"" and ""chameleons"" that can complicate accurate diagnoses, Loyola Medicine neurologists report in the November 2018 issue of Neuroimaging Clinics of North America . Stroke mimics are medical conditions that look like strokes, while chameleons are strokes that look like other conditions. Diagnostic accuracy ""may be complicated by the abundance of both 'stroke mimics' and 'stroke chameleons,'"" neurologists Shannon Hextrum, MD, and José Biller, MD, wrote. Dr. Biller is professor and chair of the department of neurology of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. Dr. Hextrum completed a neurology residency at Loyola. Biller and Hextrum examined mimics and chameleons associated with ischemic strokes, which account for about 85 percent of all strokes. Ischemic strokes are caused by blood clots that block blood flow to an area of the brain. (The other main type of stroke, hemorrhagic, is caused by bleeding in the brain.). Permanent damage from an ischemic stroke can be minimized by quickly restoring blood flow. This can be done by administering the clot-busting IV drug tPA or by performing a minimally invasive surgery to remove the blood clot. But such treatments can do more harm than good if a patient is incorrectly diagnosed. The exact prevalence of stroke mimics is unknown. According to previous studies, anywhere from 1.4 to 38 percent of patients admitted for suspected ischemic strokes actually have other conditions. For example, Drs. Hextrum and Biller cite the case of a 79-year-old woman who experienced sudden weakness on the right side of her body and difficulty speaking - classic signs of a stroke. But a CT angiogram showed no evidence of stroke, and she later was correctly diagnosed as having viral encephalitis. In another stroke mimic, a 60-year-old man had difficulty walking, speaking and reading. He also had vision problems that were preceded by a headache. The patient earlier had received radiation for a brain tumor. Rather than a stroke, he was experiencing SMART syndrome (stroke-like migraine attacks after radiation therapy). A wide range of other conditions also can mimic ischemic strokes, including seizures, sepsis, low blood sugar, dizziness, vertigo, drug and alcohol toxicity and multiple sclerosis. In treating an ischemic stroke, it's critically important to restore blood flow within the first few hours before brain cells die. But fewer than 10 percent of ischemic stroke patients receive a clot-busting drug and fewer still undergo surgery to remove the clot. One reason may be the prevalence of stroke chameleons. Stroke chameleons with non-specific symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and decreased mental activity, pose a particular challenge when triaging patients in the emergency room. But often, such patients also have neurologic deficits that can indicate a stroke. Accurately diagnosing an ischemic stroke requires a detailed history and neurologic examination, which should not be rushed in an effort to speed administration of the clot-busting drug, Drs. Hextrum and Biller wrote. They conclude: ""Attention to subtleties of the neurologic examination and listening closely to patients remain critical for both diagnostic accuracy and development of sound clinical judgment.""

I would suggest that they read up on this disease or attend a MS group and bring along that person. I have tried getting my son to read up on this but I think he’s having a tuff time with this. I’m bringing my husband to a group meeting one of these times because he’s getting tired of listening to me. It’s only because he doesn’t understand. He and I are separated but still live together but he actually suggested that he will go. Bringing other family members or friends that you trust may also help. I honestly think this is better than reading. Hearing others going through the same thing may make them understand better and will hopefully make friends with other caregivers. This is my goal and hope this works. He’s really not a social butterfly but I’m hoping he will reach out as well to others for support. This is my suggestion. Good luck! Oct 29, 2018 11:26 AM.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695027060354592740/Changing-Your-Perception---MS-Connection	Changing Your Perception - MS Connection	A few weeks ago, I went to a class called “Forget Your Fear & Trust Your Truth – A Personal Growth Workshop” held at Happier Valley Comedy in Hadley, MA by Pam Victor, and it empowered me to unleash my potential and stop holding myself back. Three hours at this workshop learning improvisation fundamentals has changed my perspective on life and MS. When we first got to the class, we were asked to choose an intention card, and I chose one that said, “Take risks.” I was taking this class because I wanted to challenge myself and to live outside of the safety bubble I had created. After we all introduced ourselves and stated our intentions, we split up into pairs and played our first improvisation game called 1, 2, 3. All we had to do was take turns saying 1, 2 and 3 and if either one of us messed up at all, we both had to raise our arms in the air and shout, “Yay!”. It sounds simple to say 1, 2, and 3 over and over again between the two of us; however, there were several times where I and/or my partner would forget where we were in the sequence, and we would have to raise our arms high in the air and shout “Yay!”. Ultimately, what we learned from this exercise is that it’s OK to mess up and not be perfect. We actually had more fun when we messed up because we got to celebrate and become much more accepting of ourselves in that moment. Although at first we were scared to make a mistake, we quickly realized that being scared was a belief and not a fact, and that we had the power within us to change our definition of failure and the power it had over our thoughts and actions. As we got through this first exercise, I started to realize that my feelings of being alone, having no control and not fitting in were all in my head. They were just fears and not facts at all. Instead of focusing on myself, my mobility issues and how I was being perceived by the other people participating in the class, I stayed in the moment and tried to live in a judgement free zone. The results were amazing. For the first time in a long time, I felt free from my negative thoughts and knew that I could achieve anything that I set out to accomplish. Since that class, I have given my first motivational speech, and I have started blogging again. Don’t get me wrong, I still have self-doubts, negative thoughts and fears; however, they have lost a lot of their power, and I am able to acknowledge them and move in a positive direction. So many of our fears regarding MS are exacerbated by our own unhelpful thoughts and judgments. The only facts we know for sure about MS is that it is unpredictable, and it’s a “disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and body.” That being said, everything else is a belief because all of our stories are different. Whereas, I have mobility issues, I know of other people with MS who are out there running marathons. We are all challenged with different symptoms, even though we share the same disease; none the less, we should never feel alone, out of control, or like we don’t fit in. We are all special.

I don't have a care partner but, I never did in fact. The end of a bad marriage is not a loss. For you to say that makes me so happy for you. I don't even know you and I'm still so proud of you for getting out and finding strength in it. I remember getting out of a relationship and feeling powerful in it. In fact, I cut all contact (we weren't married), told a loved one why, and we went out to a steak dinner because I felt I deserved it. Then, from the outside, I could better see the horror I'd escaped -- which was freaky but affirmming because I knew I held all the power now and I'd stopped all that. I'm glad that you got out, too, and that you understand. I always liked the Eagles, but now a song (though it's talking about high school love) provokes powerful, bittersweet tears. It's the third verse and chorus to ""Already Gone"":. Well I know it wasn't you who held me down. Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free. So often times it happens that we live our lives in chains. And we never even know we have the key. Like it says, wm, you're ""already gone and feeling strong"". I hope you can ""sing this victory song: woo-hoo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo!"" Hugs if you want them. It can be difficult, sure, but I'm so happy for you, that you're in such a better place now. Oct 23, 2018 6:53 PM. I'm sorry for what you went through. It is good that you were able to get away and that you had a nephew that was there for you.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693239879892267537/Xconomy:-Invenra,-Madison-Firm-Developing-Therapeutic-Antibodies,-Adds-7.1M	Xconomy: Invenra, Madison Firm Developing Therapeutic Antibodies, Adds $7.1M	Invenra, Madison Firm Developing Therapeutic Antibodies, Adds $7.1M. October 19th, 2018. * Like Us. Xconomy Wisconsin —. Invenra , a Madison, WI-based startup that develops therapeutic antibodies for pharmaceutical companies and other clients, has raised more than $7.1 million from investors, according to a regulatory filing . Twenty-three investors participated in the equity funding round, according to the filing, which was made public earlier this week. Founded in 2011, Invenra has now raised more than $21 million in equity and debt financing, according to SEC documents . Invenra plans to use some of the new money for product development, and to add to its 26-person team, says co-founder and CEO Roland Green. Invenra plans to hire bench scientists, project managers, and people with preclinical development experience, he says. The startup also plans to expand its laboratory and office space, Green says. Madison-based Venture Investors led the round, according to a news release . Other participants included return backer Wisconsin Investment Partners and a new investor, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which manages more than $117 billion for organizations like the Wisconsin Retirement System. Invenra’s core business involves discovering antibodies and performing related biology work around targets the startup’s partners have identified. Invenra’s partners are then responsible for taking the drugs forward into the clinic. They include AgonOx , Exelixis (NASDAQ: EXEL ), Merck (NYSE: MRK ), and Oxford BioTherapeutics . A majority of the collaborations Invenra has publicized focus at least in part on developing new cancer therapies. However, Invenra’s technology could also be used to make antibodies for targets known to cause infectious disease, autoimmune disease, and other conditions, company leaders have said. The antibodies Invenra develops are designed to stick to a specific target—a disease-causing protein, for instance—and then perform functions on the targets. Invenra concentrates on antibodies for immuno-oncology that are multi-specific, meaning they can bind to more than one antigen simultaneously. According to Invenra’s website , the only therapeutic candidate currently in its pipeline that has advanced into the preclinical phase of development—past the discovery and “lead selection” phases—is one being advanced with Exelixis. Invenra also has its own internal pipeline of antibodies designed to bind to targets the company has identified itself. Green has said his company would eventually find a partner to further develop its own internally discovered drug candidates if they progress as hoped. Jeff Buchanan is the editor of Xconomy Seattle.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Friday October 19 2018 11:13 AM. This week, Joan Jordan champions her professional revitalisation and shares with us all the joys of returning to the workforce. Sorry for the spoiler in the title. You already know how this one is going to play out. Girl studies hard and gets a computer science place in Trinity College. Girl works her arse off and builds a nice little life for herself and her family. Girl is winning. Girl firmly believes that bad things happen to other people. She has plans, you see……. Mike Tyson nailed it when he said, “everyone has a plan ‘till they get punched in the mouth.” Next thing- girl is punch drunk and wondering how on earth she got into this position? More importantly, how was she going to get out of it? When the editorial team asked me what they wanted to write about this week, I must say that I felt a bit anxious. I still feel shame over having to throw in the towel and stop working in 2009. I didn’t get formally diagnosed until 2010 and until then, lived with the unsettling conviction that something was really, really, really, wrong with me. I HAD to stop working. End of story. It was destroying me every day. Not knowing what was destroying me made it even worse. People like explanations and I just did not have one to give. I didn’t realise how important having a job was to my standing in society. It’s one thing to stop working as a lifestyle decision – another entirely when you feel forced into it. People ask difficult questions. Social outings and meeting new people became awkward. I also felt terribly guilty about not having my own money. Actually, the story didn’t end there. After chasing a lot of dead ends, I retrained and now work 15 hours a week from home. I do my work in the mornings before cog-fog sets in. My business card says that I am the EUPATI Content Coordinator. I love my job and do not take it for granted for a second. I’m even happy to be back paying taxes! Long story short, it was not easy to get back into gainful employment, but it is possible. If one good thing has out of all I went through when I had to stop working, it’s that I learned more about compassion. Being kind is important (and that includes being kind to yourself). Don’t judge others when you are not standing in their shoes. If you feel that you are stuck in a situation through no fault of your own- seek help. I’m glad I went to Citizens Information to find out what my options were when I had to stop working. Dedicated to MS.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693707265683376099/Discussions---MS-Connection	Discussions - MS Connection	"Oct 12, 2018 1:51 PM. Eating Habits & MS *. Oct 16, 2018 7:01 PM. I’m wondering the same thing. I can tell you I just purchased Dr. Wahl’s book. So far I’m reading The Wahl’s protocol. A radical way to treat chronic autoimmune conditions. So far this book is great. She also has books out on food. Also my brilliant daughter read this book by Paul Farmer..... Mountains beyond Mountains. He’s her idol. He goes into illnesses and did experiments with vitamins, food, placebos ect., too see if our intake of both helps our illnesses. Pretty heavy duty stuff. This guy is truly amazing. In short she got me on all natural nuts, fruit and vegetables. I’ve noticed a huge difference just in 2 weeks. Although she currently moved away, the reading materials are with her as well. Which brought me to Dr. Wahl’s. I hope this helps somewhat. I also know going gluten free is a big success. I hope you may post results once you find more answers. Oh and I wanted to add this. She told me changing my diet will take a good couple of months before I noticed anything due to getting rid of all the other toxins (to us) out of our systems before feeling results. Oct 22, 2018 10:34 AM. Genetics and a transient thyroid condition have made me particularly slender. Unhelpfully, my MS reduces my hunger and makes both task-switching and choosing difficult. My MS (and everything else) worsen if my eating habits don't included a habit of eating. I need to ignore any advice that includes avoiding any foods/only eating certain foods because the additional requirements make me less likely to eat at all. More than anything, what I need is calories. Fatigue is worse if you don't have fuel to burn. I try to have healthy, high-calorie food at hand. My fatigue increases if I go three days without meat, so I try not to go meatless for more than a day. I make no claims on what helps MS generally, but I know this is best for me, specifically. And now... now I need to go get something to eat. Nov 03, 2018 3:03 PM. Since I'm a fourth generation baker, I have quite the sweet tooth and passion for good breads. That being said, my gallbladder was removed several years ago so I had to choose a healthier way of living. Even though I haven't been following it religiously, The Mediterranean Diet concept seems to work for me. Big time fats: bye bye! Overly greasy foods: see ya! Fruits and veggies: can't get enough of them! Sweet stuff: one big sweet or junk food snack a day and call it good. I LOVE seafood and cooking and flavoring with olive oil, so that diet concept works for me and I maintain my blood sugar at work with fig bars, granola bars, a small stack of crackers (I keep some snacks in my locker), or by getting a cup of popcorn chicken from the deli.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. MS and The 2019 Budget. Monday October 08 2018 11:13 AM. Before Budget 2019, Helen Farrell shares her opinion on the financial challenges of living with MS and how the Irish State can truly support people. Our government ministers have an unenviable task in preparing our 2019 budget. Not only do they have to cover existing commitments but they also must plan for future contingencies and emergencies. Ireland has never been good at investing properly in the future and is bedevilled with transport, housing, education, social welfare and health systems that are full of historic quick-fixes and panicked responses to crises and outrages since the foundation of the State. Investing in proper preventative planning usually takes more resources and a longer-term view than ever seems achievable to our governments; to the despair of many. It’s understandable that buying the approval of voters and ensuring a positive next election is very important for political parties; few go into politics to be in opposition. Our elected representatives have a duty to balance the health, housing, education, welfare, transport and environmental needs of Irish citizens with the money they have available, and to enhance people’s lives, not necessarily their pockets. People with MS would love our politicians to sit up and notice that our neurological services are woefully underfunded and do not compare at all favourably with the rest of Europe, or indeed globally. MS is something that arrives in our lives uninvited and makes itself at home for life, often damaging our earning potential and costing us in so many ways across our lifespan. With access to good healthcare, medication, rehabilitation and support, life can continue for many of us in a productive way (albeit changed) but only if we receive the proper support. It is false economy to stint on these supports. The more support we have when living with MS, the more we can continue to remain engaged with life, earning and contributing financially and in voluntary ways and putting less of a financial burden on the State. It makes good financial sense to invest in MSer’s and conversely very poor judgement to limit services and supports. A severe MS-relapse or disease-course is far costlier for our healthcare, social welfare and other systems to deal with than the optimal situation of keeping a person with MS as healthy as they can be. At a personal level I am still angry at the election promise reneged on in 2013, to give all people who hold the Long-Term Illness Card an automatic GP Visit Card . It would have made life much easier for us all with MS. Keep us well and we’ll be more productive, for longer. MS Ireland’s pre-budget submission makes for sober reading ( read here ). The key asks of MS Ireland for Budget 2019 involve proper investment in neurology services, neurorehabilitation, community services and housing adaptation, as well as automatic entitlement to a GP Visit Card. Although our Social Welfare services can provide good support for those of us who can’t work full-time or at all, more needs to be done to “make work pay”, although I personally dislike that phrase. There’s a whiff of the opinion that people who access Social Welfare are choosing not to work when they weigh up the financial “benefits” in favour of a life of State support. Nothing could be further from the truth for most of us. We are trying to hang on with grim determination of any remnant of our former pre-MS working lives, reinventing ourselves, constantly adjusting and trying to outwit this disease. Another area that MS Ireland would like addressed is the amount of income disregarded when applying for Medical Cards. In people with MS on lower incomes, the disregard should be far higher, due to identified higher costs of living with MS. It is an exciting time in terms of new treatments emerging for MS. There have been quite a few new disease-modifying medications licensed in recent years that provide greater efficacy against MS, and the promise of more to come. New and innovative medications cost money and the government need to ring-fence spending to cover this for the future. All in all, a lot for our government to consider. But short-term planning benefit nobody and makes no prudential sense in the long-run. What we need now is our government to focus on playing the long game; just like MS does with us.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295887488397983/Spasticity-and-MS:-How-to-Control-Your-Muscles	Spasticity and MS: How to Control Your Muscles	Many people with multiple sclerosis have stiff muscles and spasms, a condition called spasticity. It happens mostly in the muscles of the legs and arms, and it may keep you from moving your limbs freely. You might feel spasticity either as stiffness that doesn't go away or as movements you can't control that come and go, especially at night. It can feel like a muscle tightening, or it can be very painful. Spasticity also can make you ache or feel tight in and around your joints and low back. How you feel can vary depending on your position, posture, and how relaxed you are. What Causes Spasticity? Spasticity happens because of an imbalance in the electrical signals coming from the brain and spinal cord, often when multiple sclerosis has damaged the nerves there. This unevenness makes your muscles contract on their own and makes them tense. :::::::. 	1	0	Spasticity|and|MS|:|How|to|Control|Your|Muscles	Many|people|with|multiple|sclerosis|have|stiff|muscles|and|spasms|,|a|condition|called|spasticity|.|It|happens|mostly|in|the|muscles|of|the|legs|and|arms|,|and|it|may|keep|you|from|moving|your|limbs|freely|.|You|might|feel|spasticity|either|as|stiffness|that|doesn't|go|away|or|as|movements|you|can't|control|that|come|and|go|,|especially|at|night|.|It|can|feel|like|a|muscle|tightening|,|or|it|can|be|very|painful|.|Spasticity|also|can|make|you|ache|or|feel|tight|in|and|around|your|joints|and|low|back|.|How|you|feel|can|vary|depending|on|your|position|,|posture|,|and|how|relaxed|you|are|.|What|Causes|Spasticity|?|Spasticity|happens|because|of|an|imbalance|in|the|electrical|signals|coming|from|the|brain|and|spinal|cord|,|often|when|multiple|sclerosis|has|damaged|the|nerves|there|.|This|unevenness|makes|your|muscles|contract|on|their|own|and|makes|them|tense|.|::|:|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531952336786498/Imaginary-Pain---MS-Connection	Imaginary Pain - MS Connection	The buzzing throughout my arms, hands, legs and feet had not let up for 3 full days. My annual checkup with my neurologist was just a day away, so I figured, what better timing? I practically danced into the office and was so excited to get some answers about this newfound pain. Enter the man of the hour, and come to find out, it’s… all… in my head? Excuse me? Everyone tends to experience very different symptoms when it comes to their own personal journey with MS. Some people react poorly to the heat, some have chronic headaches. For me, the pain I experience is something similar to growing pains. You know, that stretching and throbbing sensation you used to get when you were hitting your growth spurt? Now, take those growing pains and amplify that by about 1,000,000. That is the pain I experience most often in my own personal journey with MS. I explained this to my neurologist, and he genuinely told me it was all in my head; that other than “numbness and tingling,” there is no other type of pain associated with multiple sclerosis. When I stepped into that office, hopeful and looking for an explanation, I left feeling very distraught. No, a better word would be angry . I was angry that this was only happening to me and that no one else experienced this type of pain. I was angry that this disease chose me to send these abnormal throbbing sensations throughout my body and deep into my core. What made me special? Absolutely nothing. I spent some time thinking on it and concluded that I was not the one who was different here, but that I was given some faulty information. I decided to reach out to my supportive community through my Instagram account and asked other MS warriors like myself if they had ever experienced this pain, too. The conclusion? I got about 15 messages in my inbox singing the hallelujah choir that someone else understood. That their neurologists had also told them it was all their imagination. It was both invigorating and terrifying. I felt so reassured to know that others understood exactly what I was going through, but I was also concerned at just how many physicians are out there telling their patients that their very real pain is only in their head. Since the day of my diagnosis when my first neurologist told me my quality of life would suffer and I would never run again, I have questioned the word of others. I respect them for their education and appreciate the help they provide me, but I question everything . I run at least 5K a week and live in the gym. My quality of life is A-Okay, so I proved that first doctor wrong. I proved the second one wrong with my supportive community of amazing MS warriors, too. At the end of the day, our experience is our own, but always remember something: this is your story. You are not crazy, you are justified in how you feel, and you are never alone. Keep pushing forward and remember that together we are stronger than MS!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692354226208631525/Its-Nice-to-Be-Understood	It’s Nice to Be Understood	Last week I was honored to attend and emcee the annual conference of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland. It was, of course, an informative event with speakers from around Europe presenting research results as well as great tips for living our best lives with (and in spite of) multiple sclerosis (MS) . If you care to sift through the day, the live stream was captured on video for all to review. While I did learn much, from how important exercise is to healthy brain chemistry to the differences between how people with MS are treated in the United Kingdom versus Ireland versus the United States, as is oft the case with such events, it was the off-line and sidebar conversations that were most helpful. The Power of Being in a Room Full of People With MS. Time after time I remember and forget, only to be reminded again, just how powerful it is to be in a room filled with people living with — and trying to live well with — MS. Not everyone is living with their disease the same way. Not everyone at the conference was doing as well as when I saw them at last year’s event. Still, from the newly diagnosed trying to find information in the white noise of the early stages to those with advanced MS who can only travel with accompanied assistance, we all sought another addition to our MS tool kit . Those in attendance ranged from the passionately outspoken to the timid. They were current leaders of industry and common laborers. We were the medically retired and those seeking to stay employed . There were parents and grandparents, young people, and even teens with MS in attendance. And there were caregivers , care partners, spouses, family, friends, and employers We all lived with multiple sclerosis, even if not everyone had been diagnosed with the disease. We laughed, we learned. We commiserated, we cried. We caught up with those we’d not seen in far too long, we missed those unable to attend. We mourned some who have left this world. We quietly plotted ourselves on the timeline of MS and gauged our progression with those we’ve seen year over year. We were doing better than some we met and not as well as others. We talked of exercise and of diets, of family members and of pets. We did what every group of friends who only meet up occasionally do, which made us feel “normal” in our abnormalities. RELATED: When MS Makes ‘Normal’ a Moving Target. ‘The Best Club I Never Wanted to Join’. I suppose it’s impossible to say that one part of the event was more important than any other. So much good intent was all around us. But I will say that research outcomes will always shift, professional opinions will evolve, and PowerPoint presentations will always be tweaked. What won’t change at events like this is the power of a group of different-minded people, from all walks of life with little in common other than a disease, becoming fast friends. “It’s the best club I never wanted to join,” I once heard someone say in reference to people with MS . The disease — and more importantly the fact that we are all striving for our best possible lives while having the disease — is what links us all. That fact allows for us to reach out into what sometimes seems like the darkest of dark times and find someone who has been there before . The Special Bond of Not Having to Explain Myself. Some people find comfort in more regular self-help groups or occasional meet-ups with a few people living with MS. Not everyone, however, has those available, for a number of reasons. Even if we can’t get together with others with MS (or think we mightn’t want to) all that often, I find a special bond and comfort when I don’t have to explain why I have to excuse myself to the loo six times during a conversation, don’t have to suffer the pitiful looks when I struggle out of a chair, or don’t feel that more than a nod and a wink is needed to excuse myself early from an evening of fun. If I really think about it, I’m probably a better friend to those dear ones who don’t have MS because of the things I’ve learned from my friends who do. Wishing you and your family the best of health. My book, Chef Interrupted , is available on Amazon .

The Bayesian risk estimate at onset - BREMSO - correlates with cognitive and physical disability in patients with early multiple sclerosis.	BACKGROUND: Prevention of long-term disability is the goal of therapeutic intervention in Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS). The Bayesian Risk Estimate for MS at Onset (BREMSO) gives an individual risk score predicting disease evolution into Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS). We investigated whether BREMSO correlates with physical disability, cognitive dysfunction, and regional brain atrophy early in MS. METHODS: One hundred RRMS patients with at least two years of follow-up were enrolled. BREMSO score as well as Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS), Timed 25-Foot Walk Test (T25-FW) and 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT), were assessed. Intracranial volume (ICV), subcortical gray matter structures and corpus callosum (CC) were automatically segmented on MRI images and their volumes measured. RESULTS: BREMSO score correlated negatively with SDMT at visit1 (β = -0.33, p = 0.019), visit2 (β = -0.34, p = 0.017) and visit3 (β = -0.34, p = 0.014), and positively with MSSS at visit1 (r = 0.38, p = 0.006), visit2 (r = 0.47, p. CONCLUSIONS: BREMSO score at onset correlated with physical disability (MSSS), cognitive function (SDMT) and CC volume measurements in patients with early MS. Copyright © 2018.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Thursday September 20 2018 10:50 AM. This week Declan Groeger shares with us what it is like being a man living with MS. I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in 1988. Married with two small children, a mortgage and an overdraft. The day the doctor said “You have MS” , my life changed forever. At that time MS had no known cause, no treatment and no cure. Any plans I had for the future were left swinging in the wind. The cause is still unknown, a cure has still not been found but there are many treatment options available now and more in the pipeline. How did I feel on hearing those unforgettable words? It was 30 years ago and memories dim with time, and MS, but I do remember being overcome with emotions, crying and wondering what path my illness would take. I did take heart from the fact that a maternal uncle had been living with MS for more than 20 years and he was doing fine. Did I feel inadequate after the diagnosis? Certainly not in the immediate aftermath, and probably not in the early years while I was feeling good. I felt so good that I sought a second opinion after ten years. This unfortunately confirmed my diagnosis. Deep down I knew I’d been grasping at straws- the signs and symptoms had become more apparent and I knew the downward slide had begun. I started medicating at this point. I never saw myself in the classic ‘hunter gatherer’ role but I knew that as time passed any role I would, or could, play in our family life would be seriously affected. Jean and I discussed it and agreed that we couldn’t rely on my ability to remain in gainful employment and bring in a steady income and from then on Jean donned the mantle of bread-winner. I was no longer ‘the man of the house’, although I remained in full-time employment for a further 22 years. MS had relegated me to the second division. That was the first knock to my manliness and many more knocks were to follow over the years. I was afraid of being perceived as lazy as long as my illness remained invisible. That’s not to say I wanted everyone to know I had MS. It was my private torment and I didn’t know how to handle its invisibility. All of the people who mattered to me had learned to live with, and accept, my constraints a long time before I did. I slowly came to realise that I was the only one who looked at me the way I looked at me. Jean never made me feel inadequate or lazy, that was all down to me. My share of the housework was to look after the garden but I always felt I should be doing more. One of my earliest pieces of Assistive Technology was a ride-on lawn mower obviously needed to cut the grass but also to move tools etc. around. Every job took much longer for me, used twice as much energy and in 2014 I threw in the towel on that particular activity. I was never a big drinker but I did enjoy having a few pints. I never had a ‘local’ as such but even that ‘not drinking much’ suffered from MS; I was no longer comfortable going to a pub. The prospect of wobbling my way to the bar or toilet became too much of a struggle and I was very much aware of people watching and silently passing judgment. I’m not drunk I have MS. Men of my age group are not great at discussing and sharing our thoughts and feelings and I am no different. I kept my feelings of inadequacy under tight control. There was no reason to burden anyone else; suck it up and get on with life. I would urge other men living with MS not to suffer in silence but to seek out help and talk about it. 	1	1	MS|Ireland|::|Helping|Everyone|Affected|by|Multiple|Sclerosis	MS|Ireland|::|.|Helping|Everyone|Affected|by|Multiple|Sclerosis|.|Thursday|September|20|2018|10:50|AM|.|This|week|Declan|Groeger|shares|with|us|what|it|is|like|being|a|man|living|with|MS|.|I|was|diagnosed|with|Multiple|Sclerosis|(|MS|)|in|1988|.|Married|with|two|small|children|,|a|mortgage|and|an|overdraft|.|The|day|the|doctor|said|“|You|have|MS|”|,|my|life|changed|forever|.|At|that|time|MS|had|no|known|cause|,|no|treatment|and|no|cure|.|Any|plans|I|had|for|the|future|were|left|swinging|in|the|wind|.|The|cause|is|still|unknown|,|a|cure|has|still|not|been|found|but|there|are|many|treatment|options|available|now|and|more|in|the|pipeline|.|How|did|I|feel|on|hearing|those|unforgettable|words|?|It|was|30|years|ago|and|memories|dim|with|time|,|and|MS|,|but|I|do|remember|being|overcome|with|emotions|,|crying|and|wondering|what|path|my|illness|would|take|.|I|did|take|heart|from|the|fact|that|a|maternal|uncle|had|been|living|with|MS|for|more|than|20|years|and|he|was|doing|fine|.|Did|I|feel|inadequate|after|the|diagnosis|?|Certainly|not|in|the|immediate|aftermath|,|and|probably|not|in|the|early|years|while|I|was|feeling|good|.|I|felt|so|good|that|I|sought|a|second|opinion|after|ten|years|.|This|unfortunately|confirmed|my|diagnosis|.|Deep|down|I|knew|I|’|d|been|grasping|at|straws|-|the|signs|and|symptoms|had|become|more|apparent|and|I|knew|the|downward|slide|had|begun|.|I|started|medicating|at|this|point|.|I|never|saw|myself|in|the|classic|‘|hunter|gatherer|’|role|but|I|knew|that|as|time|passed|any|role|I|would|,|or|could|,|play|in|our|family|life|would|be|seriously|affected|.|Jean|and|I|discussed|it|and|agreed|that|we|couldn|’|t|rely|on|my|ability|to|remain|in|gainful|employment|and|bring|in|a|steady|income|and|from|then|on|Jean|donned|the|mantle|of|bread-winner|.|I|was|no|longer|‘|the|man|of|the|house|’|,|although|I|remained|in|full-time|employment|for|a|further|22|years|.|MS|had|relegated|me|to|the|second|division|.|That|was|the|first|knock|to|my|manliness|and|many|more|knocks|were|to|follow|over|the|years|.|I|was|afraid|of|being|perceived|as|lazy|as|long|as|my|illness|remained|invisible|.|That|’|s|not|to|say|I|wanted|everyone|to|know|I|had|MS|.|It|was|my|private|torment|and|I|didn|’|t|know|how|to|handle|its|invisibility|.|All|of|the|people|who|mattered|to|me|had|learned|to|live|with|,|and|accept|,|my|constraints|a|long|time|before|I|did|.|I|slowly|came|to|realise|that|I|was|the|only|one|who|looked|at|me|the|way|I|looked|at|me|.|Jean|never|made|me|feel|inadequate|or|lazy|,|that|was|all|down|to|me|.|My|share|of|the|housework|was|to|look|after|the|garden|but|I|always|felt|I|should|be|doing|more|.|One|of|my|earliest|pieces|of|Assistive|Technology|was|a|ride-on|lawn|mower|obviously|needed|to|cut|the|grass|but|also|to|move|tools|etc|.|around|.|Every|job|took|much|longer|for|me|,|used|twice|as|much|energy|and|in|2014|I|threw|in|the|towel|on|that|particular|activity|.|I|was|never|a|big|drinker|but|I|did|enjoy|having|a|few|pints|.|I|never|had|a|‘|local|’|as|such|but|even|that|‘|not|drinking|much|’|suffered|from|MS|;|I|was|no|longer|comfortable|going|to|a|pub|.|The|prospect|of|wobbling|my|way|to|the|bar|or|toilet|became|too|much|of|a|struggle|and|I|was|very|much|aware|of|people|watching|and|silently|passing|judgment|.|I|’|m|not|drunk|I|have|MS|.|Men|of|my|age|group|are|not|great|at|discussing|and|sharing|our|thoughts|and|feelings|and|I|am|no|different|.|I|kept|my|feelings|of|inadequacy|under|tight|control|.|There|was|no|reason|to|burden|anyone|else|;|suck|it|up|and|get|on|with|life|.|I|would|urge|other|men|living|with|MS|not|to|suffer|in|silence|but|to|seek|out|help|and|talk|about|it|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4699569004696920424/Improving-cognitive-function-in-MS:-A-researcher-looking-to-make-a-difference-for-people-diagnosed-with-progressive-MS---Blog---MS-Society-of-Canada	Improving cognitive function in MS: A researcher looking to make a difference for people diagnosed with progressive MS - Blog - MS Society of Canada	Cognitive impairment, a research priority for the MS Society of Canada, affects a significant proportion of people living with MS. Multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause a reduction in brain size (also called brain atrophy). Research has shown that this atrophy and lesions developed in MS can be linked to the presence of cognitive difficulties. Cognitive difficulties affect up to seventy percent of individuals living with progressive MS, predominantly impacting information processing and speed, learning and memory, executive function and perceptual processing. Also, individuals themselves have voiced cognitive impairment as an area of concern that needs to be addressed. Five years ago, I traveled around the country and engaged the MS Community (researchers, caregivers, individuals living with MS) to find out what areas of research are important to them—cognition and mental health was one of them! The good news? There is evidence to suggest that cognitive rehabilitation has the potential to improve cognitive function. There is a need for effective cognitive rehabilitation for those living with MS. Cognitive rehabilitation aims to enhance a person’s ability to process and interpret information, and to improve the ability to function in family and community life. A few studies have already evaluated cognitive rehabilitation strategies to improve various areas of cognition, including memory, communication, and attention skills. While a great deal of progress has been made in identifying treatments for cognitive dysfunction, there is more research that needs to be conducted. Many studies lack control (mock treatment) group, are not large enough to make adequate conclusions from the interventions, or are limited to the MS population in general (all types of MS) or only people with relapsing-remitting MS. Cognition and Exercise. One promising intervention that may improve cognition is exercise. Historically, individuals living with MS were advised to avoid physical exertion for fear that physical activity will make them feel worse. Over the past few decades, new research has uncovered considerable benefits associated with increased physical activity, and perceptions among the MS community have shifted toward encouraging a more active lifestyle. There is evidence that physical activity and exercise can help to maintain the individual’s independence, enhance their quality of life, and lead to improved cognitive functioning due to the beneficial effects of physical activity on brain health. However, the effects of exercise on cognition has been predominantly evaluated on persons with relapsing-remitting MS. Furthermore, different exercise interventions have shown mixed results on cognition which could be attributed to differences in exercises methodologies (exercise type, intensity, frequency and program duration) used between studies. There is a need to perform randomized control trials, with larger sample sizes, longer durations, and broader evaluations to better assess the role of exercise on cognition. Furthermore, when looking at rehabilitation in MS, a single intervention may not be sufficient in improving symptoms – synergistic approaches may be required. Therefore, strategies that combine two interventions, such as cognitive rehabilitation and exercise, may have the potential to produce the greatest improvements in MS. MS Society-supported research aims to improve cognition by combining cognitive rehabilitation and exercise. Recently, we announced support of a $5 million project which will test if cognitive rehabilitation, or exercise, or a combined approach of cognitive rehabilitation and exercise will improve cognitive function in individuals living with progressive MS. This clinical study is the first of its kind to use a large sample that incorporates many countries and has the potential to define how best to treat cognitive dysfunction in people diagnosed with progressive MS. The researcher leading the effort to improve cognition in people diagnosed with progressive MS. The researcher leading this large project on improving cognitive function through a randomized clinical trial is Dr. Anthony Feinstein. Dr. Anthony Feinstein is a Neuropsychiatrist and Associate Scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. He is also a Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto. Dr. Feinstein has researched behavioral disorders in people with MS for 26 years and runs a busy clinical practice in which over 80 percent of the patients have MS. Dr. Feinstein’s studies entail detailed neuropsychological testing, brain imaging (both structural and functional) and quantification of mood symptoms. More recently, Dr. Feinstein has also begun a series of studies looking at how cannabis might affect cognition and brain imaging in people with MS. Currently, the Society is supporting two projects led by Dr. Feinstein, one is the clinical trial for improving cognition and another which is evaluating the effects of cannabis on cognition. Learn more about Dr. Feinstein:. How did you become interested in MS research? What inspires you to continue advancing research in this field? I first became interested in multiple sclerosis research after my residency, which was in London, England. My PhD was devoted to detecting cognitive difficulties in people with MS and looking for correlates with brain MRI. This was a nascent field at the time and as such there was a very small literature on these topics. After completing my PhD, I continued to pursue my interest in multiple sclerosis. Indeed, it is fair to say that it was through my PhD that I developed a lifelong interest in this particular disorder and the behavioral consequence of it. I continue to remain an active researcher because there are so many unanswered questions. MS is a fascinating disease and the degree to which it can affect behavior across a wide domain has yet to be fully explored. While much more is known about the behavioral consequence of MS now compared to when I first entered the field the advances in technology are continuing to open up new research possibilities which ultimately benefits patient care. What do you enjoy most about doing research and what are some of the challenges you face? What I enjoy most about research is trying to be innovative. While I recognize that replication is, of course, important and essential, coming up with new findings which can affect the quality of patient care is rewarding. The challenges faced are those of obtaining funding in an increasingly competitive research environment and retaining bright young investigators who often want to move on to other opportunities because of better financial and work-related opportunities. Describe the importance and level of collaboration in your research? Collaboration is essential for my research. To begin with, I could not begin to do my research without having good relationships with my colleagues in Neurology who refer patients to me, both clinically and for research purposes. I also collaborate with colleagues in Neuroimaging and Neuropsychology and more recently, Engineering. These links are pivotal to the success of my research work. How important is the support from the MS Society in enabling you to conduct research? The support from the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada has been integral to my research success. The Society has funded my studies looking at brain MRI correlates of depression, the development of computerized tests of cognition for people with MS, a series of studies exploring the cognitive and imaging changes linked to cannabis use in people with MS, the studies investigates the prevalence, clinical significance and cognitive correlates of pseudobulbar affect in people with MS and more recently the large multi-centre study looking at cognitive rehabilitation and exercise in people with progressive MS.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Tuesday September 18 2018 08:00 PM. We need YOUR help in contacting TDs and Senators. MS Ireland will be holding an event in Leinster House AV room on Wednesday, 3rd October 2018 at 10am. We will be presenting the MS Care Centre Business Case and we will be using the opportunity to call on TDs and Senators to provide a further €600,000 in annual investment which would allow us to cater for the increased demand on our Care Centre. We need your help in contacting TDs and Senators to ask them to come along to the event – if you can attend your local TD’s clinic, please bring the event to their attention and ask them to go along. You can also email them – you can find who your local TD is and get their contact details using this website: https://www.whoismytd.com/. Below is a draft email that you can use – please feel free to adapt the email to include information on your own personal situation and what their support would mean to you. If you receive a response from your TD saying they intend to go along, please let our Information, Advocacy and Research Assistant Aoife Kirwan know so she can follow up with their office to remind them beforehand – email akirwan@ms-society.ie. Dear Deputy [insert name of TD] ,. My name is [insert your name] . I am asking you to attend an AV room briefing on Wednesday, 3rd October at 10am. This briefing will be delivered by the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland (MS Ireland) regarding a request MS Ireland has put forward for further annual investment in their care centre. The MS Care Centre is a state-of-the-art respite facility. Admitting and welcoming 400 people annually, the care centre not only provides people living with MS and their caregivers a break but delivers a range of therapeutic services, neurological assessments and social activities. Due to decreased income, the care centre only opens 40 weeks per year. MS Ireland are requesting a further €600,000 in annual investment which would allow them to cater for the increased demand on the service. This would see the care centre open 350 days per year, providing an extra 1,128 bed-nights annually. This would allow additional people living with MS the chance to benefit from what the care centre has to offer (there are over 9,000 people living with MS in Ireland). Further investment will not only support people living with MS, it will also support voluntary carers, without whom care in the home would be impossible, putting further pressure on our health system and hospital funding. [If you have any personal details you would like to add in support of our ask, please feel free to write it in]. As a member of your constituency, I am asking that you support MS Ireland by doing what you can to help secure this additional funding. Yours sincerely,.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295958471635336/What-Triggers-Your-Sensory-Overload?	What Triggers Your Sensory Overload?	“The common one is when the work environment gets loud and busy, but the newest, and one that seems the strangest, is any warehouse type store. The extremely tall and long aisles, even when they're practically empty.” — Amy L., living with MS. “Large crowds. Bright big stores. Sometimes I go to the store, walk in, say ‘nope,’ and go home.” — Bonnie W., living with MS. “The grocery store and heavy traffic. Makes me feel scatterbrained and ‘lost.’” — Amber A., living with MS. “An environment I'm not used to, physically and/or mentally. Still don't know how to deal with them.” — Rona M., living with MS. “Being away from home too long. I get very anxious.” — Sherri H., living with MS. “Being tired can trigger it, real bright lights, a lot of motion, lights, noise at the same time, trying to listen and talk in a setting with other input.” — Kelly H., living with MS. “Fatigue is probably the number one cause of my sensory overload, but it's not always the culprit. If there are too many noises at once, they all seem to be competing to be the loudest, resulting in complete overload. In turn, I become a complete wreck. Tremors, feeling extremely uneasy, and anxious. All this holds true with an overload of any other sensual stimulus or combination of sensory overload events.” — Gail F., living with MS. “Someone who sits next to me and talks nonstop, especially in the late afternoon when extra fatigued, or just loud people with lots of energy … I'm like chocolate on a hot pavement … I melt down to a mess.” — Lisa F., living with MS. “In restaurants, I request not to be seated directly under a speaker. Music, combined with people's voices and kitchen clatter, drives me crazy.” — Connie R., living with MS. “Dinner at Texas Roadhouse with all the birthdays and singing and celebrations. Just gets to be too much!” — Judy C., living with MS. “Noise coming from multiple directions and high-pitched sounds like the clanking of dishes and silverware together, or children screeching. Restaurants with high ceilings and open kitchens are the worst for me because every sound just feels multiplied.” — Erin H., living with MS. “Being in a crowd or a loud room where I'm unable to tune some of the noise out. Hustling and bustling crowds are the worst between the sounds, the people, and my balance issues.” — Cindi P., living with MS. “Too many voices at once.”— Robin G., living with MS. Too many things to count. “Bright lights, too loud, children screeching, hot with odd smells, some industrial sounds, sometimes even reading can be too much if the lights are wrong or the setting is overwhelming.” — Alysin P., living with MS. “Going to the grocery store, being tired, the doctors telling me too much all at once, restaurants, people who don’t control their screaming, running kids.” — Stacy N., living with MS. “Large stores with a lot of color and visual stimulation; flashing or strobe lights especially in the dark; too much, too loud, or specific types of noise such as screeching or sirens; crowds or fast-paced and bustling activity.” — Polly P., living with MS.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Monday September 10 2018 11:46 AM. Fintan Murphy (MSc Physiotherapy) along with Professor Susan Coote (School of Allied Health) of the University of Limerick are inviting you to take part in an online questionnaire examining physical activity behaviour in people with Multiple Sclerosis . This is an international project in collaboration with researchers in the USA and in Germany. Who can participate? People with a diagnosis of MS and aged 18 years or older can participate in this study. We are inviting people with MS who “fit into” all levels of physical activity to take part. So, you do not have to be a physically active person to take part in this study. Aim of research study:. The aim of the research is to understand the factors associated with physical activity so that future studies can design and appropriate exercise programmes for people with MS. What do I have to do? If you decide to take part you will complete an online questionnaire consisting of 63 questions. The questionnaire will take 40 minutes (approx) and you can complete it over one or two sittings if desired.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295868458390605/MS-Views-and-News:	MS Views and News:	ARDSLEY, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ACOR) today announced that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, by a 2-1 vote, has upheld the United States District Court for the District of Delaware’s decision to invalidate four AMPYRA patents. This decision affirms the District Court’s ruling on March 31, 2017 invalidating U.S. Patent Nos. 8,663,685 (the ‘685 patent), 8,007,826 (the ‘826 patent), 8,440,703 (the ‘703 patent), and 8,354,437 (the ‘437 patent) pertaining to AMPYRA® (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg. Acorda’s U.S. Patent No. 5,540,938 (the ‘938 patent), previously upheld by the District Court, expired on July 30, 2018. “We are disappointed by the Court’s decision, as we continue to believe that our AMPYRA patents reflected true invention and were valid. We are reviewing the decision and will consider future options, including the possibility of a further appeal,” said Ron Cohen, M.D., Acorda's President and CEO. “Following the Court’s original decision in 2017, we prepared a contingency plan that we could face generic competition, implementing a comprehensive corporate restructuring and bolstering our balance sheet. As a result, we are well-capitalized and fully focused on the potential launch of INBRIJA for Parkinson’s disease.”. 	0	0	MS|Views|and|News|:	ARDSLEY|,|N|.|Y|.|-|-|(|BUSINESS|WIRE|)|-|-|Acorda|Therapeutics|,|Inc|.|(|Nasdaq|:|ACOR|)|today|announced|that|the|United|States|Court|of|Appeals|for|the|Federal|Circuit|,|by|a|2-1|vote|,|has|upheld|the|United|States|District|Court|for|the|District|of|Delaware|’|s|decision|to|invalidate|four|AMPYRA|patents|.|This|decision|affirms|the|District|Court|’|s|ruling|on|March|31|,|2017|invalidating|U|.|S|.|Patent|Nos|.|8,663|,|685|(|the|‘|685|patent|)|,|8,007|,|826|(|the|‘|826|patent|)|,|8,440|,|703|(|the|‘|703|patent|)|,|and|8,354|,|437|(|the|‘|437|patent|)|pertaining|to|AMPYRA|®|(|dalfampridine|)|Extended|Release|Tablets|,|10|mg|.|Acorda|’|s|U|.|S|.|Patent|No|.|5,540|,|938|(|the|‘|938|patent|)|,|previously|upheld|by|the|District|Court|,|expired|on|July|30|,|2018|.|“|We|are|disappointed|by|the|Court|’|s|decision|,|as|we|continue|to|believe|that|our|AMPYRA|patents|reflected|true|invention|and|were|valid|.|We|are|reviewing|the|decision|and|will|consider|future|options|,|including|the|possibility|of|a|further|appeal|,|”|said|Ron|Cohen|,|M|.|D|.|,|Acorda's|President|and|CEO|.|“|Following|the|Court|’|s|original|decision|in|2017|,|we|prepared|a|contingency|plan|that|we|could|face|generic|competition|,|implementing|a|comprehensive|corporate|restructuring|and|bolstering|our|balance|sheet|.|As|a|result|,|we|are|well-capitalized|and|fully|focused|on|the|potential|launch|of|INBRIJA|for|Parkinson|’|s|disease|.|”|.

Rasmussen's encephalitis is a rare autoimmune disease that primarily affects children and can lead to seizures. As the disease is resistant to drug treatments, it frequently requires surgical interventions aiming to remove or disconnect the affected part of the brain. Researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) have succeeded in describing and mastering the mechanisms at work within neurons in mice, opening the way to possible treatments. It was previously thought that neurons were the target of immune system cells that attack synapses, the connections between neurons. But researchers have discovered that the neurons themselves play an active role in triggering this process. Their research is published by Cell . In Rasmussen encephalitis, like in other encephalitis, the presence of an antigen in the affected neurons triggers an immune system response, resulting in synaptic alterations. A team of researchers led by Doron Merkler, Associate Professor in the Department of Pathology and Immunology at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine and senior consultant in the Clinical Pathology Service of the HUG, was able to show that neurons are not only passive victims of this attack, but play an essential role in triggering a defense mechanism that ultimately leads to their own damage. ""Following the attack by CD8+ T lymphocytes of the immune system, which fight against viral infections, the neuron produces a chemical signal to other cells called phagocytes which then attack the synapses. It's a sort of tripartite tango with tragic consequences"", explains Doron Merkler. A double attack on the synapses. Triggered by the neuronal antigen, CD8+ T lymphocytes release a protein, IFN-γ, captured by corresponding neuronal receptor. Subsequently neurons activate the STAT 1 signaling pathway which leads to the production of a molecule called CCL2. The latter molecule diffuses into the neuronal environment where it activates other immune cell types called phagocytes: these are microglial cells present in the brain and macrophages derived from the blood circulation. These two types of phagocytes finally attack the synapses. &laquoIf we manage to cut off the signal emitted by the neuron, this whole cascade of causes and consequences could be blocked, stresses Giovanni Di Liberto, researcher in the Department of Pathology and Immunology at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine and first author of the study. A similar signaling signature could also be found in biopsies performed in more than 20 patients suffering from Rasmussen encephalitis, and researchers advocate that it is possibly identical for other forms of encephalitis. In mice experiments, this mechanism has been successfully blocked at different levels: The UNIGE and HUG teams have thus succeeded in blocking the signaling pathway of STAT1 and CCL2 molecules, as well as the migration and activation of phagocytes by pharmacological interventions and genetic manipulation, avoiding in all these cases the degradation of synapses and allowing for a better control of the disease. Researchers will now have to partner to pursue the development of a possible treatment and conduct the necessary clinical trials, a difficult task when it comes to rare diseases. ""But the principles we are describing are probably at work in other diseases that cause a strong immune response, and may even play a role in multiple sclerosis"", says Merkler.

Researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) have managed to manipulate the mechanisms underlying neuronal damage in Rasmussen’s encephalitis, potentially paving the way for new treatments of the disease. Image Credit: Kateryna Kon / Shutterstock. Working with neurons in a mouse model, Doron Merkler and colleagues have found a way to block the defense mechanism neurons themselves trigger that eventually causes their damage. The previous understanding of Rasmussen encephalitis, as with other forms of encephalitis, was that the antigen present on affected neurons triggers immune system cells to attack and alter synapses. However, the current study recently published in the journal Cell , shows that the neurons are not only passive victims of this attack but that they trigger this damaging immune response themselves. Following the attack by CD8+ T lymphocytes of the immune system, which fight against viral infections, the neuron produces a chemical signal to other cells called phagocytes which then attack the synapses. It's a sort of tripartite tango with tragic consequences.”. Doron Merkler, Lead Researcher. An antigen present on the neuron triggers CD8+ T lymphocytes to produce a protein called IFN-ƴ, which is taken up by its receptor on the neuron. This causes the neuron to activate the STAT 1 signaling pathway, which triggers the production of the molecule CCL2. In turn, that CCL2 molecule activates phagocytes that attack the synapse. First author Giovanni Di Liberto says cutting off the signal emitted by the neuron could block this whole cascade of causes and consequences. The team identified a similar signaling signature in biopsies taken from more than 20 patients with Rasmussen encephalitis and researchers propose that the signature is possibly the same in other forms of encephalitis. In the mouse model, the UNIGE and HUG teams used genetic manipulation and pharmacological agents to block the STAT1 signaling pathway and CCL2 production, as well as the activation and migration of phagocytes. This meant synapse degradation was avoided and the disease was easier to control. Next, researchers will need to explore potential treatments and conduct clinical trials, a difficult task to pursue with rare diseases.

Three hours at this workshop learning improvisation fundamentals has changed my perspective on life and MS. When we first got to the class, we were asked to choose an intention card, and I chose one that said, “Take risks.” I was taking this class because I wanted to challenge myself and to live outside of the safety bubble I had created. After we all introduced ourselves and stated our intentions, we split up into pairs and played our first improvisation game called 1, 2, 3. All we had to do was take turns saying 1, 2 and 3 and if either one of us messed up at all, we both had to raise our arms in the air and shout, “Yay!”.. 	1	1	MS|Connection|Blog|-|MS|Connection	A|few|weeks|ago|,|I|went|to|a|class|called|“|Forget|Your|Fear|&|Trust|Your|Truth|–|A|Personal|Growth|Workshop|”|held|at|Happier|Valley|Comedy|in|Hadley|,|MA|by|Pam|Victor|,|and|it|empowered|me|to|unleash|my|potential|and|stop|holding|myself|back|.|Three|hours|at|this|workshop|learning|improvisation|fundamentals|has|changed|my|perspective|on|life|and|MS|.|When|we|first|got|to|the|class|,|we|were|asked|to|choose|an|intention|card|,|and|I|chose|one|that|said|,|“|Take|risks|.|”|I|was|taking|this|class|because|I|wanted|to|challenge|myself|and|to|live|outside|of|the|safety|bubble|I|had|created|.|After|we|all|introduced|ourselves|and|stated|our|intentions|,|we|split|up|into|pairs|and|played|our|first|improvisation|game|called|1|,|2|,|3|.|All|we|had|to|do|was|take|turns|saying|1|,|2|and|3|and|if|either|one|of|us|messed|up|at|all|,|we|both|had|to|raise|our|arms|in|the|air|and|shout|,|“|Yay|!|”|..

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4706000549259111977/Discussions---MS-Connection	Discussions - MS Connection	"Aug 26, 2018 2:40 PM. Most likely MS *. About a month back I started noticing slight lack of sensation on right cheek - difficult to describe because if I touch on both cheeks with fingers it would feel the same but somehow the right side face would feel as if it has some glue on it or dry skin. Long story short, eventually went to neuro who prescribed brain MRI with and without contrast. By now I was convinced that this must be due to MS (I generally tend to settle on worst outcome expectations). The notes from radiologist came back with following -. ""There is no evidence of an acute infarct on diffusion-weighted imaging. No intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial fluid collections are seen. There is no mass effect midline shift. Sagittal images demonstrate normal midline structures. No leptomeningeal or parenchymal enhancing lesions are seen postcontrast imaging. No significant white matter lesions are seen on T2 and FLAIR imaging. Few scattered foci are noted within the subcortical white matter. The major intracranial flow voids are unremarkable on T2-weighted imaging. Ethmoid air cell and bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal thickening. Left sphenoid sinus small mucous retention cyst."" I thought this was a good news and may be sinus is causing it - until I saw the neuro back. As per the neuro the scattered foci hyperintensities does not indicate a perfect MRI and MS cannot be ruled out even though the images do not show classic MS presentation. As per what I was explained, those two spots of hyper intensities are not where typically MS lesions are found but yet at my age (40) I should not have those hyperintensities. So now I have been prescribed blood tests to check for lyme, lupus and other auto immune deseases as well as spinal tap. I have had no migraine headaches or any injuries in past. I do have alergy and sinus issues. I had few concerned questions so thought to turn here for help -. 1. How likely this indicates MS? I am wondering why would radiologist see the hyperintensities but yet say no demyelination or any other concerns? May be not an easy question to answer with such limited info but I'm curious. 2. What is the likely hood of spinal tap providing answer? I have not been presecribed Spinal MRI. Should I ask for it? 3. Is there any chance Vit-B12 deficiency could cause this? My vit B-12 level recently came 330, which is on the lower side but yet I am told by physician and neuro that it is within the range and levels have to be signficiantly below the range. They also said it doesn't usually cause any facial numbness. I would like to wait for my diagnosis to come back but in the meantime, are there any good links for me to read on vegetarian diet with MS, drug options and how to consider the best option, how quickly upon finding about the diagnosis you would need to be on drugs ( currently I donot have any symptoms other than the slight lack of sensation I feel). Aug 27, 2018 1:16 AM. s, we can not speak about whether or not there is indication of ms, sometimes doctors are not even sure. The report you got on the mri was pretty informative about what was and was not going on, it is , in my opinion, seriously impressive. I have had plenty of mris and most have never rulled out anything. You got your money's worth. And your neuro seems to be diligent. There are many psots here about diet, what has worked for them and what has not. You can also check on nmss.org to see what they have posted, also multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com to see what they have to say. You can ask the neuro why he thinks a spinal mri is not indicated and see if you agree with his impression or if you want to request one. Aug 27, 2018 9:39 AM. Hi there,. While we're not able to answer your medical questions, we do have some information on nutrition and disease-modifying treatments we can share:. I hope this is helpful - also hoping that you get answers soon. Sep 29, 2018 10:36 AM. Spintal tap results came back. Not sure what to make of it, have apptment in few days with the doctor. CSF Oligoclonal Bands Number - 0. Following all showing in the range -. CSF IgG/Albumin Ratio. CSF IgG Synthesis Rate (<0.0 mg/day). WBC, CSF (0/mm3). IgG, CSF. Glucose, CSF. Myelin Basic Protein. Nothing seems out of range on report at least so will see what the doc says as brain MRI didn't directly indicate MS either. In the mean time I took Vit B12 shots and started B-12 methylcobalamin supplement afterwards as well and want to believe improved significantly.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Thursday August 16 2018 10:16 AM. This week Fergal Hughes wonders about what the future holds for him in terms of his MS ... and realises that he is more concerned with 'here and now'. I was diagnosed in January 1996. The diagnosing doctor told me that he believed my type of MS to be remitting/relapsing (RRMS) and what that would more than likely entail for me. I remember in the days following my diagnosis I bought every book on the topic of MS that I could find in town. I then went home and promptly threw them all under the bed! Looking back, I think I was just trying to make sure that I at least physically ‘possessed’ as much knowledge as I could (I guess I was trying to get a sense of ownership over this unexpected addition to my life). But then I simultaneously created my own little ‘Pandora’s Box’ in my room, never to be opened for fear of what it might contain. Coincidentally, my MS went into remission at that exact time, allowing me to develop a healthy denial about it. [Aside: If I remember correctly, I think I never actually read those books. In 1998, two years after the start of my remission, MS returned with one hell of a relapse, going so far as to give me a permanent limp in my right leg. Now, in 2018, I can say that I believe I’ve learned that attitude can be at least just as important as knowledge. In my opinion, there really is a lot to be said for that old chestnut, P ositive M ental A ttitude. Over 20 years since my diagnosis, I’ve developed two new conditions, both neuralgias and both facial/cranial extreme nerve pains. One is called Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN) and the other is Cluster Headaches (CH). Nobody told me beforehand that I was going to develop these. There was no medical prognosis, best guesses, psychics, witch doctors, NOTHING . I just suddenly acquired the conditions and I had to quickly learn how to deal with them. And I’m still learning how to deal with them. Again looking back, a doctor or neurosurgeon or whoever, might have hinted TN and CH might be on the cards but personally, I reckon that that would have been a potential disaster. I say this considering the proven effect that fear and stress can have on a newly diagnosed person with MS. At the end of the day, there’s only so much one can do about the future. Right now the most important thing for me is dealing with the here and now. 	1	1	MS|Ireland|::|Helping|Everyone|Affected|by|Multiple|Sclerosis	MS|Ireland|::|.|Helping|Everyone|Affected|by|Multiple|Sclerosis|.|Thursday|August|16|2018|10:16|AM|.|This|week|Fergal|Hughes|wonders|about|what|the|future|holds|for|him|in|terms|of|his|MS|...|and|realises|that|he|is|more|concerned|with|'|here|and|now|'|.|I|was|diagnosed|in|January|1996|.|The|diagnosing|doctor|told|me|that|he|believed|my|type|of|MS|to|be|remitting|/|relapsing|(|RRMS|)|and|what|that|would|more|than|likely|entail|for|me|.|I|remember|in|the|days|following|my|diagnosis|I|bought|every|book|on|the|topic|of|MS|that|I|could|find|in|town|.|I|then|went|home|and|promptly|threw|them|all|under|the|bed|!|Looking|back|,|I|think|I|was|just|trying|to|make|sure|that|I|at|least|physically|‘|possessed|’|as|much|knowledge|as|I|could|(|I|guess|I|was|trying|to|get|a|sense|of|ownership|over|this|unexpected|addition|to|my|life|)|.|But|then|I|simultaneously|created|my|own|little|‘|Pandora|’|s|Box|’|in|my|room|,|never|to|be|opened|for|fear|of|what|it|might|contain|.|Coincidentally|,|my|MS|went|into|remission|at|that|exact|time|,|allowing|me|to|develop|a|healthy|denial|about|it|.|[|Aside|:|If|I|remember|correctly|,|I|think|I|never|actually|read|those|books|.|In|1998|,|two|years|after|the|start|of|my|remission|,|MS|returned|with|one|hell|of|a|relapse|,|going|so|far|as|to|give|me|a|permanent|limp|in|my|right|leg|.|Now|,|in|2018|,|I|can|say|that|I|believe|I|’|ve|learned|that|attitude|can|be|at|least|just|as|important|as|knowledge|.|In|my|opinion|,|there|really|is|a|lot|to|be|said|for|that|old|chestnut|,|P|ositive|M|ental|A|ttitude|.|Over|20|years|since|my|diagnosis|,|I|’|ve|developed|two|new|conditions|,|both|neuralgias|and|both|facial|/|cranial|extreme|nerve|pains|.|One|is|called|Trigeminal|Neuralgia|(|TN|)|and|the|other|is|Cluster|Headaches|(|CH|)|.|Nobody|told|me|beforehand|that|I|was|going|to|develop|these|.|There|was|no|medical|prognosis|,|best|guesses|,|psychics|,|witch|doctors|,|NOTHING|.|I|just|suddenly|acquired|the|conditions|and|I|had|to|quickly|learn|how|to|deal|with|them|.|And|I|’|m|still|learning|how|to|deal|with|them|.|Again|looking|back|,|a|doctor|or|neurosurgeon|or|whoever|,|might|have|hinted|TN|and|CH|might|be|on|the|cards|but|personally|,|I|reckon|that|that|would|have|been|a|potential|disaster|.|I|say|this|considering|the|proven|effect|that|fear|and|stress|can|have|on|a|newly|diagnosed|person|with|MS|.|At|the|end|of|the|day|,|there|’|s|only|so|much|one|can|do|about|the|future|.|Right|now|the|most|important|thing|for|me|is|dealing|with|the|here|and|now|.

Aug 11, 2018 9:23 PM. km, What have you thought about their idea of a brain biopsy? Do you think it is something you would want to do? Have you done the reading about it? What are you terrified about? Has anyone suggested an alternative? like treating it as if it is ms instead of a tumor? Have they done a lumbar puncture? Sep 09, 2018 10:23 PM. Hello I hope that this response finds you well on April 30 2018, I went to the emergency departmenr with lots of vision in my right eye and it’s pretty severe gate disturbance they found a lesion on my brain and set me up for an MRI the next morning and a neurosurgeon I met with the neurosurgeon for days after my MRI and he advised me that I had an in operable brain tumor he gave me 1 million things that it could be but the one that he kept coming back to was glioblastoma The initial pathology finding at time of surgery was Glioblastoma and I was told I had 3 months to live. however four days later he called me at home and told me I do not have a Glioblastoma, I did not have any kind of Brain Cancer. I was told I have a single tumefactive inflammatory lesion. He referred me to a neurologist. I had very high dose IV steroid treatment followed by extended oral taper dose of prednisone. I am waiting for my three month follow-up MRI in eight days. I went back to work after two months. am anxious to find out what the results are please let me know how you are doing. 	1	1	Discussions|-|MS|Connection	Aug|11|,|2018|9:12|PM|.|Tumefactive|MS|*|.|Aug|11|,|2018|9:23|PM|.|km|,|What|have|you|thought|about|their|idea|of|a|brain|biopsy|?|Do|you|think|it|is|something|you|would|want|to|do|?|Have|you|done|the|reading|about|it|?|What|are|you|terrified|about|?|Has|anyone|suggested|an|alternative|?|like|treating|it|as|if|it|is|ms|instead|of|a|tumor|?|Have|they|done|a|lumbar|puncture|?|Sep|09|,|2018|10:23|PM|.|Hello|I|hope|that|this|response|finds|you|well|on|April|30|2018|,|I|went|to|the|emergency|departmenr|with|lots|of|vision|in|my|right|eye|and|it|’|s|pretty|severe|gate|disturbance|they|found|a|lesion|on|my|brain|and|set|me|up|for|an|MRI|the|next|morning|and|a|neurosurgeon|I|met|with|the|neurosurgeon|for|days|after|my|MRI|and|he|advised|me|that|I|had|an|in|operable|brain|tumor|he|gave|me|1|million|things|that|it|could|be|but|the|one|that|he|kept|coming|back|to|was|glioblastoma|The|initial|pathology|finding|at|time|of|surgery|was|Glioblastoma|and|I|was|told|I|had|3|months|to|live|.|however|four|days|later|he|called|me|at|home|and|told|me|I|do|not|have|a|Glioblastoma|,|I|did|not|have|any|kind|of|Brain|Cancer|.|I|was|told|I|have|a|single|tumefactive|inflammatory|lesion|.|He|referred|me|to|a|neurologist|.|I|had|very|high|dose|IV|steroid|treatment|followed|by|extended|oral|taper|dose|of|prednisone|.|I|am|waiting|for|my|three|month|follow-up|MRI|in|eight|days|.|I|went|back|to|work|after|two|months|.|am|anxious|to|find|out|what|the|results|are|please|let|me|know|how|you|are|doing|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531849332486994/Exosomes:-Are-They-All-Alike-and-Why-Does-it-Matter?	Exosomes: Are They All Alike and Why Does it Matter?	Sponsored Content by Wyatt Technology Corp. Aug 1 2018. In this interview, Haiying Zhang , Assistant Professor of Cell and Development Biology from the Department of Pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medicine talks to News – Medical about the importance of Exosomes. What are exosomes and why is it important to understand differences between them? Exosomes are nanosized extracellular membrane vesicles of endosomal origin secreted by most cell types if not all, including cancer cells. These membrane vesicles carry an array of biologically functional macromolecules, including proteins, genetic material (e.g., mRNAs, miRNAs, lnRNAs, DNA), metabolites and lipids, which are selectively recruited and packaged into exosomes. Exosomes can horizontally transfer their cargo to recipient cells, thereby acting as vehicles of intercellular communication in both physiological and pathological conditions. It is evident that the differences in size, surface molecules and chemistry, and mechanical properties among exosome subpopulations all collectively contribute to their biodistribution and systemic functions in vivo . More advanced characterization of molecular signatures associated with each subset of exosomes will clearly facilitate the identification of potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for cancer progression and other pathogeneses. Such knowledge will also provide rationales for developing exosome-based therapeutic means in clinical trials. Image Credit: Shutterstock/paulista. What are the challenges associated with differentiating exosomes? Cells secret a variety of nanoparticles/microparticles with different sizes. However, traditional means cannot separate exosomes from other populations of particles efficiently due to technical challenges. Therefore, the isolated exosomes constitute a heterogeneous population and this has hindered our understanding of their biogenesis, molecular composition, biodistribution and functions in vivo , and further translational applications. Please outline the analytical method used in your recent research , to isolate and identify extracellular vesicles. To identify and isolate different small extracellular vesicles/nanoparticles, we employed the asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) analytic method in conjugation with online detection of static and dynamic light scattering and UV absorbance, and an array of different downstream, offline analyses for biophysical properties (such as transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, zeta potential, and stiffness) and molecular composition characterization (such as proteomic mass spectrometry (MS), lipidomic MS, N -glycomic MS, and genetic material profiling). What are the unique features of FFF -DLS that allowed you to separate the particles and group the exosomes? The AF4 exhibits unique capability to separate nanoparticles and has been widely utilized to characterize nanoparticles and polymers in pharmaceutics and various biological macromolecules, protein complexes and viruses. The dynamic range of AF4 separation allowed us not just to separate distinct exosome subsets but also to identify a novel nanoparticle population which we termed “exomeres”. The online DLS measurement provides the real-time hydrodynamic size measurement of fractionated nanoparticles. This allows us to recognize different nanoparticle subpopulations in a given sample and guides the grouping of fractions based on this information. How are the 3 exosomal groups that you identified distinguished from each other? By employing AF4, we have identified two distinct exosome subpopulations (large exosome vesicles, Exo-L, 90-120 nm in diameter; small exosome vesicles, Exo-S, 60-80 nm in diameter) and have discovered a novel, non-membranous nanovesicle population termed “exomeres” (<50 nm with an average of 35 nm in diameter). These nanoparticles are remarkably distinct in their biophysical properties such as morphology, size, zeta potential, and stiffness. They each contain unique proteins that are related to specific pathways, such as glycolysis and mTOR signaling for exomeres, endosomal function and secretion pathways for Exo-S, and mitotic spindle and IL-2/STAT5 signaling pathways for Exo-L. Specifically, Exomere proteomic profiling revealed an enrichment in metabolic enzymes and hypoxia, microtubule and coagulation proteins. Furthermore, each particle subset contained a distinct N -glycosylation profile and lipid composition, and showed cell type-dependent genetic diversity in DNA and RNA prevalence. Importantly, these nanoparticles demonstrated distinct organ biodistribution patterns in animal models, suggesting their functional differences in vivo . Focussing on Exomeres, how did FFF-DLS excel in your research compared to traditional means used to isolate exosomes? Traditional methods such as differential ultracentrifugation usually cannot separate exomeres from exosomes efficiently. In contrast, FFF-DLS can not only result in the separation of exomeres from the other subsets of exosomes, but also provide the real-time measurement of the hydrodynamic size of fractionated nanoparticles, facilitating the identification/characterization and downstream fraction collection and analysis of the fractioned samples. Please outline the Wyatt Technology instrumentation that helped you with your research. Why did you choose these products? The Wyatt instruments we have include 1) the short AF4 channel, the central piece within which the nanoparticles are separated; 2) The ECLIPSE AF4, which controls the flow of AF4; 3) The Dawn Heleos II equipped with QELS at 100° position, which are online multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) monitors, respectively. What are the benefits of combining FFF and DLS as seen in these products? The separation of nanoparticles into mono-disperse populations by FFF enables the accurate measurement of the hydrodynamic size of fractionated nanoparticles by DLS monitors. Such online measurement of the nanoparticle size allows immediately the identification/characterization of the nanoparticle composition in a given sample. This also facilitates grouping nanoparticle fractions with similar properties for further downstream analysis. What future role do you see for separation and characterization technologies from Wyatt Technology in the field of extracellular vesicles? I would like to see 1) the development of AF4 system suitable for large scale preparation of nanoparticles, and 2) further separation of nanoparticles based on other biophysical/biochemical properties such as charge and specific molecular moieties carried on the surface of the nanoparticles. Where can readers find more information? As well as scientific research publications, the Wyatt Light Scattering University provides excellent workshops/lessons for understanding the basics of light scattering and AF4. The application scientists at Wyatt are a great team for consultation for more information as well https://www.wyatt.com/. About Haiying Zhang.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702046763716916019/My-mom:-the-fiercest-competitor-I-know---Blog---MS-Society-of-Canada	My mom: the fiercest competitor I know - Blog - MS Society of Canada	Guest post by: Christine Sinclair. When I was a young girl, I remember my mom started using a cane. I never understood why. It wasn’t until the first time I saw her cry that the answers began to unfold in front of me. I was no older than 12 when I found out my mom was living with multiple sclerosis (MS). When you’re a kid, your parents are indestructible, and that’s what my mom was to me. But as years went by, I watched MS chip away at aspects of her life, and her fight against the chronic disease became tougher and tougher. You see, my mom was an athlete, just like me. When I was growing up, she was my head coach for soccer, and as I progressed, she became the president of the club that my brother and I played at. She played all kinds of sports – soccer, track, baseball, water skiing, you name it – and coming from a family of athletes, it was routine for us to go to the park every week and play outside. With her MS, she’s been forced to adapt her lifestyle. As a fellow athlete, it breaks my heart to watch my mom, who was so physically active, over the years, seeing that slowly stripped away from her. I know that if she could, she would love to bring her grandkids to the park. My mom was always a fierce competitor, but never had I seen her battle a hurdle as immense as MS, where her biggest opponent is herself. Because of that, it took her some time to come to grips with her situation. I don’t think you’re ever okay with MS, but accepting the reality and making the best of that has been the biggest journey for her, and the rest of my family. Today, my mom is still the strongest person I know and my number one champion. She currently resides in a care home, which can be challenging at times. Cognitively, she’s still my mom – friendly, social, and as sharp as ever – but physically, she’s placed in a facility where she is 20 years younger than everyone else. Being the outgoing person that she is, she struggles with the lack of human interaction she has at her home. She’s even become friends with the employees. Naturally, she loves having visitors, so our big family goes to see her every opportunity we get. Some of my teammates visit her too. Although she lives in Vancouver and I’m in Portland, my mom’s journey with MS affects me every day. Just knowing what she’s constantly going through weighs heavy on my heart. But my mom always worked to not let her disease affect my life – career, or otherwise. She encouraged me to go away for university and always inspired me to follow my dreams of becoming a professional soccer player. In the past few years, my priorities have shifted. Soccer is still my passion, but family has become ever so important to me. Whenever I have a couple of days off, I drive from Portland, Oregon to B.C. to spend time with my family. If you ask me, the time couldn’t be better spent. I wish people knew how debilitating it is for a person living with MS. The lack of options available for people living with it, such as the ability to work, is astounding. These are amazing and inspiring people who deserve all the opportunities in the world, and they just need to be given a chance. I hope that by getting involved in Burgers to Beat MS , I can help spread that message. I took on this campaign to step out of my comfort zone, which is on the soccer field. I want to be a part of something bigger than just a game. With the impact that MS has had on my family, I feel like I am finally at a place in my life where I know I can help make a difference. MS hits close to home, and I want to do everything I can to help people, just like my mom, enjoy life to the fullest. Burgers to Beat MS Day will take place August 16 where $2 from every Teen Burger® will go to the MS Society of Canada. Help Christine Sinclair and others who are affected by multiple sclerosis by supporting the campaign and bringing us one step closer to finding a cure for the chronic disease. 	1	1	My|mom|:|the|fiercest|competitor|I|know|-|Blog|-|MS|Society|of|Canada	Guest|post|by|:|Christine|Sinclair|.|When|I|was|a|young|girl|,|I|remember|my|mom|started|using|a|cane|.|I|never|understood|why|.|It|wasn|’|t|until|the|first|time|I|saw|her|cry|that|the|answers|began|to|unfold|in|front|of|me|.|I|was|no|older|than|12|when|I|found|out|my|mom|was|living|with|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|.|When|you|’|re|a|kid|,|your|parents|are|indestructible|,|and|that|’|s|what|my|mom|was|to|me|.|But|as|years|went|by|,|I|watched|MS|chip|away|at|aspects|of|her|life|,|and|her|fight|against|the|chronic|disease|became|tougher|and|tougher|.|You|see|,|my|mom|was|an|athlete|,|just|like|me|.|When|I|was|growing|up|,|she|was|my|head|coach|for|soccer|,|and|as|I|progressed|,|she|became|the|president|of|the|club|that|my|brother|and|I|played|at|.|She|played|all|kinds|of|sports|–|soccer|,|track|,|baseball|,|water|skiing|,|you|name|it|–|and|coming|from|a|family|of|athletes|,|it|was|routine|for|us|to|go|to|the|park|every|week|and|play|outside|.|With|her|MS|,|she|’|s|been|forced|to|adapt|her|lifestyle|.|As|a|fellow|athlete|,|it|breaks|my|heart|to|watch|my|mom|,|who|was|so|physically|active|,|over|the|years|,|seeing|that|slowly|stripped|away|from|her|.|I|know|that|if|she|could|,|she|would|love|to|bring|her|grandkids|to|the|park|.|My|mom|was|always|a|fierce|competitor|,|but|never|had|I|seen|her|battle|a|hurdle|as|immense|as|MS|,|where|her|biggest|opponent|is|herself|.|Because|of|that|,|it|took|her|some|time|to|come|to|grips|with|her|situation|.|I|don|’|t|think|you|’|re|ever|okay|with|MS|,|but|accepting|the|reality|and|making|the|best|of|that|has|been|the|biggest|journey|for|her|,|and|the|rest|of|my|family|.|Today|,|my|mom|is|still|the|strongest|person|I|know|and|my|number|one|champion|.|She|currently|resides|in|a|care|home|,|which|can|be|challenging|at|times|.|Cognitively|,|she|’|s|still|my|mom|–|friendly|,|social|,|and|as|sharp|as|ever|–|but|physically|,|she|’|s|placed|in|a|facility|where|she|is|20|years|younger|than|everyone|else|.|Being|the|outgoing|person|that|she|is|,|she|struggles|with|the|lack|of|human|interaction|she|has|at|her|home|.|She|’|s|even|become|friends|with|the|employees|.|Naturally|,|she|loves|having|visitors|,|so|our|big|family|goes|to|see|her|every|opportunity|we|get|.|Some|of|my|teammates|visit|her|too|.|Although|she|lives|in|Vancouver|and|I|’|m|in|Portland|,|my|mom|’|s|journey|with|MS|affects|me|every|day|.|Just|knowing|what|she|’|s|constantly|going|through|weighs|heavy|on|my|heart|.|But|my|mom|always|worked|to|not|let|her|disease|affect|my|life|–|career|,|or|otherwise|.|She|encouraged|me|to|go|away|for|university|and|always|inspired|me|to|follow|my|dreams|of|becoming|a|professional|soccer|player|.|In|the|past|few|years|,|my|priorities|have|shifted|.|Soccer|is|still|my|passion|,|but|family|has|become|ever|so|important|to|me|.|Whenever|I|have|a|couple|of|days|off|,|I|drive|from|Portland|,|Oregon|to|B|.|C|.|to|spend|time|with|my|family|.|If|you|ask|me|,|the|time|couldn|’|t|be|better|spent|.|I|wish|people|knew|how|debilitating|it|is|for|a|person|living|with|MS|.|The|lack|of|options|available|for|people|living|with|it|,|such|as|the|ability|to|work|,|is|astounding|.|These|are|amazing|and|inspiring|people|who|deserve|all|the|opportunities|in|the|world|,|and|they|just|need|to|be|given|a|chance|.|I|hope|that|by|getting|involved|in|Burgers|to|Beat|MS|,|I|can|help|spread|that|message|.|I|took|on|this|campaign|to|step|out|of|my|comfort|zone|,|which|is|on|the|soccer|field|.|I|want|to|be|a|part|of|something|bigger|than|just|a|game|.|With|the|impact|that|MS|has|had|on|my|family|,|I|feel|like|I|am|finally|at|a|place|in|my|life|where|I|know|I|can|help|make|a|difference|.|MS|hits|close|to|home|,|and|I|want|to|do|everything|I|can|to|help|people|,|just|like|my|mom|,|enjoy|life|to|the|fullest|.|Burgers|to|Beat|MS|Day|will|take|place|August|16|where|$|2|from|every|Teen|Burger|®|will|go|to|the|MS|Society|of|Canada|.|Help|Christine|Sinclair|and|others|who|are|affected|by|multiple|sclerosis|by|supporting|the|campaign|and|bringing|us|one|step|closer|to|finding|a|cure|for|the|chronic|disease|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4724107214973392528/African-Americans-Show-Better-Adherence-and-Satisfaction-with-Gilenya-Than-Injectable-DMTs,-Phase-4-Study-Finds	African-Americans Show Better Adherence and Satisfaction with Gilenya Than Injectable DMTs, Phase 4 Study Finds	JULY 30, 2018 by: Jose Marques Lopes, PhD. African-Americans with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) show higher adherence and greater satisfaction when treated with oral Gilenya ( fingolimod , by Novartis ) than with injectable therapies, according to a new study. The research, “ Treatment retention on fingolimod compared with injectable multiple sclerosis therapies in African-American patients: A subgroup analysis of a randomized phase 4 study ,” was published in the journal. Although the efficacy and safety of injectable disease-modifying therapies (iDMTs) used as first-line treatments for relapsing forms of MS are well-established, patients are also known from real-world studies to often discontinue using them and become non-adherent to these therapies. Research has shown that poor treatment retention, which includes adherence to and persistence in use over the long term, is key for better outcomes in MS. To optimize treatment, clinicians need information on the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and convenience of therapies in specific patient groups. Studies show that African-American MS patients can have a more aggressive disease course than Caucasians, including a greater likelihood of disability accumulation. Although not widely studied for MS, this patient population in diseases like hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma are known to have lower treatment retention rates than those of other patient groups. The Phase 4 PREFER MS study ( NCT01623596 ), sponsored by Novartis, randomized about 850 RRMS patients ages 8–65 to oral Gilenya or an injectable DMT. Its goal was to better understand retention to treatment with Gilenya in specific populations. All enrolled had either never taken any iDMT previously or only one such medication; patients allowed one treatment switch after 12 weeks or earlier for safety or efficacy reasons. 	1	0	African-Americans|Show|Better|Adherence|and|Satisfaction|with|Gilenya|Than|Injectable|DMTs|,|Phase|4|Study|Finds	JULY|30|,|2018|by|:|Jose|Marques|Lopes|,|PhD|.|African-Americans|with|relapsing|–|remitting|multiple|sclerosis|(|RRMS|)|show|higher|adherence|and|greater|satisfaction|when|treated|with|oral|Gilenya|(|fingolimod|,|by|Novartis|)|than|with|injectable|therapies|,|according|to|a|new|study|.|The|research|,|“|Treatment|retention|on|fingolimod|compared|with|injectable|multiple|sclerosis|therapies|in|African-American|patients|:|A|subgroup|analysis|of|a|randomized|phase|4|study|,|”|was|published|in|the|journal|.|Although|the|efficacy|and|safety|of|injectable|disease-modifying|therapies|(|iDMTs|)|used|as|first-line|treatments|for|relapsing|forms|of|MS|are|well-established|,|patients|are|also|known|from|real-world|studies|to|often|discontinue|using|them|and|become|non-adherent|to|these|therapies|.|Research|has|shown|that|poor|treatment|retention|,|which|includes|adherence|to|and|persistence|in|use|over|the|long|term|,|is|key|for|better|outcomes|in|MS|.|To|optimize|treatment|,|clinicians|need|information|on|the|efficacy|,|safety|,|tolerability|,|and|convenience|of|therapies|in|specific|patient|groups|.|Studies|show|that|African-American|MS|patients|can|have|a|more|aggressive|disease|course|than|Caucasians|,|including|a|greater|likelihood|of|disability|accumulation|.|Although|not|widely|studied|for|MS|,|this|patient|population|in|diseases|like|hypertension|,|rheumatoid|arthritis|and|asthma|are|known|to|have|lower|treatment|retention|rates|than|those|of|other|patient|groups|.|The|Phase|4|PREFER|MS|study|(|NCT|01623596|)|,|sponsored|by|Novartis|,|randomized|about|850|RRMS|patients|ages|8|–|65|to|oral|Gilenya|or|an|injectable|DMT|.|Its|goal|was|to|better|understand|retention|to|treatment|with|Gilenya|in|specific|populations|.|All|enrolled|had|either|never|taken|any|iDMT|previously|or|only|one|such|medication|;|patients|allowed|one|treatment|switch|after|12|weeks|or|earlier|for|safety|or|efficacy|reasons|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693250054066254007/Rise-Up---MS-Connection	Rise Up - MS Connection	Resilience is the capacity to recover from difficulties and finding your strength within. Where do I begin? I’m 39 years old and have been through my share of difficulties. If I’ve learned anything, it’s that no matter what happens, you have to get back up and fight all the curve balls that this life throws you. 2005 and 2006 were bittersweet life changing years for me. I tragically lost my 2-year-old son in June 2005. To say I was devastated would be an understatement. Are there any words to describe that kind of pain? Before the shock of it all could settle in, I unexpectedly became pregnant with my daughter. I didn’t even know how to feel. In May 2006 on Mother’s Day, I was blessed with my daughter and immediately felt the warmth of her love. I felt I was given a second chance in life. She was my anchor, and she saved me in so many ways. Life seemed to be moving forward. I had been hired at a new job, and I was set to begin that month. But I woke up one day in early October and noticed that I had numbness in my torso area from my spine to my navel. I didn’t think much of it. I just figured it was a pinched nerve or something. I waited to see if it would subside, it didn’t. I called my physician, and she ordered an MRI and a neurologist appointment. I was confident that it would be something that would resolve itself, but after a second MRI, the neurologist told me what he was about to tell me would change my life forever. He broke the devastating news I had MS. I was in shock. I arrived at my mother’s house and when I saw her holding my baby, I broke down crying. I was so scared. What would I do now? Will my daughter grow up without her mother? Why me? So much loss, my life was falling apart. All hope was lost once again. I must have Googled everything about this disease and had so many questions. I learned that this disease affects everyone differently, and there was no one way to deal with this. I just had to bounce back and be stronger than ever—not only for me but for my family. I was determined to not have MS control my life. And that’s just what I did—I moved on, I had no choice. I was learning to live this new life, and I was getting back into a routine when, once again, that cringing familiar feeling was back. Now it was my leg and other side of my torso area, I had vision changes, and the fatigue was overwhelming. I went back to that dark place where I felt all hope was lost once again. I was sick, I couldn’t do much and had to leave work. I couldn’t handle it all: a one-year-old, a stressful job, steroids, injections. I needed to be rescued. I prayed for some answers and clarity. I was depressed, 280 pounds, a little over five foot one, 27, and in an abusive relationship. I was so angry, fed up and tired. I felt cheated. I desperately needed some change in my life, and that is what I did… again. I bought a house on my own. I left my toxic relationship, changed my diet and started to exercise lightly. It was then I began to understand the meaning of resiliency in my own life. I’ve learned that this life is like a yo-yo—you always have to prepare for bad things to happen. But I can reassure you that it will be okay. My story isn’t linear. Every time I thought I was on a positive trajectory, I’ve been shot down. It’s been marked by ups and downs, and it will surely be like that forever. I struggle every day, but I won’t give up. I know I have to be resilient, be a role model for my daughter and others going through similar problems, never lose faith, and most of all, hope. 	1	1	Rise|Up|-|MS|Connection	Resilience|is|the|capacity|to|recover|from|difficulties|and|finding|your|strength|within|.|Where|do|I|begin|?|I|’|m|39|years|old|and|have|been|through|my|share|of|difficulties|.|If|I|’|ve|learned|anything|,|it|’|s|that|no|matter|what|happens|,|you|have|to|get|back|up|and|fight|all|the|curve|balls|that|this|life|throws|you|.|2005|and|2006|were|bittersweet|life|changing|years|for|me|.|I|tragically|lost|my|2|-|year-old|son|in|June|2005|.|To|say|I|was|devastated|would|be|an|understatement|.|Are|there|any|words|to|describe|that|kind|of|pain|?|Before|the|shock|of|it|all|could|settle|in|,|I|unexpectedly|became|pregnant|with|my|daughter|.|I|didn|’|t|even|know|how|to|feel|.|In|May|2006|on|Mother|’|s|Day|,|I|was|blessed|with|my|daughter|and|immediately|felt|the|warmth|of|her|love|.|I|felt|I|was|given|a|second|chance|in|life|.|She|was|my|anchor|,|and|she|saved|me|in|so|many|ways|.|Life|seemed|to|be|moving|forward|.|I|had|been|hired|at|a|new|job|,|and|I|was|set|to|begin|that|month|.|But|I|woke|up|one|day|in|early|October|and|noticed|that|I|had|numbness|in|my|torso|area|from|my|spine|to|my|navel|.|I|didn|’|t|think|much|of|it|.|I|just|figured|it|was|a|pinched|nerve|or|something|.|I|waited|to|see|if|it|would|subside|,|it|didn|’|t|.|I|called|my|physician|,|and|she|ordered|an|MRI|and|a|neurologist|appointment|.|I|was|confident|that|it|would|be|something|that|would|resolve|itself|,|but|after|a|second|MRI|,|the|neurologist|told|me|what|he|was|about|to|tell|me|would|change|my|life|forever|.|He|broke|the|devastating|news|I|had|MS|.|I|was|in|shock|.|I|arrived|at|my|mother|’|s|house|and|when|I|saw|her|holding|my|baby|,|I|broke|down|crying|.|I|was|so|scared|.|What|would|I|do|now|?|Will|my|daughter|grow|up|without|her|mother|?|Why|me|?|So|much|loss|,|my|life|was|falling|apart|.|All|hope|was|lost|once|again|.|I|must|have|Googled|everything|about|this|disease|and|had|so|many|questions|.|I|learned|that|this|disease|affects|everyone|differently|,|and|there|was|no|one|way|to|deal|with|this|.|I|just|had|to|bounce|back|and|be|stronger|than|ever|—|not|only|for|me|but|for|my|family|.|I|was|determined|to|not|have|MS|control|my|life|.|And|that|’|s|just|what|I|did|—|I|moved|on|,|I|had|no|choice|.|I|was|learning|to|live|this|new|life|,|and|I|was|getting|back|into|a|routine|when|,|once|again|,|that|cringing|familiar|feeling|was|back|.|Now|it|was|my|leg|and|other|side|of|my|torso|area|,|I|had|vision|changes|,|and|the|fatigue|was|overwhelming|.|I|went|back|to|that|dark|place|where|I|felt|all|hope|was|lost|once|again|.|I|was|sick|,|I|couldn|’|t|do|much|and|had|to|leave|work|.|I|couldn|’|t|handle|it|all|:|a|one-year-old|,|a|stressful|job|,|steroids|,|injections|.|I|needed|to|be|rescued|.|I|prayed|for|some|answers|and|clarity|.|I|was|depressed|,|280|pounds|,|a|little|over|five|foot|one|,|27|,|and|in|an|abusive|relationship|.|I|was|so|angry|,|fed|up|and|tired|.|I|felt|cheated|.|I|desperately|needed|some|change|in|my|life|,|and|that|is|what|I|did|…|again|.|I|bought|a|house|on|my|own|.|I|left|my|toxic|relationship|,|changed|my|diet|and|started|to|exercise|lightly|.|It|was|then|I|began|to|understand|the|meaning|of|resiliency|in|my|own|life|.|I|’|ve|learned|that|this|life|is|like|a|yo-yo|—|you|always|have|to|prepare|for|bad|things|to|happen|.|But|I|can|reassure|you|that|it|will|be|okay|.|My|story|isn|’|t|linear|.|Every|time|I|thought|I|was|on|a|positive|trajectory|,|I|’|ve|been|shot|down|.|It|’|s|been|marked|by|ups|and|downs|,|and|it|will|surely|be|like|that|forever|.|I|struggle|every|day|,|but|I|won|’|t|give|up|.|I|know|I|have|to|be|resilient|,|be|a|role|model|for|my|daughter|and|others|going|through|similar|problems|,|never|lose|faith|,|and|most|of|all|,|hope|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531525280027207/MS-Ireland--::-Helping-Everyone-Affected-by-Multiple-Sclerosis	MS Ireland  :: Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis	MS Ireland  ::. Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. But You Look So Good. Thursday July 26 2018 11:12 AM. ‘But you look so good’…. MS & Me blogger Niall McGahon shares his thoughts and reaction on hearing this compliment. “But you look so good….” For some, this expression can be one of the most frustrating things to hear when you have MS. For me, it is simply someone paying me a compliment and my immediate reply is “Thanks a million…”. Personally, the most frustrating aspect of having MS - is having this progressive illness . No two days are the same nor do they have any predictability. This is where I have tried to take back control of my life and put a bit of manners on MS! Now this was by no means an instantaneous migration and did not happen overnight. It was and still is difficult to make such major lifestyle changes and I am continuously learning each and every day. Many times, of course it does get in the way, or rather my right leg gets in the way of my left leg. Suddenly the footpath and I are about to become very close friends! But like all things you learn to live with and give yourself the best possible chance of limiting the relapses through exercise, major dietary change, meditation and focusing on what I can do and not on what I may or may not be able to do in the future. I follow the OMS program for all of this. The great sports phycologist, Dr Bob Rotella has a simple concept used for golf of “staying in the present”. These golfers play their next shot until they run out of holes and then add up their score. I have taken this from my golf and tried to apply it to my illness, simply take each day as it comes and deal with that day. The rest of the days are, for the most part outside of my control. Since being diagnosed with MS in 2014 and having many experiences since, I have become acutely aware of how well I am in the grand scheme of human health. I have been in hospital for various treatments and have seen people who have much harder crosses to bear than me. So as a result, I am trying to make myself more aware of when someone is paying me a compliment. I have no idea what that person is going through, yet they have taken the time to think about me and what I am going through by paying me a compliment. The correct thing to do is simply say thank you. If you can add to peoples’ knowledge of MS along the way through conversation, then brilliant. The greater the understanding of what a person with MS goes through daily, the better. You may be in pain, you may be heavily fatigued, and you may not be in a very good emotional place. What I have learnt over the last 4 years is that the person saying that you look good could be in the very same place but for a totally different reason, so saying thank you is sometimes best for all.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531446148141321/MS-Fatigue-med??????	MS Fatigue med??????	Hi there. I was diagnosed 8 years this September. My main symptoms are extreme fatigue and migraines with a hint of optic neuritis on occasion plus bladder issues. The fatigue is my big issue. I tend to feel normal and do errands then clearly I did too much and feel like I went from 90% to 1% energy in 2 minutes. I try to just do the bare minimum errand wise and try not to over do it but its hard. My doctor gave me a script for Adderall but I was uncomfortable with taking that on a daily basis. I already don't sleep well due to the bladder issues being worse at night time. I found on another blog a med called Advanced Ambrotose made by Mannatech. Got it off Amazon recently, and just started it today. Worst cade it does nothing but if I could even just have a little more energy that would be great. My question is, has anyone tried this med before? What was your experience with it? Did it help with any of your symptoms? Did it help with fatigue at all?? Thanks for the help!!!! 	1	1	MS|Fatigue|med|?|?|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4708182355239704453/Potential-new-MS-drug-could-regenerate-myelin	Potential new MS drug could regenerate myelin	"Published Thursday 19 July 2018. New research could lead to treatments for multiple sclerosis that regenerate myelin, the fatty coating that insulates nerve fibers and protects signals between brain cells. Scientists from the University at Buffalo in New York find that the receptor muscarinic type 3 (M3R) is a ""key regulator"" of remyelination, which is the process that replenishes lost myelin. M3R is found on the surface of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), the precursors to the cells that make myelin. A receptor is a cell-surface protein that triggers certain cell functions when it encounters and binds to a matching unique molecule. The scientists showed that blocking M3R increased remyelination in mice that had human OPCs transplanted into them. Senior study author Fraser J. Sim, an associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology, and his colleagues report their findings in a paper now published in The Journal of Neuroscience . As myelin is destroyed, it forms lesions that weaken signals that travel along the nerve fibers, leading to disrupted communication between brain cells. Scientists have learned that the disease also damages the nerve cells themselves.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693241878567248389/PT-for-back-pain	PT for back pain	Hi again, Five weeks ago I woke up with low back, outer hip and thigh pain. I could barely walk. I saw a dr. but not my regular one as she had the day off. He said it's Sciatica and to use Aspercreme. Yeah, that didn't work so I saw another dr.(my regular doc off again) at same clinic who sent me to PT, after an x-ray showed spine and hips ok. The therapist did all kinds of tests and said that it's not Sciatica and my spine seems fine, no signs of herniated discs. She said I have muscle weakness and have to strengthen my core to help with that. She also checked my reflexes and I nearly kicked her!!! I was told to warn any doctors that do this test so they don't get kicked, lol. She was so nice and friendly! Anyway, three days later I awoke and all pain was gone! It had left just the same as it arrived! I saw her again a few days later and she was as perplexed as I was! She had me do some stretches and we both agreed it would be silly to keep seeing her when I had no pain at all. These symptoms just keep getting weirder. I see an MS specialist next week in Pittsburg, and his reviews sound promising. He listens carefully and is patient and writes down notes and gives you a copy. I'm not getting my hopes up, but it sure would be nice if he can figure this all out. At the very least I hope he doesn't just drop me like the others and helps me find an answer. I will update when and if I get any answers. Thanks so much to all of you on this site. You are all so kind and helpful to all of us who are scared, worried and confused. After a while all our individual stories probably sound the same to you, but you still help us to feel better. 	1	1	PT|for|back|pain	Hi|again|,|Five|weeks|ago|I|woke|up|with|low|back|,|outer|hip|and|thigh|pain|.|I|could|barely|walk|.|I|saw|a|dr|.|but|not|my|regular|one|as|she|had|the|day|off|.|He|said|it's|Sciatica|and|to|use|Aspercreme|.|Yeah|,|that|didn't|work|so|I|saw|another|dr|.|(|my|regular|doc|off|again|)|at|same|clinic|who|sent|me|to|PT|,|after|an|x-ray|showed|spine|and|hips|ok|.|The|therapist|did|all|kinds|of|tests|and|said|that|it's|not|Sciatica|and|my|spine|seems|fine|,|no|signs|of|herniated|discs|.|She|said|I|have|muscle|weakness|and|have|to|strengthen|my|core|to|help|with|that|.|She|also|checked|my|reflexes|and|I|nearly|kicked|her|!|!|!|I|was|told|to|warn|any|doctors|that|do|this|test|so|they|don't|get|kicked|,|lol|.|She|was|so|nice|and|friendly|!|Anyway|,|three|days|later|I|awoke|and|all|pain|was|gone|!|It|had|left|just|the|same|as|it|arrived|!|I|saw|her|again|a|few|days|later|and|she|was|as|perplexed|as|I|was|!|She|had|me|do|some|stretches|and|we|both|agreed|it|would|be|silly|to|keep|seeing|her|when|I|had|no|pain|at|all|.|These|symptoms|just|keep|getting|weirder|.|I|see|an|MS|specialist|next|week|in|Pittsburg|,|and|his|reviews|sound|promising|.|He|listens|carefully|and|is|patient|and|writes|down|notes|and|gives|you|a|copy|.|I'm|not|getting|my|hopes|up|,|but|it|sure|would|be|nice|if|he|can|figure|this|all|out|.|At|the|very|least|I|hope|he|doesn't|just|drop|me|like|the|others|and|helps|me|find|an|answer|.|I|will|update|when|and|if|I|get|any|answers|.|Thanks|so|much|to|all|of|you|on|this|site|.|You|are|all|so|kind|and|helpful|to|all|of|us|who|are|scared|,|worried|and|confused|.|After|a|while|all|our|individual|stories|probably|sound|the|same|to|you|,|but|you|still|help|us|to|feel|better|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695734914072698331/Discussions---MS-Connection	Discussions - MS Connection	Jul 11, 2018 9:41 PM. When does abuse supersede symptom? Jul 11, 2018 11:17 PM. Holly, You need to learn the tools to deal with his anger. You can take responsibility for your family by getting yourself into therapy. You can get to be the leader in the family, for a better life, which is what you want to happen. Every relationship takes two persons, one of you must break the cycle of abuse. Jul 12, 2018 4:05 PM. Hello Holly,. Abuse of any kind is never ok. I think counseling sounds like a great option, but even if he is unwilling to go it is something you can do on your own. This link will allow you to search for counselors in your area. Our self-help groups are open to people with MS as well as family and friends. These groups are an ideal place to meet others. Those who love and care for persons with MS often find the groups helpful sources of support for information about local community resources and solutions to caregiving concerns. Use this link to locate a local self-help group. I also encourage you to check out this list of comprehensive carepartner support resources. If you need additional support, please contact us at 1.800.344.4867 (M-F 7am-5pm MST). MS Navigator Stephanie. Jul 16, 2018 12:36 AM. An abuser is not in a rational mind and can not be reached by the person being abused, therefore it is imperative for the person being abused to become educated to make an informed decision how to care for themselves and family, to be able to choose moving away from the abuser if necessary. Abusers are in need of therapy, agreed, but also can not be confronted without care. The more educated the victim becomes the safer all involved are. Safety is first priority for all. It is easier to educate the person being abused or to have others who are prepared to make an intervention. There are persons trained to approach this type of situation, it is not a good idea for the uninformed or uneducated to try to change these circumstances without the needed support of others. Both alcohol and drugs alter reality, we all know prescription drugs also change who we are and how we see things, care is needed in handling the situation. The more educated the more safe, although not a guarantee. 	0	0	Discussions|-|MS|Connection	Jul|11|,|2018|9:41|PM|.|When|does|abuse|supersede|symptom|?|Jul|11|,|2018|11:17|PM|.|Holly|,|You|need|to|learn|the|tools|to|deal|with|his|anger|.|You|can|take|responsibility|for|your|family|by|getting|yourself|into|therapy|.|You|can|get|to|be|the|leader|in|the|family|,|for|a|better|life|,|which|is|what|you|want|to|happen|.|Every|relationship|takes|two|persons|,|one|of|you|must|break|the|cycle|of|abuse|.|Jul|12|,|2018|4:05|PM|.|Hello|Holly|,|.|Abuse|of|any|kind|is|never|ok|.|I|think|counseling|sounds|like|a|great|option|,|but|even|if|he|is|unwilling|to|go|it|is|something|you|can|do|on|your|own|.|This|link|will|allow|you|to|search|for|counselors|in|your|area|.|Our|self-help|groups|are|open|to|people|with|MS|as|well|as|family|and|friends|.|These|groups|are|an|ideal|place|to|meet|others|.|Those|who|love|and|care|for|persons|with|MS|often|find|the|groups|helpful|sources|of|support|for|information|about|local|community|resources|and|solutions|to|caregiving|concerns|.|Use|this|link|to|locate|a|local|self-help|group|.|I|also|encourage|you|to|check|out|this|list|of|comprehensive|carepartner|support|resources|.|If|you|need|additional|support|,|please|contact|us|at|1.800.344.4867|(|M-F|7am|-|5pm|MST|)|.|MS|Navigator|Stephanie|.|Jul|16|,|2018|12:36|AM|.|An|abuser|is|not|in|a|rational|mind|and|can|not|be|reached|by|the|person|being|abused|,|therefore|it|is|imperative|for|the|person|being|abused|to|become|educated|to|make|an|informed|decision|how|to|care|for|themselves|and|family|,|to|be|able|to|choose|moving|away|from|the|abuser|if|necessary|.|Abusers|are|in|need|of|therapy|,|agreed|,|but|also|can|not|be|confronted|without|care|.|The|more|educated|the|victim|becomes|the|safer|all|involved|are|.|Safety|is|first|priority|for|all|.|It|is|easier|to|educate|the|person|being|abused|or|to|have|others|who|are|prepared|to|make|an|intervention|.|There|are|persons|trained|to|approach|this|type|of|situation|,|it|is|not|a|good|idea|for|the|uninformed|or|uneducated|to|try|to|change|these|circumstances|without|the|needed|support|of|others|.|Both|alcohol|and|drugs|alter|reality|,|we|all|know|prescription|drugs|also|change|who|we|are|and|how|we|see|things|,|care|is|needed|in|handling|the|situation|.|The|more|educated|the|more|safe|,|although|not|a|guarantee|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4706056550942364723/Signs-You-Are-Sabotaging-Your-MS-Treatment---Skipping-taking-your-medications	Signs You Are Sabotaging Your MS Treatment - Skipping taking your medication(s	MS is an autoimmune disorder, where the body’s immune system attacks myelin. Myelin, which forms a protective shield and insulates the lining of nerve fibers, is crucial to proper functioning of the nervous system. MS drugs are immuno-suppressive, which means that they work by suppressing, or altering, the activity of the body's immune system, thereby protecting myelin and preventing further destruction of the myelin sheath. Once you stop taking them, you allow your immune system to return to full strength and to attack your myelin again. You may not have any sign that this is happening until it’s too late, and you have a relapse. What happens when you skip your meds. Your medications do not cure MS, but they do reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and the development of new brain lesions. In addition, some medications may slow down the progression of MS, reducing future disability. “Clinical studies show that patients who had gaps in therapy lasting 90 days or more were nearly twice as likely to experience a severe relapse,” says Dr. Gabriel Pardo, director of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Multiple Sclerosis Center of Excellence. “It’s important for patients to find a routine that works for them and that they can adhere to,” he says. “Patients might feel well between relapses, but in fact the disease is progressing and they might not recover from their next relapse. The disease is still progressing, although the patient doesn’t know it. The brain has a great ability to repair itself and find new pathways. But if you create a roadblock the brain can get around it some of the time, but not all of the time.”. 	1	0	Signs|You|Are|Sabotaging|Your|MS|Treatment|-|Skipping|taking|your|medication|(|s	MS|is|an|autoimmune|disorder|,|where|the|body|’|s|immune|system|attacks|myelin|.|Myelin|,|which|forms|a|protective|shield|and|insulates|the|lining|of|nerve|fibers|,|is|crucial|to|proper|functioning|of|the|nervous|system|.|MS|drugs|are|immuno-suppressive|,|which|means|that|they|work|by|suppressing|,|or|altering|,|the|activity|of|the|body's|immune|system|,|thereby|protecting|myelin|and|preventing|further|destruction|of|the|myelin|sheath|.|Once|you|stop|taking|them|,|you|allow|your|immune|system|to|return|to|full|strength|and|to|attack|your|myelin|again|.|You|may|not|have|any|sign|that|this|is|happening|until|it|’|s|too|late|,|and|you|have|a|relapse|.|What|happens|when|you|skip|your|meds|.|Your|medications|do|not|cure|MS|,|but|they|do|reduce|the|frequency|and|severity|of|attacks|and|the|development|of|new|brain|lesions|.|In|addition|,|some|medications|may|slow|down|the|progression|of|MS|,|reducing|future|disability|.|“|Clinical|studies|show|that|patients|who|had|gaps|in|therapy|lasting|90|days|or|more|were|nearly|twice|as|likely|to|experience|a|severe|relapse|,|”|says|Dr|.|Gabriel|Pardo|,|director|of|the|Oklahoma|Medical|Research|Foundation|Multiple|Sclerosis|Center|of|Excellence|.|“|It|’|s|important|for|patients|to|find|a|routine|that|works|for|them|and|that|they|can|adhere|to|,|”|he|says|.|“|Patients|might|feel|well|between|relapses|,|but|in|fact|the|disease|is|progressing|and|they|might|not|recover|from|their|next|relapse|.|The|disease|is|still|progressing|,|although|the|patient|doesn|’|t|know|it|.|The|brain|has|a|great|ability|to|repair|itself|and|find|new|pathways|.|But|if|you|create|a|roadblock|the|brain|can|get|around|it|some|of|the|time|,|but|not|all|of|the|time|.|”|.

Pamela Newland, Rebecca A. Lorenz, Judith M. Smith, Emily Dean, John Newland,. Journal of Neuroscience Nursing. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships among multiplesclerosis (MS)–related symptoms, sleep hygiene behaviors, and sleep quality in adults with MS who self-report fatigue. Background: Fatigue is a frequent, prevalent symptom among adults with MS. Few studies have examined the relationship among fatigue and other symptoms with sleep quality and sleep behaviors. Design: This is a descriptive correlational study. Methods: A convenience sample of 39 adults with MS were recruited for the study. Instruments used included the revised MS Related Symptom Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Correlations examined the relationships among fatigue and other MS symptoms with sleep quality and sleep hygiene behaviors. Results: The frequency of several symptoms correlated with poor sleep quality, and fatigue frequency was higher in those who used electronic devices and practiced poor sleep hygiene behaviors. Nursing Implications: Nurses should incorporate interventions for symptoms that impact sleep quality. These findings suggest that sleep hygiene education should be a part of routine clinical care. Conclusion: Adults with MS experience the burden of many symptoms that impact sleep quality. Interventions that include education to improve symptoms, sleep hygiene behaviors, and sleep quality are needed. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system (CNS) disease leading to inflammation and demyelination of the brain and spinal cord. This debilitating neurological disorder affects an estimated 2.3 million adults worldwide and is the leading cause of loss of work and disability among young adults. 1,2 In addition to the neurological disease, MS is associated with several symptoms including disordered sleep that impacts overall well-being and quality of life (QOL). Signs and symptoms of MS depend on the location of the CNS affected; however, fatigue is themost common symptom of MS. Fatigue in MS4 can be caused either by the disease itself or as a result of other symptoms such as anxiety, depression, disordered sleep, or various medication regimens. Approximately 60% to 90% of people with MS complain of fatigue, and there is evidence that disordered sleep and depression are contributing factors. 5,6 It has been suggested that MS-related fatigue is both primary and secondary, with disordered sleep worsening fatigue by overstimulating the CNS. The etiology remains uncertain, but extreme triggering of the CNS may cause disruption in circadian rhythm leading to increase in fatigue severity. Fatigue leads to decreased QOL by impeding activities of daily living and reducing psychological well-being and ability to work. Fatigue in adults with MS can be affected by not only poor sleep quality but also anxiety and depression, which are also common. 7–9 In fact, anxiety can occur in approximately 30% of people with MS. 9 The stressors of the MS diagnosis can impact people because of the cumbersome disease sequelae, such as unpredictable relapses, complicated medication regimes, and multiple psychosocial issues.10 People with MS struggle daily with a multitude of symptoms, including pain, fatigue, cognitive issues, depression, and anxiety. Poor sleep hygiene is a set of behaviors that influence sleep quality (ie, watching television [TV], uncomfortable nighttime ambient temperature, and exciting presleep activities). These behaviors have been found to be more prevalent among poor sleepers. 12 There is some evidence of a relationship between fatigue and sleep qualityamong adults with MS. A few studies have suggested that sleep quality is connected to increased disability 13 and cognitive decline (sustained working memory) 14 and global cognitive performance, which can decrease QOL and theability to conduct work-related tasks. Fatigue and disordered sleep are a public health problem, and existing studies and education are lacking for those with MS. To our knowledge, no one has explored the relationship among fatigue, MS symptoms, and sleep hygiene behaviors. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among anxiety, difficulty concentrating, sleep hygiene behaviors, and sleep quality in adults with MS who self-report fatigue. The survey questions were developed to be completed by the participants in their desired setting (home, library) via computer, tablet, or other mobile devices with phone assistance available, if needed, from the primary investigator or research assistant. A computer programmer collaborated with the research team to develop the questionnaire within REDCap, a secured web environment. Next, interviews were conducted with 5 participants to ask for input on diary questions for the final version to be sent to a target of 30 participants with MS. Each subject received a web link through text message for detailed instructions and questions via REDCap. We recruited a convenience sample of community-dwelling adults from MS clinics in the midwestern United States during routine clinic appointments and from a local MS society's listserv. The inclusion criteria were a definitive diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS or secondary progressive MS, age of 18 to 70 years, willingness to write about symptoms and lifestyle habits in a web-based diary format, reliable computer and Internet access, and ability to read and speak English. We obtained the university's institutional review board approval. Written consent was obtained from all participants during a private face-to-face clinic visit once all questions were answered, and participants were assured of confidentiality and ability to withdraw at any time without consequence. After consent, participants who volunteered for the study completed a demographic form and were instructed how to use REDCap and provided instructions on completion of the web-based diary. Participants were asked to log into REDCap once a day for 7 consecutive days to answer narrative questions in the electronic diary regarding symptoms that positively or negatively impacted sleep and lifestyle habits. After 4 weeks, the subject was asked to repeat the survey for 7 more days. Data were collected for 7 consecutive days; however, because the primary aim was to examine feasibility of the data collection method, 4 days of electronic diary data were accepted as full participation in this study. Self-reported demographic information was obtained included age, race, sex, education, marital status, and disease-modifying therapy use (yes/no). Disease-modifying therapy use was validated through review of medical records. MS Related Symptom Scale (Revised). We obtained symptoms experienced using a revised version of the MS Related Symptom Scale, 16 with additional items generated from focus group data,5 and a single open-ended question to gather recent co-occurring symptoms(total, 37 items). Symptom frequency was reported on a 6-point scale from 0 (never) to 5 (always), with a total score ranging from 0 to 180 (higher score = higher frequency). The test-retest reliability was excellent at 0.89 .2,5. Expanded Disability Status Scale: Patient Version. The patient self-report version of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) provided an estimate of disability status. 17 The scale is composed of 17 items that mirror the physician-administered EDSS and has been found to be highly reliable with Cronbach's alpha of 0.92. Summing the scores provides a possible range of 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to MS). Sleep Quality (Single-Item Scale). All participants rated the previous night's sleep quality every morning on a visual analog scale from 1 to 10 (extremely poor to extremely good). Test-retest reliability coefficients of the Sleep Quality visual analog scale have been found to range from 0.91 to 0.90. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 19 to assess self-reported sleep quality. The PSQI includes 19 items creating 7 dimensions of sleep quality (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, the use of sleep-promoting medication, and daytime dysfunction). Each dimension was scored using a scale of 0 (not during the past month) to 3 (3 or more times per week) with a global sum of 5 or greater indicating poor sleep quality. Cronbach's α is .83 for its 7 components. 19 The instrument takes approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete. Sleep Behavior Self-Rating Scale. Participants rated during an average week how often they did certain behaviors around bedtime from never to very often. 20 Behaviors included watching TV, listening to the radio, reading, smoking, talking to someone, and eating or drinking. The instrument has a high test-retest reliability (r = 0.88) and internal consistency (Cronbach's α of .76). Descriptive statistics for continuous variables (mean, median, range, and standard deviation) were obtained for thesample. Frequency was tabulated for categorical variables. Symptom variables were computed using ordinal scale. The outcome variables were PSQI total scores, and the demographic variables were age and sex. Modeling was performed using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS. All analyses were 2-sided with a significance level of .05. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4. Characteristics of the Participants. The sample was composed of 39 participants with MS. Demographic and related clinical data are shown in Table 1. Most participants were female (85%) and white (81%). The subtype of MS was mainly relapsing-remitting MS (81%) with a mean (SD) time since diagnosis of 11.3 (7.5) years, and the mean (SD) EDSS (self-report version) was 3.8 (1.7), suggesting a lower level of disability (Table 1). Correlations did not reveal differences in age, education, length since diagnosis, MS relapse, disability status, or sleep variables from the PSQI. The frequencies of forgetfulness, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating were significantly correlated with sleep quality. Separate components of the PSQI were examined as predictors of sleep, in which 3 symptoms (forgetfulness, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating) were statistically significant predictors (P < .5). The remaining components were not associated with sleep (fatigue [P = .05], pain [P = .10], and heat intolerance [P = .25]). In contrast, fatigue, pain, and heat intolerance frequencies were not associated with sleep quality on the PSQI. Sleep behaviors including watching TV, talking on the phone, and listening to the radio significantly correlated with frequent reports of fatigue, forgetfulness, anxiety, and pain. In addition, watching TV and listening to the radio, but not talking on the phone, were significant for frequent reports of difficulty concentrating. Notably, talking on thephone was significantly associated with heat intolerance (Table 2). For the symptoms and demographic variables, there were significant differences for fatigue frequency and sex (P < .007). This article investigated self-report fatigue frequency and other symptoms with sleep quality and sleep hygiene behaviors in adults with MS. Our findings indicated that MS symptoms, including fatigue, are related to poor sleep hygiene behaviors, which corresponds with existing studies that indicate fatigue and poor sleep occur in more than 80% of the patients with MS. 3,21 This is a concern because fatigue and poor sleep often cluster with a cycle of depression, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating. 5,22 We found that psychological problems, including forgetfulness, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating, are also correlated with sleep quality. Our findings are significant for corroborating existing studies on the high prevalence of sleep problems among patients with MS. Furthermore, our findings signal the cascading of psychological problems and a need for mental health screening and intervention, especially when patients with MS present with sleep difficulties. Forgetfulness, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating were symptoms that correlated with sleep quality. Previous studies found that anxiety and poor sleep demonstrated a strong relationship to overall worry about health. 23,24 Reduced sleep quality is a severe problem for patients with MS and could negatively impact the patients' overall health. Furthermore, cognitive impairment and altered moods can manifest in those with difficulty sleeping. 13 Depression and anxiety are both considered mood disorders, often overlapping. Excessive worry, indicative of an anxiety spectrum disorder, is not only related to impaired health, but this relationship is bidirectional. 23 Moreover, fatigue, anxiety, poor sleep quality, and, ultimately, sleep hygiene behaviors may factor into this problem. It is unclear why these symptoms cluster together. Inconsistent with others, 2,21 pain was not significantly related with poor sleep quality. It may be that pain was underreported because of the severity of fatigue and other symptoms. It was not possible, however, to glean from this study because of lack of causation and the use of the revised version of the MS Related Symptom Scale, because it has only 1 item for pain frequency. Our findings suggest a need for further exploration and development of how symptoms are related, which would ultimately impact the lives of adults living with MS. Because fatiguefrequency and sleep quality are subjective symptoms, the 2 symptoms are better assessed as separate concepts. This study found that use of technology was related to sleep quality. These findings support the National Sleep Foundation's 25 recommendation to remove electronic devices, such as TV and phones, from the bedroom and restrict use during the hour before bedtime. 26 The use of technology before bedtime has been found to be associated with increased mood disturbances. 27 However, there has been little research on adults and, to our knowledge, none on adults with MS. There is some evidence suggesting that the combined use of mobile and computer use is associated with perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and sleep disturbances among college-aged adults. 28 Future studies should examine the underlying relationships between evening electronic device use, stress, sleep, and depression among adults. It is important to acknowledge the small sample size. In addition, because of the descriptive study design, it is not possible to establish causality, for example, between symptom pathology (eg, difficulty concentrating) and sleep quality. Thus, study results might not represent populations with greater odds of poor sleep quality due to increased disability. These results should be interrupted judiciously because of self-report of symptom frequency and sleep quality. Although both the MS-RS and the PSQI are well-validated tools for measuring symptoms and sleep quality, individual symptoms of anxiety and depression were not initially assessed for clinical depression or anxiety. Future studies may benefit from inclusion of well-validated tools recommended by the American Academy of Neurology (eg, Patient Health Questionnaire-9/Neuro QOL for depression and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety) 29 to establish a baseline and tease out subjective perceptions of the adults with MS. Nursing Implications and Future Directions. Our findings suggest that interventions aimed to improve sleep hygiene may also reduce anxiety, fatigue, and forgetfulness, which are common MS symptoms. Other interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, ought to be considered. At a minimum, these findings stress a need for comprehensive screening and assessment of multiple symptoms at each encounter such as a criterion standard fatigue assessment, with those of anxiety, sleep quality, or forgetfulness. 29,30 Nurses caring for patients with MS should educate them about successful coping skills and strategies with fatigue and sleep, especially for those who are prone to anxiety and worry. Future studies would be strengthened by using a combination of self-report and objective measures of sleep (eg, polysomnography, wrist actigraphy) in a larger sample of patients with MS. This study examined the relationship among fatigue, symptoms, sleep hygiene, and sleep quality in adults with MS. The findings suggest that several symptoms are still in need of assessment and screening to support improved sleep quality among adults with MS. In addition, education is needed on sleep hygiene measures to improve overall sleep. Future investigations of symptoms and sleep are needed, especially randomized efforts aimed at improving anxiety and depression and supporting sleep quality.

Trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) analyzer has shown much promise in this regard. Here, we further show the integration of ‘Parallel Accumulation followed by Serial Fragmentation’ (PASEF, Meier et al., J Proteome Res 2015). In this Webinar, we will explain the fundamentals of this technology and give examples of how the timsTOF Pro was applied for high sensitivity and high speed label-free proteome quantification. We will furthermore discuss factors for the success of these experiments, starting from sample preparation and liquid chromatography to method development and data analysis with MaxQuant. Ion mobility adds a dimension to LC-MS based shotgun proteomics which potentially can boost proteome coverage, quantification accuracy and dynamic range. Required for this is suitable software that extracts the information contained in the four-dimensional data space spanned by m/z, retention time, ion mobility and signal intensity. Here we describe the ion mobility enhanced MaxQuant software, which utilizes the added data dimension. It offers an end to end computational workflow for the identification and quantification in LC-IMS-MS/MS shotgun proteomics data. Here we apply it to Bruker timsTOF Pro data. Application to benchmark datasets show unprecedented identification depth in shingle shot HeLa runs and precise ratio quantification in datasets with known ground truth.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295944334024642/MS-Views-and-News:	MS Views and News:	Are blood tests becoming the future of managing multiple sclerosis? Earlier this year, the company IQuity released a blood test, IsolateMS, saying it could help diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients. And now a new blood test is showing potential in helping predict progression in MS. Currently, there is no way to predict progression, but the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans help doctors and patients track disease activity. This new blood test is based on a protein that is released following damage to cell axons. 	1	0	MS|Views|and|News|:	Are|blood|tests|becoming|the|future|of|managing|multiple|sclerosis|?|Earlier|this|year|,|the|company|IQuity|released|a|blood|test|,|IsolateMS|,|saying|it|could|help|diagnose|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|in|patients|.|And|now|a|new|blood|test|is|showing|potential|in|helping|predict|progression|in|MS|.|Currently|,|there|is|no|way|to|predict|progression|,|but|the|use|of|Magnetic|Resonance|Imaging|(|MRI|)|scans|help|doctors|and|patients|track|disease|activity|.|This|new|blood|test|is|based|on|a|protein|that|is|released|following|damage|to|cell|axons|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4625912976546492833/Differentiating-Between-Microbial-Species	Differentiating Between Microbial Species	By Catherine Shaffer, Ph.D. Differentiating bacterial strains within a single sample can be a daunting challenge. Microscopic studies of the sample can be used for simple identification and differentiation tasks. Microbiologists can identify the microbe by its morphological features and document all of the organisms in the sample. Staining, culturing, and simple biochemical tests are other traditional methods for distinguishing between microbial species. Serratia marcescens is a species of rod-shaped gram-negative bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae for Laboratory microbiology. Image Credit: Rattiya Thongdumhyu / Shutterstock. Traditional Methods. Microscopic features that can be used to identify bacteria include the overall shape of the microbe. Microbes can be shaped like rods, spheres, or spirals, or other shapes. Gram staining is a very common test used to determine the type of bacteria in a culture. It was named after the Danish bacteriologist Hans Christian Gram. Species including Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Clostridium turn purple with Gram stain. Other species like Escherichia, Helicobacter, and Salmonella are gram-negative, meaning they don’t change color with Gram stain. Some examples of biochemical testing include catalase testing, oxidase testing, and substrate utilization tests. Modern Methods. However, for some applications the numbers of bacteria are too great, or there are a great many unknown species and other methods are necessary to differentiate them. Some newer, more sophisticated methods for differentiating between microbes include PCR-based identification, microarray-based identification, and immunological identification. In PCR-based identification, real-time PCR is used to amplify certain genes which are then sequenced to confirm the identity of the microbe. In microarray-based identification, microbial DNA sequences are hybridized to species-specific oligonucleotide probes in a grid format. Related Stories. The identity of the microbe can then be determined by finding the “address” on the grid of a positive result. An immunological assay can detect species of microbes by linking antibodies for species-specific proteins to a detection method such as a dye. Methods like fatty acid profiling and chemo-profiling can also distinguish different microbes from each other. Microbial species often have unique combinations of fatty acids or metabolites that can distinguish them from each other. Metagenomics. In metagenomics studies, researchers have had success using genome sequencing to identify microbes in a sample. For example, in a study of Crohn’s disease, researchers are using sequencing to explore whether certain species of bacteria influence the function of the gastrointestinal microbiota in patients with Crohn’s disease compared with healthy individuals, and which microbial signatures correlate with occurrence and progression of the disease. In some cases, species-level differentiation might not be enough, and scientists may need to identify individual strains. In one case, U.S. officials found that Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli was the source of a food poisoning outbreak in Germany in 2005 and 2006. The researchers used PCR and nucleotide sequencing to identify the subtypes of specific variant genes between the strains to identify the strain responsible for the outbreak. Mass Spectroscopy. Instrumental methods can also be used to differentiate bacteria. For example, researchers used laser desorption postionization mass spectroscopy to differentiate microbial species and strains in a co-culture biofilm. They used cocultures of E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to mimic a naturally occurring producer-consumer ecological biofilm system. Other mass spectroscopy methods that have been used to differentiate species of bacteria are secondary ion mass spectra (SIMS) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS).

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531443310676090/Is-anyone-familiar-with-a-Burst-Neuorstimulator	Is anyone familiar with a Burst Neuorstimulator	"Originally Posted by Marco. I have both a medtronic pump and spinal cord stimulator (SCS). The pump is located lower left abdomen and SCS in my right lower back. I never had a problem with the two - they don't even know each other are there. The SCS needs to be reprogrammed from time to time to maximize the benefits. Ensure you are getting the MRI-compatible equipment and know there are differences between what MRIs are allowed. I'm not sure what the new SCS mri limitations are, but the device is a TON better than the old models. Fully charge in 1 hour (vs 8 hours/week), manageable via tablet ... yes, I wish I had that. The only problem is manufacturing delays are rampant because Puerto Rico got nailed with the hurricane. I did have a mandatory psych eval for the SCS, but not for the pump. I have no idea why the two were handled differently. Hi Marco,. Thanks for the info. Glad to hear that they're compatible from someone who actually had the two units at the same time. I'm sure Brad appreciates the information also. I've been told about the psyche evaluation too, and I thought the same thing... I've been walking around with an implanted. device for 7 years and it's the size of a hockey puck, so why are they worried about a little battery pack being implanted in my rump. The explanation I heard on a tape was the psyche eval is necessary because they want to make sure you'll be okay with knowing you have a device implanted. And once again I went ""huh."" Oh well, we do what we have to. I'm in a bit of a conundrum because in the last couple years I've developed neuromuscular scoliosis, and it's decided to steadily degenerate. Up until a few years ago my lower back x-ray just fine. Then I started leaning, and they did a scoliosis X-ray, and the curve was 40 degrees... but from what I read scoliosis degenerates about a degree per year. So the leaning continued and the next x-ray, less than a year later, showed the curve was a 55 degrees, and the next x-ray taken just a couple months down the road and it ws at 65. The neurosurgeon says I have to decide now if I'll have the surgery, but with the MS, and my age, there is no way I could rehab from the surgery. The neurosurgeons tell me it's a grueling surgery, well 2 surgeries. One 8 hour, then a couple days later a 10 hour. My reality after watching rehab videos and realizing what it takes to rehab correctly, my MS doesn't allow me to move in the manner that's needed for rehab. So we're saying no to the scoliosis surgery. (If you're interested, just google scoliosis surgery and click on images...it looks as bad as they say it is.). And that's where the neurostimulator comes in. Since the curve will continue to degenerate, the pain may get worse, and we're looking for something other than meds for the pain. I'll probably end up with a wheelchair, fitted for the scoliosis, and a head piece that will keep my head from flopping.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531517059710938/MS-Ireland-::	MS Ireland ::	The Hardest Thing. Thursday June 07 2018 11:30 AM. Next week, 11 th to the 17 th June, is Carer's Week in Ireland. We're delighted to have Guest Blogger Gemma Donnelly Cox writing about being a Carer and how she balances life in the ‘here and now' while also planning for the future. Caring, for me, is about enabling and empowering my husband to live the life of his choosing to his highest potential. Simple, eh? I'm not so sure. Over and over again, I am torn between goals that, at times, conflict. And I'll bet this happens to every carer; maybe not the same goals but tension nevertheless. Currently, the ones that preoccupy me have to do with timing and with attitude. When I say timing, I mean whether to focus on the present or the future. A whole lot of enabling and empowering is about making the most of every day; doing today's work today. Right now, I'm typing this blog and Alexis, my husband, who is quadriplegic with progressive MS, is using voice control software to work on his computer. Our son has just left the house to go bouldering at the climbing gym up the road. We are all enjoying the here and now this afternoon. Much of the time, however, I feel as though my focus is planning for the future, leaving little room for the present. So much thought goes into what I know lies ahead and also to planning for the unknowns. What if Alexis' voice starts to weaken further and he can't use voice control software? Should he be using eye control now, just in case? But what if his eyesight starts to fail? Worries about the future can rob you of ‘the now' as you flail around trying to prepare for what might emerge. But if you only stay in ‘the now', you could very well end up not being ready when one of these MS issues suddenly rears its head. Right up there with timing is attitude. It seems to me that so much of what is joyous in life is about knowing when things are good, celebrating them and being grateful for them. Like right now blogging about how it feels to be a carer. A lot of the time, however, gratitude for the good things can be in tension with putting mental energy into staying vigilant and being ready to advocate. For example, Alexis was recently invited to a dinner with people who know a lot about MS. I was looking forward to going with him and slacked up on my usual advocacy of making his requirements clear to the hosts. I figured that people in the know would get it right. Wrong . The hosts invited a quadriplegic guest seated in a large wheelchair to a venue where the tables were way too low for his chair. The path to the (too small) space at a table- in the middle of a room, full of seated diners- was impossibly narrow. It does not have to be like that folks! It's hard to be grateful for a nice night out when your husband can't reach the table and your advocating would have made it different. When I feel I'm getting the balance right managing the tension between timing and attitude, I am far happier and more confident in my Carer role. But before I sign off, I'd like to add one more tension, the one that can arise between caring and self-care. During Carer's Week, we're reminded that Superwomen and Supermen stay sharper when they take care of themselves. I was reminded of this back in the autumn when I was away for the weekend by myself (a super duper self-care step) and I came across a young couple in their 20s. The carer in the partnership was a real Wonder Woman. But she was wrecked tired, more tired than I remember being at her age and stage. I had time on my hands and tried to help out. She knew I was up to the job but she simply couldn't let herself stop. Carers, none of us last forever but if you want to be in for the long haul and really make a difference for your loved one, you've got to take care of yourself too. For many carers, I guess that's the hardest thing. Gemma and Alexis Donnelly live in Dublin with their son Finn and Labrador Retriever, Elmo. In 2016, Alexis joined the Scientific Steering Committee of the Progressive MS Alliance. His carers have supported him to fulfil his role in the Alliance. For more on the Progressive MS Alliance and the exceptional work that it does in pursuit of its aim to understand and overcome some of the biggest barriers to treatment development for progressive MS, see.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Wednesday May 30 2018 05:45 PM. ‘Making Ireland the Best Place to do Multiple Sclerosis Research’ Report Sets Out Next Steps for the Improved Access to Treatments and Novel Therapeutics. To mark World MS Day on 30 May 2018, MS Ireland, supported by Novartis, will launch a new report which is intended to help create an MS research landscape that will put Ireland at the forefront of MS research, innovation and therapeutic application.[i] The report aims to support researchers and provide people with MS and the public with a better understanding of the research process and ongoing research. Some of the recommendations include the establishment of an MS Research Community, improved data and information sharing, greater involvement of people living with MS, potential funding models, and improved dissemination of research findings. The community will help overcome obstacles to research such as gathering samples, establishing a biobank and a patient register. The report defines a number of key asks as follows:. “Given the prevalence of MS here, Ireland should be leading the way in MS research. The report launched today gives us a blueprint of what needs to be done,” says Ava Battles, CEO of MS Ireland. “As a first step, we want to establish an MS research community collective to bolster Ireland’s current research strengths to obtain more funding and improve research visibility. While the top priorities in MS research are currently being addressed, this could be done better if the MS community addressed them as a collective.”. Dr Claire McCoy, RCSI, said, “Research offers people living with MS real hope for improvement both in their treatment but also in their quality of life. I am delighted to support MS Ireland in speaking at their public meeting that will help bring people up to date with progress that is being made. The report also lays out a clear pathway that will help to overcome some of the issues that have been faced and I would urge people working in the treatment of MS to get involved as the recommendations are rolled out.”. Commenting on the launch of the report, Loretto Callaghan, General Manager & Country President, Novartis Ireland said, “We are committed to working with MS Ireland to help raise awareness on the importance of research. Research plays a major role in progress so understanding the barriers that exist is the first step in devising a plan that will help to overcome these issues in the future. We believe that Ireland can become a leader in MS research and look forward to collaborating further with MS Ireland to deliver the recommendations of the ‘Making Ireland the Best Place to do Multiple Sclerosis Research’ report.”. This report was compiled following a meeting with a mix of stakeholders interested in MS research in Ireland, including patients, doctors, scientists and nurses and was facilitated by Novartis Ireland in November 2017. 	1	0	MS|Ireland|::|Helping|Everyone|Affected|by|Multiple|Sclerosis	MS|Ireland|::|.|Helping|Everyone|Affected|by|Multiple|Sclerosis|.|Wednesday|May|30|2018|05:45|PM|.|‘|Making|Ireland|the|Best|Place|to|do|Multiple|Sclerosis|Research|’|Report|Sets|Out|Next|Steps|for|the|Improved|Access|to|Treatments|and|Novel|Therapeutics|.|To|mark|World|MS|Day|on|30|May|2018|,|MS|Ireland|,|supported|by|Novartis|,|will|launch|a|new|report|which|is|intended|to|help|create|an|MS|research|landscape|that|will|put|Ireland|at|the|forefront|of|MS|research|,|innovation|and|therapeutic|application|.|[|i|]|The|report|aims|to|support|researchers|and|provide|people|with|MS|and|the|public|with|a|better|understanding|of|the|research|process|and|ongoing|research|.|Some|of|the|recommendations|include|the|establishment|of|an|MS|Research|Community|,|improved|data|and|information|sharing|,|greater|involvement|of|people|living|with|MS|,|potential|funding|models|,|and|improved|dissemination|of|research|findings|.|The|community|will|help|overcome|obstacles|to|research|such|as|gathering|samples|,|establishing|a|biobank|and|a|patient|register|.|The|report|defines|a|number|of|key|asks|as|follows|:|.|“|Given|the|prevalence|of|MS|here|,|Ireland|should|be|leading|the|way|in|MS|research|.|The|report|launched|today|gives|us|a|blueprint|of|what|needs|to|be|done|,|”|says|Ava|Battles|,|CEO|of|MS|Ireland|.|“|As|a|first|step|,|we|want|to|establish|an|MS|research|community|collective|to|bolster|Ireland|’|s|current|research|strengths|to|obtain|more|funding|and|improve|research|visibility|.|While|the|top|priorities|in|MS|research|are|currently|being|addressed|,|this|could|be|done|better|if|the|MS|community|addressed|them|as|a|collective|.|”|.|Dr|Claire|McCoy|,|RCSI|,|said|,|“|Research|offers|people|living|with|MS|real|hope|for|improvement|both|in|their|treatment|but|also|in|their|quality|of|life|.|I|am|delighted|to|support|MS|Ireland|in|speaking|at|their|public|meeting|that|will|help|bring|people|up|to|date|with|progress|that|is|being|made|.|The|report|also|lays|out|a|clear|pathway|that|will|help|to|overcome|some|of|the|issues|that|have|been|faced|and|I|would|urge|people|working|in|the|treatment|of|MS|to|get|involved|as|the|recommendations|are|rolled|out|.|”|.|Commenting|on|the|launch|of|the|report|,|Loretto|Callaghan|,|General|Manager|&|Country|President|,|Novartis|Ireland|said|,|“|We|are|committed|to|working|with|MS|Ireland|to|help|raise|awareness|on|the|importance|of|research|.|Research|plays|a|major|role|in|progress|so|understanding|the|barriers|that|exist|is|the|first|step|in|devising|a|plan|that|will|help|to|overcome|these|issues|in|the|future|.|We|believe|that|Ireland|can|become|a|leader|in|MS|research|and|look|forward|to|collaborating|further|with|MS|Ireland|to|deliver|the|recommendations|of|the|‘|Making|Ireland|the|Best|Place|to|do|Multiple|Sclerosis|Research|’|report|.|”|.|This|report|was|compiled|following|a|meeting|with|a|mix|of|stakeholders|interested|in|MS|research|in|Ireland|,|including|patients|,|doctors|,|scientists|and|nurses|and|was|facilitated|by|Novartis|Ireland|in|November|2017|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295893373854306/MS-Views-and-News:	MS Views and News:	MAY 22, 2018. Spring has sprung! As I look around, Mother Earth is in bloom. Trees are sprouting new leaves, plants are growing, and the grass is green once again. I love spring and all that it represents — hopes for new birth and rebirth. For those who are unaware, May is Mental Health Awareness Month. I write this week to encourage those who are battling and surviving mental illness and any related disorders. It serves to urge everyone to actively recognize the warning signs of someone in need of assistance. This column is a call to action to offer support, empathy, a safe environment, and to eradicate stigma. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) reports that one in five adults in the U.S. experience a mental illness, and one in 25 adults live with a serious mental illness. Mental health continues to be an issue that is under-discussed, undertreated, and often ignored. However, there are warning signs. My experiences of having MS and heart disease have introduced me to depression and anxiety. From my window seat, my eyes opened to the struggle that many people face on a daily basis. I have vowed to learn about mental health disorders, speak openly about them, share my personal experience, get acquainted with available resources , and offer encouraging words. On my journey as a heart health and MS advocate, I have met people who struggle, survive, and thrive with mental illness. I have realized that there is one commonality that we possess, which is to know that we matter. We need to know that someone cares and that they hear our voices. There is a desire to feel that we have value and the longing to feel that life, in all of its tragedy and turmoil, is really worth living. :::::::. 	1	1	MS|Views|and|News|:	MAY|22|,|2018|.|Spring|has|sprung|!|As|I|look|around|,|Mother|Earth|is|in|bloom|.|Trees|are|sprouting|new|leaves|,|plants|are|growing|,|and|the|grass|is|green|once|again|.|I|love|spring|and|all|that|it|represents|—|hopes|for|new|birth|and|rebirth|.|For|those|who|are|unaware|,|May|is|Mental|Health|Awareness|Month|.|I|write|this|week|to|encourage|those|who|are|battling|and|surviving|mental|illness|and|any|related|disorders|.|It|serves|to|urge|everyone|to|actively|recognize|the|warning|signs|of|someone|in|need|of|assistance|.|This|column|is|a|call|to|action|to|offer|support|,|empathy|,|a|safe|environment|,|and|to|eradicate|stigma|.|The|National|Alliance|on|Mental|Illness|(|NAMI|)|reports|that|one|in|five|adults|in|the|U|.|S|.|experience|a|mental|illness|,|and|one|in|25|adults|live|with|a|serious|mental|illness|.|Mental|health|continues|to|be|an|issue|that|is|under-discussed|,|undertreated|,|and|often|ignored|.|However|,|there|are|warning|signs|.|My|experiences|of|having|MS|and|heart|disease|have|introduced|me|to|depression|and|anxiety|.|From|my|window|seat|,|my|eyes|opened|to|the|struggle|that|many|people|face|on|a|daily|basis|.|I|have|vowed|to|learn|about|mental|health|disorders|,|speak|openly|about|them|,|share|my|personal|experience|,|get|acquainted|with|available|resources|,|and|offer|encouraging|words|.|On|my|journey|as|a|heart|health|and|MS|advocate|,|I|have|met|people|who|struggle|,|survive|,|and|thrive|with|mental|illness|.|I|have|realized|that|there|is|one|commonality|that|we|possess|,|which|is|to|know|that|we|matter|.|We|need|to|know|that|someone|cares|and|that|they|hear|our|voices|.|There|is|a|desire|to|feel|that|we|have|value|and|the|longing|to|feel|that|life|,|in|all|of|its|tragedy|and|turmoil|,|is|really|worth|living|.|::|:|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692885896608275493/Bringing-Us-Closer---MS-Connection	Bringing Us Closer - MS Connection	Living with MS can sometimes feel like you’re stranded on an island by yourself. People who don’t have MS might not fully understand what you’re going through, and others living with MS may have symptoms and experiences entirely different from yours. To make the MS world smaller, this year’s World MS Day (May 30) theme is “bringing us closer.” It’s about building connections and sharing stories to unify us in our collective stand against MS. Connect with the researchers, students and nurses who are at the forefront of finding a cure to bring us closer to a world free of MS. Meet two of our researchers and learn how their work is #BringingUsCloser to a cure. Haley Titus, MD, PhD. Haley (far right) and her family. Why did Haley get involved with MS research? It all started with her mother. “My personal and professional life goal is to cure MS, as my mother has secondary progressive MS. She is the most optimistic person I know. She has taught me how to be a kind, strong and empowered woman. She taught me the value and importance of resiliency. My goal is to create a brighter future and better quality of life through my work. I feel obligated to serve because I have the privilege of being able to.”. Haley’s research focuses on the immune system and expanding ways people with MS can empower themselves. “What I work on is selectively targeting just the small part of the immune system that goes awry in MS. We are also working on the combination of selective immunoregulatory therapy and myelin repair in addition to promoting general wellness such as diet and exercise.”. Melissa Brown, PhD. Melissa was already working in the research field when MS affected her family. “When my brother was diagnosed, I was already an immunologist doing research. He was a sophomore in college when he had the first indication that something was wrong. It was a very scary time for him and our family. We knew there was no cure and that it was hard to predict how severe his disabilities would become. Luckily, I had access to published scientific information and of course was eager to learn what was known about the MS and what treatments were available to patients.”. She has hope for the future of MS research and hopes others do as well. “A diagnosis of MS is perhaps less devastating today perhaps than when my brother was first evaluated. Earlier treatment and much better drugs with fewer side effects are available for many patients that dramatically slow progression. I am very hopeful that this disease can be conquered. There are many dedicated people who are working on this problem. Importantly, there is a revolution in the technology that allows us to collect and share large amounts of genetic and cellular data from patients. With a little more time and research support, I think real changes in treatment are just over the horizon.”.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295966667877373/MS-Views-and-News:	MS Views and News:	Julie Roberts , a country music singer and multiple sclerosis (MS) patient advocate, will perform at the upcoming Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) ’s annual meeting, the association announced. Additionally, Julie will be presenting at the MS Views and News educational program on May 29th at the Nashville Marriott Airport, as showing here . to attend this event, RSVP here . Roberts, diagnosed with MS while making her second recording in 2005, will also attend #CMSC sessions to learn more about potential and current treatments, and ongoing research in the disease. The conference runs from May 30 to June 2 in Nashville. She is set to perform at the meeting’s opening John F. Kurtzke Memorial Lecture and Luncheon on Wednesday, and again at its awards reception on Friday, June 1. Her first single, “ Break Down Here ,” was a Billboard Top 20 Hot Country Song and she has sold millions of albums. Roberts says she met her diagnosis with years of denial, refusing to pursue any treatment. “I thought if I ignored my MS it would go away,” she said in a press release . Then another disaster struck. Record-shattering rainfall flooded Nashville in early May 2010, inundating the Roberts family home and killing 26 people across Tennessee and neighboring Kentucky. Roberts and her family were rescued by boat, after frightening hours that led to an awakening. “The flood rescue made me realize that I needed to manage my MS, adopt a healthy and positive lifestyle, and show others that the disease does not define who you are or stop you from pursing your dreams,” she said. She now encourages patients to find a neurologist and healthcare team they trust and feel comfortable with to ensure the care they need. “Julie Roberts is living proof of the mission of the CMSC and its Annual Meeting – to present MS healthcare teams with the latest information and tools to provide optimum care to those living with MS,” said June Halper, chief executive officer of CMSC. “We are excited to have Julie at our conference to entertain and share her MS journey with our attendees.”. In Roberts’ latest album, “I Think You Know,” produced by Shooter Jennings, she sings about love, loss, roots, and redemption. She also has a biography, “ Beauty in the Breakdown, Choosing to Overcome ,” set for release in September. :::::::. 	1	1	MS|Views|and|News|:	Julie|Roberts|,|a|country|music|singer|and|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|patient|advocate|,|will|perform|at|the|upcoming|Consortium|of|Multiple|Sclerosis|Centers|(|CMSC|)|’|s|annual|meeting|,|the|association|announced|.|Additionally|,|Julie|will|be|presenting|at|the|MS|Views|and|News|educational|program|on|May|29th|at|the|Nashville|Marriott|Airport|,|as|showing|here|.|to|attend|this|event|,|RSVP|here|.|Roberts|,|diagnosed|with|MS|while|making|her|second|recording|in|2005|,|will|also|attend|#CMSC|sessions|to|learn|more|about|potential|and|current|treatments|,|and|ongoing|research|in|the|disease|.|The|conference|runs|from|May|30|to|June|2|in|Nashville|.|She|is|set|to|perform|at|the|meeting|’|s|opening|John|F|.|Kurtzke|Memorial|Lecture|and|Luncheon|on|Wednesday|,|and|again|at|its|awards|reception|on|Friday|,|June|1|.|Her|first|single|,|“|Break|Down|Here|,|”|was|a|Billboard|Top|20|Hot|Country|Song|and|she|has|sold|millions|of|albums|.|Roberts|says|she|met|her|diagnosis|with|years|of|denial|,|refusing|to|pursue|any|treatment|.|“|I|thought|if|I|ignored|my|MS|it|would|go|away|,|”|she|said|in|a|press|release|.|Then|another|disaster|struck|.|Record-shattering|rainfall|flooded|Nashville|in|early|May|2010|,|inundating|the|Roberts|family|home|and|killing|26|people|across|Tennessee|and|neighboring|Kentucky|.|Roberts|and|her|family|were|rescued|by|boat|,|after|frightening|hours|that|led|to|an|awakening|.|“|The|flood|rescue|made|me|realize|that|I|needed|to|manage|my|MS|,|adopt|a|healthy|and|positive|lifestyle|,|and|show|others|that|the|disease|does|not|define|who|you|are|or|stop|you|from|pursing|your|dreams|,|”|she|said|.|She|now|encourages|patients|to|find|a|neurologist|and|healthcare|team|they|trust|and|feel|comfortable|with|to|ensure|the|care|they|need|.|“|Julie|Roberts|is|living|proof|of|the|mission|of|the|CMSC|and|its|Annual|Meeting|–|to|present|MS|healthcare|teams|with|the|latest|information|and|tools|to|provide|optimum|care|to|those|living|with|MS|,|”|said|June|Halper|,|chief|executive|officer|of|CMSC|.|“|We|are|excited|to|have|Julie|at|our|conference|to|entertain|and|share|her|MS|journey|with|our|attendees|.|”|.|In|Roberts|’|latest|album|,|“|I|Think|You|Know|,|”|produced|by|Shooter|Jennings|,|she|sings|about|love|,|loss|,|roots|,|and|redemption|.|She|also|has|a|biography|,|“|Beauty|in|the|Breakdown|,|Choosing|to|Overcome|,|”|set|for|release|in|September|.|::|:|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692886075710503066/MS-Ireland--::-Helping-Everyone-Affected-by-Multiple-Sclerosis	MS Ireland  :: Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis	"MS Ireland  ::. Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Thursday May 10 2018 11:00 AM. This week, in a letter to her nearest and dearest, Willeke Van Eeckhoutte puts down in words how she really feels. “What do you want me to say?”. Dearly Beloved,. What do you want me to say? What is it you don’t understand? When someone like you says, ""Well, what do you want me to say?"" during moments when I feel less than cheerful, it sounds like a rejection. Not just of me, but of your understanding of what I, and we, have been going through for the past 13 years. After all this time, all the wisdom we have gained, we could be the writers of the largest MS encyclopaedia! Instead, being asked that question sounds like a betrayal. It’s like you’re using the illness I never asked for as a slur against me. The truth is, I could write you a hundred different letters and a thousand expert explanations about my symptoms and my thoughts on all those shiny plaques on my MRI images. Nonetheless, I often think, ""How can you possibly relate to my life if you don’t have MS? But, with all its intricate, demeaning and unpredictable symptoms, how could I ever expect you to?"" The answer is, you honestly cannot know what it is to be me, and this is not my rejection of you, far from it. But, I do need to plea for your insight, patience and empathy. Just as I am struggling to find the words in this letter, MS is an ever-changing plotline that forces me to reinvent my life’s storyline as we speak. When I snap at you, I don’t mean to. More to the point, you were probably not the problem. Like when slamming a door in anger, the doorframe, the wall or the house aren’t ever reasons for the action. Sometimes I am absolutely worn out, totally exhausted because of my illness. This exhaustion feels even more pronounced when people express how they don’t understand me. I’m tired of the illness that has me acting in ways I normally wouldn’t. I carry an imperfect brain because of illness with a fickle revolving-door manifestation. It causes me to feel claustrophobic within myself. I know that keeping up with an ever-changing illness is as challenging for you as it is for me. I also know that there are times when you’d rather be somewhere else instead of being near me. What I want you to get is I don’t wallow in self-pity nor do I jump up and down in elation because I was diagnosed with this obnoxious illness. MS has impacted so many aspects of my life, it is part of what makes my life what it is today. Makes me how I am today. I sure am! Hopeful that you would understand me? What I ask for is simple but it isn’t easy. You are part of my walk through life and am glad to have you with me. When you feel exasperated by what I say or do, please step into my shoes with me for one minute and we can work out what’s really going on. Lots of love,.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295894958557527/Dealing-with-Dizziness-and-Vertigo-When-You-Live-with-MS	Dealing with Dizziness and Vertigo When You Live with MS	Many people with MS experience episodes of dizziness, which can make you feel lightheaded or off-balance. Some also have episodes of vertigo. Vertigo is the false sensation of whirling or spinning of yourself or the world around you. According to one report , about 20 percent of people with MS experience vertigo. Dizziness and vertigo contribute to balance problems, which are common in people with MS. Ongoing dizziness and vertigo can interfere with daily tasks, increase the risk of falls, and can even become disabling. What vertigo feels like. Vertigo is an intense sensation of spinning, even if you’re not moving. It’s similar to what you feel on a twirling amusement park ride. The first time you experience vertigo can be very unsettling, even frightening. Vertigo may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. It can continue for hours, or even days. Sometimes, dizziness and vertigo are accompanied by vision problems, tinnitus or hearing loss, or trouble standing or walking. Causes of dizziness and vertigo in MS. The lesions that result from MS make it difficult for nerves within the central nervous system to send messages to the rest of the body. This causes MS symptoms, which vary according to the location of the lesions. A lesion or lesions in the brain stem or cerebellum, the area of the brain that controls balance, may cause vertigo.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692531432870435780/SSDI-during-STDLTD-process	SSDI during STD/LTD process	Great discussion! I have a couple of clarifications to add. (1) Medicare: There is a 29 month waiting period for Medicare from the date you became disabled. As such, if you leave work in January 2018, it doesn't matter if you apply in February 2018 or January 2019, as Medicare will look to the date you became disabled (likely the date you left work) to start the 29 month waiting period. There are some small exceptions to this rule, but it applies in 95% of cases. (2) SSDI Representation: If you are approved for long term disability, your insurer will almost universally pay for your SSDI representation. They will not tell you, however, that you can pick your representative, and need not use their 'captured' representative. What is the risk of using their captured representative? I'll list several concerns in a moment, but this morally questionable tactic is emblematic of the conflict of interest experienced by the captured representatives: perhaps the largest of these groups has all claimants sign a release that allows the representative check their bank account multiple times per day looking for a large deposit from the SSA. If such a deposit occurs, the release allows the representative to pull these funds and give them to the insurance company without speaking with you. In fact, this is a major portion of this group's advertising to the insurers (I've been in the room when this pitch is made). If they didn't do this, you could likely negotiate a payment plan with the insurer to allow you to catch up on your bills after approval. Furthermore, (1) you may not meet your attorney until the day of the hearing, (2) your representative at the hearing may not be an attorney, (3) many of these firms have information-sharing agreements with the insurers that are not in your best interest, and (4) these firms agree to charge the insurer a below-market rate which requires barebones services to achieve profitability. I'm likely biased against these providers, but I've also seen enough clients harmed by their levels of service and conflict of interest to recommend high levels of caution when using their services. Take my comments (and theirs!) with a grain of salt, and do your homework before hiring any counsel in these important matters! Attorney Jamie R. Hall's practice is focused on assisting individuals with claims and appeals for Social Security Disability and Long Term Disability benefits. He has assisted claimants nationwide, approximately half of whom are MS patients, from his Pennsylvania and Ohio locations, as well as via JRHLegal.com. **No attorney/client relationship is created by this communication, and information provided herein is not a substitute for formal advisement.**. 	0	0	SSDI|during|STD|/|LTD|process	Great|discussion|!|I|have|a|couple|of|clarifications|to|add|.|(|1|)|Medicare|:|There|is|a|29|month|waiting|period|for|Medicare|from|the|date|you|became|disabled|.|As|such|,|if|you|leave|work|in|January|2018|,|it|doesn't|matter|if|you|apply|in|February|2018|or|January|2019|,|as|Medicare|will|look|to|the|date|you|became|disabled|(|likely|the|date|you|left|work|)|to|start|the|29|month|waiting|period|.|There|are|some|small|exceptions|to|this|rule|,|but|it|applies|in|95|%|of|cases|.|(|2|)|SSDI|Representation|:|If|you|are|approved|for|long|term|disability|,|your|insurer|will|almost|universally|pay|for|your|SSDI|representation|.|They|will|not|tell|you|,|however|,|that|you|can|pick|your|representative|,|and|need|not|use|their|'|captured|'|representative|.|What|is|the|risk|of|using|their|captured|representative|?|I'll|list|several|concerns|in|a|moment|,|but|this|morally|questionable|tactic|is|emblematic|of|the|conflict|of|interest|experienced|by|the|captured|representatives|:|perhaps|the|largest|of|these|groups|has|all|claimants|sign|a|release|that|allows|the|representative|check|their|bank|account|multiple|times|per|day|looking|for|a|large|deposit|from|the|SSA|.|If|such|a|deposit|occurs|,|the|release|allows|the|representative|to|pull|these|funds|and|give|them|to|the|insurance|company|without|speaking|with|you|.|In|fact|,|this|is|a|major|portion|of|this|group's|advertising|to|the|insurers|(|I've|been|in|the|room|when|this|pitch|is|made|)|.|If|they|didn't|do|this|,|you|could|likely|negotiate|a|payment|plan|with|the|insurer|to|allow|you|to|catch|up|on|your|bills|after|approval|.|Furthermore|,|(|1|)|you|may|not|meet|your|attorney|until|the|day|of|the|hearing|,|(|2|)|your|representative|at|the|hearing|may|not|be|an|attorney|,|(|3|)|many|of|these|firms|have|information-sharing|agreements|with|the|insurers|that|are|not|in|your|best|interest|,|and|(|4|)|these|firms|agree|to|charge|the|insurer|a|below-market|rate|which|requires|barebones|services|to|achieve|profitability|.|I'm|likely|biased|against|these|providers|,|but|I've|also|seen|enough|clients|harmed|by|their|levels|of|service|and|conflict|of|interest|to|recommend|high|levels|of|caution|when|using|their|services|.|Take|my|comments|(|and|theirs|!|)|with|a|grain|of|salt|,|and|do|your|homework|before|hiring|any|counsel|in|these|important|matters|!|Attorney|Jamie|R|.|Hall's|practice|is|focused|on|assisting|individuals|with|claims|and|appeals|for|Social|Security|Disability|and|Long|Term|Disability|benefits|.|He|has|assisted|claimants|nationwide|,|approximately|half|of|whom|are|MS|patients|,|from|his|Pennsylvania|and|Ohio|locations|,|as|well|as|via|JRHLegal.com|.|*|*|No|attorney|/|client|relationship|is|created|by|this|communication|,|and|information|provided|herein|is|not|a|substitute|for|formal|advisement|.|*|*|.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Tuesday May 08 2018 10:42 AM. Balloon launch and music to mark World MS Day. Cllr Francis Timmons in Partnership with the Dublin West ''Brendan Kenna'' MS Ireland Branch will host a balloon launch & music at 7.30pm outside in the Waterside Carpark to mark World MS Day on Wednesday, 30th May . Followed by light refreshments. All welcome! Former Branch chair and local councillor , Cllr Timmons says '' Thankfully Research is bringing us closer to ending MS. To reach this we need to work together as a worldwide MS community to find ways to improve life with MS now and end MS forever. The #bringinguscloser campaign is about connecting people affected by MS with those involved in MS research, including scientists, students, nurses, fundraisers, volunteers, and more. It's a chance to come together to celebrate what we've achieved in MS research so far, and share our hopes and dreams for the future. One of the former Chairpersons of the Branch the Late Brendan Kenna said make the most of life and least of MS and it's a fitting quote as we celebrate World MS Day 2018 ''. Cllr Timmons says '' I also want to use this World MS Day event to Honour former Chairperson of the Dublin West ''Brendan Kenna'' MS Ireland Branch Michael Fox who sadly passed away 18th February 2018 He is sadly missed by his family and many friends and colleagues in the community and voluntary sector including the Southside Partnership, ACTS and the Multiple Sclerosis Society. He was actively involved in the branch in many roles and contributed a huge amount to the MS Community, I was very honoured to have served on the Dublin West ''Brendan Kenna'' MS Ireland Branch with Michael ''. Current Branch Chair Gary Connolly says '' The last year for the branch has been really hard loosing Michael Fox, the branch has suffered the loss of a great man, Michael was a huge part of the branch and his tireless work and commitment will never be forgotten, we are working hard to keep the branch going, the branch really needs support from people in the areas of West Dublin in any way, shape or form, either helping with fundraising or coming on the committee to help keep up the good work and ensure that the branch continues to make a difference to people with MS in the West Dublin area for the next 26 years''. Branch member Angela Connolly who lives with MS says '' I am living with MS for 10 years and it does not define me it is part of my life, not my whole life and I have to adjust my life to live with the illness as part of me, the branch is very important to many people with MS providing practical supports I remain very positive about the future as medication is all the time improving''.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295933612245380/Therapeutic-Inertia-in-the-New-Landscape-of-Multiple-Sclerosis-Care.	Therapeutic Inertia in the New Landscape of Multiple Sclerosis Care.	Saposnik G, et al. Front Neurol. The landscape of multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment is constantly changing. Significant heterogeneity exists in the efficacy and risks associated with these therapies. Therefore, clinicians have the challenge to tailor treatment based on several factors (disease activity level, risk of progression, individual patient preferences and characteristics, personal expertise, etc.), to identify the optimal balance between safety and efficacy. However, most clinicians have limited education in decision-making and formal training in risk management. Together, these factors may lead to therapeutic inertia (TI); defined as the absence of treatment initiation or intensification when therapeutic goals are unmet. TI may lead to suboptimal treatments choices, worse clinical outcomes, and more disability. This article provides a succinct overview on factors influencing TI in MS care. Watch an Aaron Boster, MD interview on Therapeutic Inertia. :::::::. 	1	0	Therapeutic|Inertia|in|the|New|Landscape|of|Multiple|Sclerosis|Care|.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Friday May 04 2018 08:00 AM. This week Mary Deveraux shares with us her experience of Primary Progressive MS. Akin to the big stories we’re all familiar with, PPMS brings unexpected twists to life no-one ever expects. Living with Primary Progressive MS is like starting a new book, with a difference. Each and every page you turn brings an unexpected ‘twist in the tale’. As the days add up, I realise my experience is like an epic story akin to the Iliad. It consumes my life and the lives of all that surrounds me as we grapple with the unexpected (far too regularly). The motto changed in my home from “will we” to “if your up to it” . Once there was a name put on it, Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) it was as though the floodgates opened. Every sort of symptom came in my door, wrapped around and in me and never left my body. The PPMS brings new ones with it too. From incredible pain to mind blowing fatigue that makes me want to become one with the sofa! PPMS is exhausting and the mental strain that makes it even more so. The forgetfullness, the difficulty in making decisions, the doubting myself and a pervading send of fear of doing something wrong that would effect others and making mistakes. In my line of work I couldn't afford mistakes. I would never have forgiven myself. After a difficult six years of traumatic change, I stopped running away from my illness. I am learning to accept that the work that I had dedicated my life to had to go. Then there was the personal guilt and shame of letting THAT go. Because of my symptoms, I failed an off-the-road test and my driving licence was taken away. Accepting all these changes is hard. Readers would know from my previous piece that I was always ‘The Fixer’. Now I can’t fix myself. Yet, as time is going on I am learning that I can help myself. I have had to get out and make new friends and do things at 50 I never thought I would be doing. I accept all the help that’s offered with the grace and kindness with which it is offered. I now need a cane to walk and know I might need a mobility scooter on holidays to make sure I make the most of my holiday time. That’s okay. These changes (the cane, the mobility scooter, asking for help, being open about my vulnerability) don’t come easy nor over night. But this process of asking for help and accepting it absolutely is making my life easier and this transition more tolerable. Living with Primary Progressive MS is never going to be easy for me; it doesn’t give me a break or a holiday. It has broken my heart. But as I accept the changes, that I have more limitations, I still pick up my book. Each day I get to turn the pages and through all the heartache, I’m determined to find the hero and the great things in my story. Today, may we all remember WE ARE the heroes in our story. 	1	1	MS|Ireland|::|Helping|Everyone|Affected|by|Multiple|Sclerosis	MS|Ireland|::|.|Helping|Everyone|Affected|by|Multiple|Sclerosis|.|Friday|May|04|2018|08:00|AM|.|This|week|Mary|Deveraux|shares|with|us|her|experience|of|Primary|Progressive|MS|.|Akin|to|the|big|stories|we|’|re|all|familiar|with|,|PPMS|brings|unexpected|twists|to|life|no-one|ever|expects|.|Living|with|Primary|Progressive|MS|is|like|starting|a|new|book|,|with|a|difference|.|Each|and|every|page|you|turn|brings|an|unexpected|‘|twist|in|the|tale|’|.|As|the|days|add|up|,|I|realise|my|experience|is|like|an|epic|story|akin|to|the|Iliad|.|It|consumes|my|life|and|the|lives|of|all|that|surrounds|me|as|we|grapple|with|the|unexpected|(|far|too|regularly|)|.|The|motto|changed|in|my|home|from|“|will|we|”|to|“|if|your|up|to|it|”|.|Once|there|was|a|name|put|on|it|,|Primary|Progressive|Multiple|Sclerosis|(|PPMS|)|it|was|as|though|the|floodgates|opened|.|Every|sort|of|symptom|came|in|my|door|,|wrapped|around|and|in|me|and|never|left|my|body|.|The|PPMS|brings|new|ones|with|it|too|.|From|incredible|pain|to|mind|blowing|fatigue|that|makes|me|want|to|become|one|with|the|sofa|!|PPMS|is|exhausting|and|the|mental|strain|that|makes|it|even|more|so|.|The|forgetfullness|,|the|difficulty|in|making|decisions|,|the|doubting|myself|and|a|pervading|send|of|fear|of|doing|something|wrong|that|would|effect|others|and|making|mistakes|.|In|my|line|of|work|I|couldn't|afford|mistakes|.|I|would|never|have|forgiven|myself|.|After|a|difficult|six|years|of|traumatic|change|,|I|stopped|running|away|from|my|illness|.|I|am|learning|to|accept|that|the|work|that|I|had|dedicated|my|life|to|had|to|go|.|Then|there|was|the|personal|guilt|and|shame|of|letting|THAT|go|.|Because|of|my|symptoms|,|I|failed|an|off-the-road|test|and|my|driving|licence|was|taken|away|.|Accepting|all|these|changes|is|hard|.|Readers|would|know|from|my|previous|piece|that|I|was|always|‘|The|Fixer|’|.|Now|I|can|’|t|fix|myself|.|Yet|,|as|time|is|going|on|I|am|learning|that|I|can|help|myself|.|I|have|had|to|get|out|and|make|new|friends|and|do|things|at|50|I|never|thought|I|would|be|doing|.|I|accept|all|the|help|that|’|s|offered|with|the|grace|and|kindness|with|which|it|is|offered|.|I|now|need|a|cane|to|walk|and|know|I|might|need|a|mobility|scooter|on|holidays|to|make|sure|I|make|the|most|of|my|holiday|time|.|That|’|s|okay|.|These|changes|(|the|cane|,|the|mobility|scooter|,|asking|for|help|,|being|open|about|my|vulnerability|)|don|’|t|come|easy|nor|over|night|.|But|this|process|of|asking|for|help|and|accepting|it|absolutely|is|making|my|life|easier|and|this|transition|more|tolerable|.|Living|with|Primary|Progressive|MS|is|never|going|to|be|easy|for|me|;|it|doesn|’|t|give|me|a|break|or|a|holiday|.|It|has|broken|my|heart|.|But|as|I|accept|the|changes|,|that|I|have|more|limitations|,|I|still|pick|up|my|book|.|Each|day|I|get|to|turn|the|pages|and|through|all|the|heartache|,|I|’|m|determined|to|find|the|hero|and|the|great|things|in|my|story|.|Today|,|may|we|all|remember|WE|ARE|the|heroes|in|our|story|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295892102038429/MS-Views-and-News:	MS Views and News:	30th April 2018. The new guideline aims to help clinicians choose among as many as two dozen potential therapies which, it is hoped, will delay disease progression, and help more patients avoid fearsome consequences like severe disability and reduce life expectancy. But doctors also face the challenge of limited follow-up for many of these drugs, one of which was recently voluntarily removed from the market due to side effects. A new practice guideline published by the American Academy of Neurology on April 23 attempted to sort out recommendations among an explosion of drugs for multiple sclerosis which are considered to be disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) which have been approved in recent years. The guideline, which discussed clinical questions such as choice of therapies, as well as strategies including switching or stopping DMTs, was published during the Academy’s annual meeting in Los Angeles. The guideline discussed 17 FDA-approved medications, and also made a weak recommendation regarding off-label use of six other drugs. (Patients may also have to take other drugs to treat their symptoms, which DMTs are not intended to address). The cornucopia of new medications, at least seven of which have only been approved since 2010, has its origin in immune strategies. “If you trace it back to the very first FDA-approved medicine, interferon in 1993, the scientists knew MS had something to do with the immune system,” said Alexander Rae-Grant, MD, professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, and lead author on the article. Another older drug, glatiramer acetate, was approved in 1996. “It is like a molecular mimic; it confuses the immune system into attacking the medicine, because it looks like myelin,” the substance that surrounds nerve cells, said Rae-Grant. “We know everything there is to know about that medicine. “Since then, we’ve become much more targeted in our approach, and we’ve adapted some medications used in cancer populations, as well as rheumatology,” he added. Head-to-Head Clinical Trials Urgently Needed. But much less is known about some of the newer medications, leading the members of the guideline committee to make recommendations about the need for clinical trials in areas like comparative effectiveness and pregnancy-related issues. And prior to just last year, with the approval of ocrelizumab, there was no DMT for the primary progressive form of MS. (A classification system for several varieties of MS was revised in 2016). The uncertainty some clinicians may experience is illustrated by the voluntary withdrawal from the market of one drug, daclizumab, which was initially referred to in the guideline, according to Rae-Grant (daclizumab was first approved in 1997 for transplant patients). Neurologists are hopeful that the new therapies will be life-changing for some patients. Perhaps the most feared consequences of MS are severe disability and a somewhat reduced life expectancy. “It used to be that about half of the patients would not be able to walk independently after about 25 years. But we don’t have a lot of long-term data on the MS population,” noted Rae-Grant. “If we go back to earliest therapies, some cohorts have been followed for 20 years. But some of the new DMTs have only been available for two-to-five years, and disease progression is typically measured by relapses which occur over two to three years,” explained Ruth Ann Marrie, MD, PhD, professor at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, and co-author on the article. “So it’s difficult to say what a new therapy is going to do for somebody 20 years from now.”. But neurologists are hopeful that patients will experience some long-term benefits, including a delay of progression. In determining how to do that, the experts debated questions like whether to prescribe the strongest therapies first, or to switch to them if less potent drugs stop working.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295942215940341/MS-Views-and-News:	MS Views and News:	April 23, 2018. · Four years of continuous treatment with OCREVUS showed a sustained reduction in underlying disease activity in relapsing MS (RMS) in analysis from the open-label extension period. · Additional analyses show OCREVUS delayed cognitive decline and improved cognitive function in RMS, as measured by Symbol Digit Modalities Test. · OCREVUS reduced the presence of nerve damage and inflammation biomarkers in people with RMS shown in interim data from a Phase III study. · New safety data are consistent with OCREVUS’ favorable benefit-risk profile for both RMS and primary progressive MS. · Over 40,000 patients treated with OCREVUS globally. SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – April 23, 2018 – Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), announced today that new OCREVUS (ocrelizumab) data were presented at the 70 th American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting from April 21-27 in Los Angeles, California. The data showcase the efficacy of OCREVUS in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) through several measures of underlying disease activity and disability progression, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cognitive function, and spinal fluid biomarkers of inflammation and neurodegeneration. New safety data remain consistent with OCREVUS’ favorable benefit-risk profile in both relapsing and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). “The OCREVUS data shared at AAN show the impact of this targeted B cell therapy on slowing disability progression in MS, and further support the approach of early treatment. In the extension studies, patients who received OCREVUS continuously experienced less disease progression than those who began treatment at a later time point,” said Stephen Hauser, M.D., chair of the Scientific Steering Committee of the OPERA studies, director of the Weill Institute for Neurosciences and chair of the Department of Neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. “It is encouraging that with up to four years of data, we continue to see a robust effect and a consistent safety profile.”. After four years of continuous treatment, the benefits of OCREVUS in reducing underlying disease activity in RMS were sustained, as shown in a platform presentation measuring brain MRI activity through the randomized and open-label extension (OLE) periods of the Phase III studies. Patients who stayed on OCREVUS maintained low numbers of T1 gadolinium-enhancing (T1Gd+) lesions (0.017 pre-OLE to 0.17 T1Gd+ lesions per scan at year four [year two of the OLE phase]) and new/enlarging T2 (N/ET2) lesions [0.052 pre-OLE to 0.080 N/ET2 lesions per scan] through year two of the OLE phase. Patients who switched from Rebif ® (interferon beta-1a) to OCREVUS at the start of the OLE period had a near-complete silencing of T1Gd+ lesions per scan at one and two years (0.476 pre-OLE to 0.007 and 0.004 T1Gd+ lesions per scan), as well as an 85 and 97 percent decrease in N/ET2 lesions per scan at years one and two, respectively (2.159 pre-OLE to 0.333 and 0.063 N/ET2 lesions per scan). :::::::. 	1	0	MS|Views|and|News|:	April|23|,|2018|.|·|Four|years|of|continuous|treatment|with|OCREVUS|showed|a|sustained|reduction|in|underlying|disease|activity|in|relapsing|MS|(|RMS|)|in|analysis|from|the|open-label|extension|period|.|·|Additional|analyses|show|OCREVUS|delayed|cognitive|decline|and|improved|cognitive|function|in|RMS|,|as|measured|by|Symbol|Digit|Modalities|Test|.|·|OCREVUS|reduced|the|presence|of|nerve|damage|and|inflammation|biomarkers|in|people|with|RMS|shown|in|interim|data|from|a|Phase|III|study|.|·|New|safety|data|are|consistent|with|OCREVUS|’|favorable|benefit-risk|profile|for|both|RMS|and|primary|progressive|MS|.|·|Over|40,000|patients|treated|with|OCREVUS|globally|.|SOUTH|SAN|FRANCISCO|,|Calif|.|–|April|23|,|2018|–|Genentech|,|a|member|of|the|Roche|Group|(|SIX|:|RO|,|ROG|;|OTCQX|:|RHHBY|)|,|announced|today|that|new|OCREVUS|(|ocrelizumab|)|data|were|presented|at|the|70|th|American|Academy|of|Neurology|(|AAN|)|Annual|Meeting|from|April|21-27|in|Los|Angeles|,|California|.|The|data|showcase|the|efficacy|of|OCREVUS|in|relapsing|multiple|sclerosis|(|RMS|)|through|several|measures|of|underlying|disease|activity|and|disability|progression|,|including|magnetic|resonance|imaging|(|MRI|)|,|cognitive|function|,|and|spinal|fluid|biomarkers|of|inflammation|and|neurodegeneration|.|New|safety|data|remain|consistent|with|OCREVUS|’|favorable|benefit-risk|profile|in|both|relapsing|and|primary|progressive|multiple|sclerosis|(|PPMS|)|.|“|The|OCREVUS|data|shared|at|AAN|show|the|impact|of|this|targeted|B|cell|therapy|on|slowing|disability|progression|in|MS|,|and|further|support|the|approach|of|early|treatment|.|In|the|extension|studies|,|patients|who|received|OCREVUS|continuously|experienced|less|disease|progression|than|those|who|began|treatment|at|a|later|time|point|,|”|said|Stephen|Hauser|,|M|.|D|.|,|chair|of|the|Scientific|Steering|Committee|of|the|OPERA|studies|,|director|of|the|Weill|Institute|for|Neurosciences|and|chair|of|the|Department|of|Neurology|at|the|University|of|California|,|San|Francisco|.|“|It|is|encouraging|that|with|up|to|four|years|of|data|,|we|continue|to|see|a|robust|effect|and|a|consistent|safety|profile|.|”|.|After|four|years|of|continuous|treatment|,|the|benefits|of|OCREVUS|in|reducing|underlying|disease|activity|in|RMS|were|sustained|,|as|shown|in|a|platform|presentation|measuring|brain|MRI|activity|through|the|randomized|and|open-label|extension|(|OLE|)|periods|of|the|Phase|III|studies|.|Patients|who|stayed|on|OCREVUS|maintained|low|numbers|of|T1|gadolinium-enhancing|(|T1Gd|+|)|lesions|(|0.017|pre-OLE|to|0.17|T1Gd|+|lesions|per|scan|at|year|four|[|year|two|of|the|OLE|phase|]|)|and|new|/|enlarging|T2|(|N|/|ET2|)|lesions|[|0.052|pre-OLE|to|0.080|N|/|ET2|lesions|per|scan|]|through|year|two|of|the|OLE|phase|.|Patients|who|switched|from|Rebif|®|(|interferon|beta|-|1a|)|to|OCREVUS|at|the|start|of|the|OLE|period|had|a|near-complete|silencing|of|T1Gd|+|lesions|per|scan|at|one|and|two|years|(|0.476|pre-OLE|to|0.007|and|0.004|T1Gd|+|lesions|per|scan|)|,|as|well|as|an|85|and|97|percent|decrease|in|N|/|ET2|lesions|per|scan|at|years|one|and|two|,|respectively|(|2.159|pre-OLE|to|0.333|and|0.063|N|/|ET2|lesions|per|scan|)|.|::|:|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692885904397054972/It's-Time---MS-Connection	It's Time - MS Connection	Have you ever had a moment where you realize, “it’s time?” Time to make a change and let go of the past? When I was 10 years old, I had my first job delivering newspapers. I woke up before 5 a.m., traversed through our dark neighborhood in hot, cold, rain and even snow, bringing that morning’s The Washington Post to customers doorsteps. It was my first taste of “working.” It certainly wasn’t easy, but I loved it. In fact, I still have a plaque from the Post in my home office that commends my “outstanding performance during the blizzards of 1987.”. Yes, we even had to deliver those papers during a blizzard! Working was my comfort zone; it’s where I thrived. From paperboy to various jobs at a dry cleaner, local Chinese restaurant or Blockbuster video, I loved it all--the atmosphere, working with others, even collaborating with some of the owners. I genuinely enjoyed it. Once I got to college, a then young, growing financial company called Capital One hired me in June 1998, and my professional career officially began. And what a ride it was. It included meeting my future wife, working at two prominent Fortune 200 companies, a move to Texas, graduate school and even starting a family. I started as a tax accountant and ended as a director of product management. After being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, I wanted to continue to work, even as I was receiving monthly infusion for my MS. My former manager told me that “Mike Wentink at 75 percent is better than most,” and I wanted to prove him right. I had visions of pioneering the 21st century remote executive, living with a chronic disease, but still performing at a high level. Unfortunately, after 20 years of working, I couldn’t sustain the energy required for an entire day, and relapses were becoming common. So, just over six years ago, I medically retired from the professional workforce. Although I don’t look back with sadness, there is a certain emptiness. Work was a large part of who I was. My identity. My wife and I met at my first job, so working always holds a special place in my heart. And I’ll always cherish how she’d look at me, her eyes beaming with pride after some of my career achievements. My car, purchased new in 2009 to celebrate my new position as product manager, sits mostly idle at home, nine years later, with barely 23k miles on it. And my closet is filled with a work wardrobe that’s gathering dust. I guess I should say, was filled with work clothes. Earlier this year, I realized it was time . I’ve made peace with having MS. I’m no longer chasing the ghosts of who I was; rather, I want to embrace who I’ve become and can still be. The clothes had to go. Taking that step wasn’t easy, but you know what? It felt good. Each new day is another opportunity to re-define who you are and to become a new or better person. I’m still “working,” just not how I used to be. Managing a chronic disease like MS is a full-time job. However, in the absence of my professional career, I’ve discovered and developed many other aspects of my life. I write and podcast about living with MS. It’s not easy, but I love doing it. I provide my wife support and career advice, and the children call me “Teacher Daddy” because I’m always there to help them with homework or study for a test. And whenever I find enough energy, I love to bring smiles to my family’s tummies with my baking. I’ll always have my career memories, from paperboy to product manager… but now I look forward to forging new paths and experiences. And the best part is, no slacks or stuffy buttons down shirts are required. 	1	1	It's|Time|-|MS|Connection	Have|you|ever|had|a|moment|where|you|realize|,|“|it|’|s|time|?|”|Time|to|make|a|change|and|let|go|of|the|past|?|When|I|was|10|years|old|,|I|had|my|first|job|delivering|newspapers|.|I|woke|up|before|5|a|.|m|.|,|traversed|through|our|dark|neighborhood|in|hot|,|cold|,|rain|and|even|snow|,|bringing|that|morning|’|s|The|Washington|Post|to|customers|doorsteps|.|It|was|my|first|taste|of|“|working|.|”|It|certainly|wasn|’|t|easy|,|but|I|loved|it|.|In|fact|,|I|still|have|a|plaque|from|the|Post|in|my|home|office|that|commends|my|“|outstanding|performance|during|the|blizzards|of|1987|.|”|.|Yes|,|we|even|had|to|deliver|those|papers|during|a|blizzard|!|Working|was|my|comfort|zone|;|it|’|s|where|I|thrived|.|From|paperboy|to|various|jobs|at|a|dry|cleaner|,|local|Chinese|restaurant|or|Blockbuster|video|,|I|loved|it|all--the|atmosphere|,|working|with|others|,|even|collaborating|with|some|of|the|owners|.|I|genuinely|enjoyed|it|.|Once|I|got|to|college|,|a|then|young|,|growing|financial|company|called|Capital|One|hired|me|in|June|1998|,|and|my|professional|career|officially|began|.|And|what|a|ride|it|was|.|It|included|meeting|my|future|wife|,|working|at|two|prominent|Fortune|200|companies|,|a|move|to|Texas|,|graduate|school|and|even|starting|a|family|.|I|started|as|a|tax|accountant|and|ended|as|a|director|of|product|management|.|After|being|diagnosed|with|multiple|sclerosis|,|I|wanted|to|continue|to|work|,|even|as|I|was|receiving|monthly|infusion|for|my|MS|.|My|former|manager|told|me|that|“|Mike|Wentink|at|75|percent|is|better|than|most|,|”|and|I|wanted|to|prove|him|right|.|I|had|visions|of|pioneering|the|21st|century|remote|executive|,|living|with|a|chronic|disease|,|but|still|performing|at|a|high|level|.|Unfortunately|,|after|20|years|of|working|,|I|couldn|’|t|sustain|the|energy|required|for|an|entire|day|,|and|relapses|were|becoming|common|.|So|,|just|over|six|years|ago|,|I|medically|retired|from|the|professional|workforce|.|Although|I|don|’|t|look|back|with|sadness|,|there|is|a|certain|emptiness|.|Work|was|a|large|part|of|who|I|was|.|My|identity|.|My|wife|and|I|met|at|my|first|job|,|so|working|always|holds|a|special|place|in|my|heart|.|And|I|’|ll|always|cherish|how|she|’|d|look|at|me|,|her|eyes|beaming|with|pride|after|some|of|my|career|achievements|.|My|car|,|purchased|new|in|2009|to|celebrate|my|new|position|as|product|manager|,|sits|mostly|idle|at|home|,|nine|years|later|,|with|barely|23k|miles|on|it|.|And|my|closet|is|filled|with|a|work|wardrobe|that|’|s|gathering|dust|.|I|guess|I|should|say|,|was|filled|with|work|clothes|.|Earlier|this|year|,|I|realized|it|was|time|.|I|’|ve|made|peace|with|having|MS|.|I|’|m|no|longer|chasing|the|ghosts|of|who|I|was|;|rather|,|I|want|to|embrace|who|I|’|ve|become|and|can|still|be|.|The|clothes|had|to|go|.|Taking|that|step|wasn|’|t|easy|,|but|you|know|what|?|It|felt|good|.|Each|new|day|is|another|opportunity|to|re-define|who|you|are|and|to|become|a|new|or|better|person|.|I|’|m|still|“|working|,|”|just|not|how|I|used|to|be|.|Managing|a|chronic|disease|like|MS|is|a|full-time|job|.|However|,|in|the|absence|of|my|professional|career|,|I|’|ve|discovered|and|developed|many|other|aspects|of|my|life|.|I|write|and|podcast|about|living|with|MS|.|It|’|s|not|easy|,|but|I|love|doing|it|.|I|provide|my|wife|support|and|career|advice|,|and|the|children|call|me|“|Teacher|Daddy|”|because|I|’|m|always|there|to|help|them|with|homework|or|study|for|a|test|.|And|whenever|I|find|enough|energy|,|I|love|to|bring|smiles|to|my|family|’|s|tummies|with|my|baking|.|I|’|ll|always|have|my|career|memories|,|from|paperboy|to|product|manager|…|but|now|I|look|forward|to|forging|new|paths|and|experiences|.|And|the|best|part|is|,|no|slacks|or|stuffy|buttons|down|shirts|are|required|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295989152473401/MS-Views-and-News:	MS Views and News:	Reprint - 04.19.18. By Laurie Loscocco. June 12, 2017. For patients with complex and chronic medical conditions, knowledge is power. Without checks and balances, it also can be risky. Physicians who treat patients with multiple sclerosis say the internet in particular provides a wealth of information, both good and bad. For patients seeking to learn more, Google can lead to websites and social-media platforms serving a steady diet of information about diagnosis, treatment and management of their disease. While physicians welcome patient interest and knowledge, they also caution that not all websites are created equal and not all information found on the internet is valid. “You don't need to be a highly trained neuroimmunologist with multiple years of education to write something for the internet,” notes Aaron Boster, MD, director of the MS center at OhioHealth. In general, physicians say they don't discourage patients from seeking information online, as long as they bring what they find to their healthcare professionals. When patients come to Boster with questions about things they've read on websites or online forums, “I see a patient who is engaged, who wants to be educated and involved in their care.”. So does Timothy Shephard, MD, vice president of neurosciences at Mount Carmel Health System. “The better informed a patient is coming into an appointment, the better that appointment is going to be. I have yet to meet a physician who doesn't welcome a patient who has done research and is well-informed,” he says. Tech-Savvy Patients. Because the average age of onset for MS is 30, many patients “are people who have grown up with an iPad in their hands,” Boster says. “These are millennials who are extremely comfortable with and savvy about the internet and social media.”. When seeking information about MS, physicians say this: Consider the source. Especially in the first couple of years following a diagnosis, Boster advises patients to steer clear of the internet when it comes to MS advice. “It takes about two years for a patient to be comfortable in their own skin with their disease. They need to develop filters to evaluate what they read online. Until they do, their care team is that filter.”. Early in the course of their disease, “reading too much is guaranteed to make you frustrated,” says Boster, who also serves as OhioHealth's system medical chief of neuroimmunology. Realizing, however, that patients won't be able to resist the temptation, he urges them to “read with profound caution.”. Boster and others say it's crucial for patients to bring everything and anything they read online to their physicians so they can separate fact from fiction. Physicians say it's their job to temper expectations and provide reliable information. Boster has even initiated campaigns across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to dispense “digestible amounts of information” about the newest developments in MS. Relying on the internet to diagnose and plan for multiple sclerosis is tricky because the disease manifests itself differently in each patient. MS lesions can occur anywhere in the central nervous system, and symptoms can mimic other conditions, says Michael Racke, MD, a neurologist at OSU. For example, if the disease affects the optic nerve, loss of vision may result. If it happens in an older person, one might attribute that to normal aging. In a younger person, “We might be more inclined to think MS,” he says. Because the disease represents a unique interface between the nervous system and the immune system, it's nearly impossible to predict how it will evolve from person to person, Boster says. Twins can have the same disease yet experience it differently, he explains. Due to this variability, “You can read something from a reputable source, and it still might not apply to your particular disease.”. Online Communities. By its nature, MS can feel like a “lonely” disease, Boster says. Some of its symptoms, such as pathologic fatigue, aren't obvious or observable. Because of its relapsing/remitting characteristics, patients might seem well one month and debilitated the next. That can cause problems in the workplace, where employers might mistakenly believe employees are shirking responsibility or malingering. The Multiple Sclerosis Society of America has created visual models of the relapsing/remitting nature of multiple sclerosis to help employers understand what's happening. When dealing with workplace challenges and other issues, patient forums are another online source of support and information. “Especially for the newly diagnosed, they can be helpful,” Shephard says. “Forums can be a good source of really creative ideas from people who've gone before you.” They can offer guidance, for instance, on the best places to shop to avoid fatigue, how to deal with summer heat, how to adapt a house for wheelchair access. Because a significant number of MS patients have difficulty with cognitive processing at some point during the course of the disease, the forums can provide answers on how they and their caregivers deal with the situation, Shephard says. Boster says forums serve their best purpose by providing a safe place for patients to share with one other. “There is a sense of acceptance, understanding and community that is invaluable.”. They also can be confusing because of the volume of opinions expressed. Boster cautions that online platforms can be “the bathroom wall of comments,” with little accountability or ownership. Too Good to Be True? Those caring for people with multiple sclerosis feel perhaps most uneasy about the internet when it's used to promote unproven,potentially dangerous treatments. In the past few years, for-profit stem-cell clinics have proliferated in the United States and abroad. Their websites do not go unnoticed by patients, some of whom are willing to try anything. “In the last 12 months, I've had so many patients ask me, ‘What about these stem cells?'” Boster says. Although stem-cell therapy is not approved by the US Food & Drug Administration to treat MS, the clinics claim it provides relief from the disease. Some sites feature video testimonials from patients who say their lives have been transformed. “It looks pretty impressive,” Racke says. “But are patients putting themselves at risk and undergoing procedures that aren't medically necessary?”. He understands their frustration. “Patients who are desperate may be looking for something that is too good to be true. There may be a little too much enthusiasm for untested, unproven treatments.”. Such direct-to-consumer appeals by people promising miracles are “quackery,” Boster says. “It's predatory behavior that is abominable. It's selling false hope, and it's taking advantage of people who are very vulnerable.”. Shephard says patients in the secondary progressive stages of MS are most at risk for seeking cures at any cost. “The best you can do is educate them on the potential risks of alternative therapies and explain why FDA approval is so important. But at the end of the day, it's the patient's right to do what they feel they need to do,” he says. “Healthcare is not about forcing people to do something. It's about advising patients to make the best decision possible.”. Laurie Loscocco is a freelance writer. MS Views and News is MAKING an IMPACT on those affected by Multiple Sclerosis.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702046762208871178/My-mom-has-MS,-and-now-I-do-too---Blog---MS-Society-of-Canada	My mom has MS, and now I do too - Blog - MS Society of Canada	Guest post by Sarah Flohr, MS Walk ambassador. My mom was diagnosed with MS in 2000 and I’ve watched it gradually progress over time. She needed a cane, then a walker, a wheelchair, and now she’s living in a long-term care facility. I had seen through the eyes of a caregiver for my mom for years. Then, four years ago, my vision went blurry and I started having trouble seeing anything at all. I would soon have to hear the words, just like my mom once did, “you have multiple sclerosis.”. My mom’s symptoms started around 1995. She wasn’t sure what was causing them and neither were the doctors. She had symptoms with her back and was experiencing pain throughout her body. It took a really long time for them to figure out what was going on. Once it progressed to the point where my mom needed to be in a care facility, I decided that I wanted to be there for her as much as I could. My dad and I visit her every single day. My dad goes in the morning to spend time with her and help with her meals, and I’ll go in the evening and help her do simple things like drinking or even changing the channel on the TV. That’s been a big part of our lives, helping her with those day-to-day tasks. There’s a struggle there between taking care of her and taking care of myself. I work everyday and my job is quite busy, so finding a balance is challenging, especially now that I’m also living with MS. I really didn’t see my diagnosis coming – I wasn’t prepared. One day, everything I saw just became blurry. I thought I might need new glasses, so I made an appointment with my eye doctor. They recommended that I see family doctor as soon as possible. My family doctor was concerned with my symptoms and urgently sent me to a neurologist. I had an MRI done and was diagnosed with MS shortly after. Even though my MS is different than my mom’s, I get worried that mine might develop into a more aggressive form like hers. Seeing it have such an impact on my mom everyday is extremely concerning, but I try to remind myself that everybody’s MS journey is different. My mom is in a care facility, although that’s not necessarily where my journey of the disease will take me. It’s essential for me to remind myself of that everyday. The sad reality is that you don’t really know when or how your disease will progress. Some days, I stress about my future and how my physical or mental capabilities will be affected. Most days, I feel optimistic about my future because I’m confident we will increase access to therapies and resources that will help improve our lives, and eventually find a cure. As a young woman, who is impacted directly by MS and also a caregiver to someone living with MS, I think it’s important to use my voice and provide my unique perspective. I can see and feel firsthand how MS affects everyone, not just those who are diagnosed. I also think it is extremely important to raise awareness and to meet individuals that are impacted by MS. One of the biggest ways I do that is through MS Walk and that’s why I help organize it. Not only do I love how the event raises an incredible amount of much needed awareness, but it’s really inspiring to see the entire community of people who show up. Even though we are there for so many different reasons or people, we are there for a common goal. We all want to fund MS research and fight for a cure. I’m confident we can get there.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295905569232763/The-Benefits-of-Yoga-for-People-with-MS	The Benefits of Yoga for People with MS	Experts say yoga can reduce the chronic pain associated with multiple sclerosis, as well as improve balance and relieve depression. The ancient practice of yoga has long been touted as a wellness modality. Yoga loosely translates to “ union ,” or the yoke connecting one to God, and can be traced back 5,000 years to the Indus-Sarasvati region in Northern India. For centuries yoga was practiced as medicine and as a spiritual path. Modern medicine is catching up. On more than one occasion yoga has been clinically proven to provide healthy results. An increasing amount of clinical studies focus on yoga as it specifically benefits those with multiple sclerosis (MS).

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692295982875838471/Long-Haul-Paul:-Riding-a-Million-Miles-for-the-Cure	Long Haul Paul: Riding a Million Miles for the Cure	Words by Paul Pelland |. Photos by Matt Kiedaisch. As I slid down a lonely Arkansas highway just as the sun’s warmth was cresting the horizon, I couldn’t help but think this may not have been one of my better ideas. If I managed to live through the next few seconds, not only would the entire world know I was an idiot, I would have one hell of a long walk home. I slid on my chest in slow motion, my motorcycle just a few feet ahead of me shedding pounds by the foot, marring the pavement while creating a fantastic light show. Bright, colorful sparks, the likes of which no Japanese bike could ever create. The bike was veering toward the right shoulder like an obedient pigeon, and I dragged my right boot like a rudder to follow it to its familiar home, the breakdown lane. Every believing biker knows tractor-trailers would never be allowed to drive past the pearly gates, so inhaling the mingled stench of burnt asbestos-flavored dust and decade-old recycled tread was a welcome relief I savored as if it were a fresh-baked blueberry pie. The 18-wheeler was the only other vehicle on the highway, and the out-of-tune screeching of brittle rubber composed the string section that accompanied the light show. The year was 2001, and although I had yet to show any of the progressive disabling symptoms of having multiple sclerosis, I was riding a motorcycle that most certainly did. It wasn’t the first time I shouted, “You Commie bastard!” But this time it was forceful enough to fog my face shield. I realized for the first time in almost two years of planning that my attempt to ride a Russian Ural in the Iron Butt Rally was insane, absurd and appeared to be grinding itself to an embarrassing finale. As the Earth beneath me stopped rotating, the sparks fizzled out, and the music died. The show was over. Nothing to see here. My attempt at finishing the World’s Toughest Motorcycle Competition was ending in the gutter. But it wasn’t for lack of trying. Within hours of the starting pistol, I had experienced a seized motor and the joy of a 150-mile tow in the wrong direction. A stranger with matching DNA transplanted his personal bike’s engine into my frame to help get me back on the road. Not bothering to do a proper test run on the older engine, I rode all night with a rough running motor and electrical issues, including no taillights. After a half hour’s rest in a dingy truck stop, I wasted four hours just trying to start the bike, alternating kicking and swearing with resting and praying before it haphazardly coughed to life. And now, a series of dips in the road caused the front end of my overloaded combative camel to oscillate into a crunchy wobble that intensified into a tank slapper and spit me off. “If life were easy, everyone would get one.”. 	1	1	Long|Haul|Paul|:|Riding|a|Million|Miles|for|the|Cure	Words|by|Paul|Pelland|||.|Photos|by|Matt|Kiedaisch|.|As|I|slid|down|a|lonely|Arkansas|highway|just|as|the|sun|’|s|warmth|was|cresting|the|horizon|,|I|couldn|’|t|help|but|think|this|may|not|have|been|one|of|my|better|ideas|.|If|I|managed|to|live|through|the|next|few|seconds|,|not|only|would|the|entire|world|know|I|was|an|idiot|,|I|would|have|one|hell|of|a|long|walk|home|.|I|slid|on|my|chest|in|slow|motion|,|my|motorcycle|just|a|few|feet|ahead|of|me|shedding|pounds|by|the|foot|,|marring|the|pavement|while|creating|a|fantastic|light|show|.|Bright|,|colorful|sparks|,|the|likes|of|which|no|Japanese|bike|could|ever|create|.|The|bike|was|veering|toward|the|right|shoulder|like|an|obedient|pigeon|,|and|I|dragged|my|right|boot|like|a|rudder|to|follow|it|to|its|familiar|home|,|the|breakdown|lane|.|Every|believing|biker|knows|tractor-trailers|would|never|be|allowed|to|drive|past|the|pearly|gates|,|so|inhaling|the|mingled|stench|of|burnt|asbestos-flavored|dust|and|decade-old|recycled|tread|was|a|welcome|relief|I|savored|as|if|it|were|a|fresh-baked|blueberry|pie|.|The|18|-|wheeler|was|the|only|other|vehicle|on|the|highway|,|and|the|out-of-tune|screeching|of|brittle|rubber|composed|the|string|section|that|accompanied|the|light|show|.|The|year|was|2001|,|and|although|I|had|yet|to|show|any|of|the|progressive|disabling|symptoms|of|having|multiple|sclerosis|,|I|was|riding|a|motorcycle|that|most|certainly|did|.|It|wasn|’|t|the|first|time|I|shouted|,|“|You|Commie|bastard|!|”|But|this|time|it|was|forceful|enough|to|fog|my|face|shield|.|I|realized|for|the|first|time|in|almost|two|years|of|planning|that|my|attempt|to|ride|a|Russian|Ural|in|the|Iron|Butt|Rally|was|insane|,|absurd|and|appeared|to|be|grinding|itself|to|an|embarrassing|finale|.|As|the|Earth|beneath|me|stopped|rotating|,|the|sparks|fizzled|out|,|and|the|music|died|.|The|show|was|over|.|Nothing|to|see|here|.|My|attempt|at|finishing|the|World|’|s|Toughest|Motorcycle|Competition|was|ending|in|the|gutter|.|But|it|wasn|’|t|for|lack|of|trying|.|Within|hours|of|the|starting|pistol|,|I|had|experienced|a|seized|motor|and|the|joy|of|a|150|-|mile|tow|in|the|wrong|direction|.|A|stranger|with|matching|DNA|transplanted|his|personal|bike|’|s|engine|into|my|frame|to|help|get|me|back|on|the|road|.|Not|bothering|to|do|a|proper|test|run|on|the|older|engine|,|I|rode|all|night|with|a|rough|running|motor|and|electrical|issues|,|including|no|taillights|.|After|a|half|hour|’|s|rest|in|a|dingy|truck|stop|,|I|wasted|four|hours|just|trying|to|start|the|bike|,|alternating|kicking|and|swearing|with|resting|and|praying|before|it|haphazardly|coughed|to|life|.|And|now|,|a|series|of|dips|in|the|road|caused|the|front|end|of|my|overloaded|combative|camel|to|oscillate|into|a|crunchy|wobble|that|intensified|into|a|tank|slapper|and|spit|me|off|.|“|If|life|were|easy|,|everyone|would|get|one|.|”|.

Helping Everyone Affected by Multiple Sclerosis. Friday March 30 2018 12:19 PM. Sensory Café Captures Customers ‘Experiencing’ Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Symptoms. Captivating video unveiled to show the day-to-day impact of living with MS. A sensory-experience café popped-up on Exchequer Street, Dublin 2 on Wednesday, 28th March, to give customers a truly impactful insight into the everyday challenges of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This thought-provoking video shows their reactions and interactions in the MSunderstood Café. The experiential Café aimed to give customers a taste of MS to highlight the urgent need for improved access to medicine and for the management of MS. Over 9,000 people are living with MS in Ireland, with thousands more family members affected, yet Ireland faces the worst access delays to new medicines in Western Europe. Speaking at the opening Karen Hynes, who lives with MS, said “This MSunderstood Café means the world to me as it shows a day in the life that I go through on a daily basis.”. The experiment involved replacing the menu boards, coffee mugs, floors and furniture with specially-created materials and followed customers as they tried to enjoy their coffee break. The simulated environment was created with people with MS to ensure all aspects of the café were as true to life as possible. The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland (MS Ireland), in partnership with Roche, opened the Café as people with MS (PwMS) need, expect and deserve quick access to new and effective treatments through a fair and sustainable system. A new website - PatientsDeserveBetter.ie - was also launched to help those affected by MS demand quick and better access to new medicine. Watch the full video to see people’s reactions to visiting the MSunderstood Café.

Before a potential new medicine can be used to help treat patients, it must go through a series of studies in people. Volunteers like you who take part in clinical trials make valuable contributions to advancing the understanding of diseases and the discovery of new or improved treatments. How your participation helps. Each year, millions of people help advance medical science by volunteering to take part in clinical trials. While there are many reasons for participating, all who volunteer contribute valuable information to help researchers find better treatments that may improve lives.

The laboratory-generated antibody GNbAC1 continued to limit brain shrinkage a year after relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients began receiving it, its developers announced. GeNeuro and Servier were reporting on the 12-month results of a Phase 2b clinical trial. GNbAC1 is a monoclonal antibody that destroys a harmful retroviral protein called pHERV-W which scientists have linked to brain lesions in MS patients. Lesions are areas where the myelin coating that protects nerve cells has deteriorated. The Phase 2b CHANGE-MS trial ( NCT02782858 ), conducted in 12 European countries, involved 270 RRMS patients. Researchers randomized them to receive the antibody or a placebo once a month by intravenous infusion. GeNeuro and Servier said a year’s worth of GNbAC1 led to much brain loss among MS patients than a regimen consisting of six months of a placebo and six months of the antibody. The difference in brain atrophy was 31 percent in the brain’s cortical area and 72 percent in the thalamic areas.

Predicting Episodic Memory Loss in Patients with MS. Mult Scler; ePub 2018 Mar 7; Koenig, et al. March 20, 2018. Functional activation may be useful as a predictive measure of episodic memory loss in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), a recent study found. Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a verbal episodic memory task, lesion load, and volumetric measures of the hippocampus and thalamus to assess the relative contributions to verbal and visual-spatial episodic memory in persons with MS (n=32) and healthy controls (n=16). They found:. MS Views and News provides Multiple Sclerosis education, information, resources and services that will benefit many affected by MS. Posted by Stuart at March 25, 2018. Sun Exposure Associated with Lower MS Risk. Neurology; ePub 2018 Mar 7; Tremlett, et al. Living in high ambient UV-B areas during childhood and the years leading up to multiple sclerosis (MS) onset was associated with a lower MS risk, according to a recent study. Furthermore, high summer sun exposure in high ambient UV-B areas was also associated with a reduced risk. Persons with MS (n=151) and age-matched controls (n=235) from the Nurses' Health Study cohorts completed questionnaires that assessed summer, winter, and lifetime sun exposure history. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated via conditional logistic regression with adjustment for body mass index, ancestry, smoking, and vitamin D supplementation.

Niall Moloney, 4th year Occupational Student, NUI Galway is looking for participants to engage in a research study. Who can participate? The participants for this particular study are children of people with MS who are aged between 18 and 30 years. Aim of study. The study seeks to explore young adults lived experiences and perceptions of parental multiple sclerosis and how it impacted and/or impacts on them. It is anticipated that this study will inform service provision regarding areas in which young adults who experience parental MS may require support. What do I have to do? Young adult participants aged between 18-30 years, will be asked to engage in short individual interviews and complete a demographic questionnaire. We are asking if you have children within this age group who might be interested in participating in this project and if so, would you pass on this information. How to get involved.
