I'm younger than you father (46, PD since 41) but I also have a 21 year old son. First I want to say it sounds like you are amazingly helpful and supportive - he is lucky to have you! Definitely exercise as everyone else has mentioned helps both physical and dementia symptoms. There is also a supplement that helps quite a bit that my doc ( who is one of the only naturopaths during PD research and is sponsored by the MJFox foundation - she studies how to slow progression) Dr. Laurie Mischley recommends for preventing dementia called citicoline. I take 1 gram a day (500mg twice a day). It is used in Europe but not well known in the US. This is long but talks about her research on what slows progression.

Exercise is good. We can produce our own dopemine and seratonine by excercise. Both help with parkinson's, so the ""keep moving"" isn't just a flippant remark but is the best medicine we can do. I keep pushing my self. Walking, hiking, Jogging, Cycling, and Swimming. I'll do two of those a day. I've had some very odd issues, so need to talk to docs. Last week went for a late afternoon run (meds worn off, trying to push myself) but found my legs felt like they were in wet concrete. Slowest run every (5K takes me 42 minutes taking it easy, but this was over 50 minutes). Wasn't until I looked at my heart rate (much higher than normal) did I realize something else was at play. I had a two days of diarrhea (sorry, TMI) but it was my system was totally out of wack. I just tried pushing through, but heart rate said I was overdoing it. I'll track my HR and will use that for my medical summary (I do a two page summary. ""Why am I here today"" ""what do I hope to resolve"" ""what is my follow up"" Then quick summary of what changed since last appoint, what I have been doing exercise/work, meds (docs name, amount, why prescribed) and who I have seen (Docs name, specialty, one line summary). I have issue that seem neither Parkinsons, nor cancer related, so it is critical to have my team of docs all understand what is going one. My gastro issues seems to make more sense being Parkinson's related, but oh crap I feel like a professional patient. Hence new docs like that ""at a glance"" overview and helps keep appointments on track and productive.

Symptoms were slow movement and tightness in my left arm and hand. Very little ability to use my arm, no arm swing. Essential tremor, no resting tremors. Spread to my leg. Quad tightness and restlessness. Strong family history (grandfather, uncle, mother, brother) as well. We did an MRI which was useless. I was diagnosed in one neurologist visit. I was then transferred to a local PD specialty center. The new doctor confirmed the initial diagnosis through a genetic blood test. I have a mutation in a certain gene that is pretty much only present in people with PD and it is 50/50 whether you get that mutation from the affected parent. My suggestion would be to talk to your doc about this test (mine was free through my insurance) and if they still dismiss you or won't do it, go elsewhere. Anecdotally I started sinemet and it was useless. Weaned off of that and started Artane. Felt amazing from the first dose. Like I turned back the clock 5 years.

Parkinson's is a possibility, but could be other things too that more medically qualified people can comment on. If you can't get your PCP to refer you, get a second opinion. You are your most valuable asset, so get it checked out. If you thought a mechanic was giving you shifty advice you'd get a second opinion right? PD cannot be ruled out on age basis alone.

While I don't really remember him pre-diagnosis, I don't think his day-to-day changed all that much, at least in the first decade or so. He was always very active, which I'm sure helped. As it progressed, he took some fall-prevention classes and they made some minor changes to the house. Grab bars in the bathrooms, fewer rugs, taller chairs, that sort of thing. When mobility became an issue he started using sticks, then ski poles, and eventually this neat walker designed for folks with PD. From the caretaker side of things, my mom read up on the science and made an effort to keep up with changes in the field over the years. She's not a science-oriented person by any stretch, but she felt it helped her take a more active role in his care. I know that meant a tremendous amount to him. Every case is different, of course, but that's my family's experience.

I’ll do some research. How I figured this out was that the only two things in six years that helped me were a dopamine supplement and an acetylcholine reducing asthma inhaler. Which a nurse friend mentioned is increased with eggs and reduces dopamine levels. Interesting as that’s generally what PD patients are treated with. I thought I had PD. A few docs mentioned it. Then I saw a doc last week who said he wanted to inject my back with an acetylcholine reducer. I perked up. What’s acetylcholine? What increases it. So I googled. Fatty meats, dairy, and eggs. I have an appt with my doc next week to discuss it. All I know is that after four days of not eating meat I feel kinda normal for the first time in six years and my muscles have stopped flipping out twenty four seven. I can relax and take a deep breath. Things to consider. Why take a dopamine enhancer and an acetylcholine reducer when you could simply eat way less meat?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4721816922399789110/diploid_impunity-re:-Nightmares-from-medication	diploid_impunity re: Nightmares from medication	My mom was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease with dementia, but one of her doctor's thought she had Lewy Body Dementia rather than Parkinson's. I think that doctor was wrong, actually, but I did ask her whether it would make any difference to my mom's treatment, since most of the same drugs are used in the treatment of the two diseases. The doctor said there was one drug my mom was taking (maybe Seroquel, but don't quote me on that) that she didn't like to use with LBD patients, because it caused them to have frightening delusions and nightmares, and could be substituted for with another drug. Maybe you should ask your Dad's doctor if it's possible your Dad has LBD rather than (or in addition to?) PD, or if a drug substitution could be tried. From my (weak) understanding of the difference between PD and LBD, it has to do with whether the dementia showed up before (LBD) or after (PD) the more Parkinsonian symptoms, such as tremor, did. 	1	1	diploid_impunity|re|:|Nightmares|from|medication	My|mom|was|diagnosed|with|Parkinson's|Disease|with|dementia|,|but|one|of|her|doctor's|thought|she|had|Lewy|Body|Dementia|rather|than|Parkinson's|.|I|think|that|doctor|was|wrong|,|actually|,|but|I|did|ask|her|whether|it|would|make|any|difference|to|my|mom's|treatment|,|since|most|of|the|same|drugs|are|used|in|the|treatment|of|the|two|diseases|.|The|doctor|said|there|was|one|drug|my|mom|was|taking|(|maybe|Seroquel|,|but|don't|quote|me|on|that|)|that|she|didn't|like|to|use|with|LBD|patients|,|because|it|caused|them|to|have|frightening|delusions|and|nightmares|,|and|could|be|substituted|for|with|another|drug|.|Maybe|you|should|ask|your|Dad's|doctor|if|it's|possible|your|Dad|has|LBD|rather|than|(|or|in|addition|to|?|)|PD|,|or|if|a|drug|substitution|could|be|tried|.|From|my|(|weak|)|understanding|of|the|difference|between|PD|and|LBD|,|it|has|to|do|with|whether|the|dementia|showed|up|before|(|LBD|)|or|after|(|PD|)|the|more|Parkinsonian|symptoms|,|such|as|tremor|,|did|.

My mum has had PD nearing 20 years now, she's done well but has bad balance, pain in her foot when she walks (dystonia) and is on a duodopa pump since November. She's tough as balls and hella funny and sweet, but the symptoms are getting her down. Especially the strong movements/wriggling (dyskenesia) the past week, have been really strong and long lasting especially at night time when she just wants to relax. We (me and my sister) are with her all the time and I'm gonna call the doctor tomorrow to ask him about it (might be something to do with the pump or other medications) but wanted to know if y'all had any advice/scoops on how to somewhat quickly lessen these symptoms so she can sleep at night?

It's really nice knowing there are so many of you here providing support and advice. As for my dad, I think that exercising and keeping active shouldn't be too much of a problem for him since he is a person who enjoys it. But the fact that my siblings and me are starting to get older and more independent does have an affect on him. I'm still relatively young so the pressure from school added on with my dad's PD just got me stressed out a bit. I'm sure I will be able to handle it though. My dad is doing really good right now in my opinion so I hope this continues on.

(I'm part of a lot of facebook support groups with over 200k members). My dad had PD for 12 years (he had over complications that were unrelated to PD that led to him passing away) but was healthy and moving around a lot. Certain accommodations had to be made, like adding a handrail to the stairs and such, but overall he would still go on 10m bike rides 10years after being diagnosed. Make sure he keeps exercising because I firmly believe that's crucial for the wellbeing/health of people with PD. As long as he stays active, mentally and physically, he's doing the most he can to slow his progression. As a daughter, I would say prepare for the worst, and know it's long off in the distance. Carbi Levodopa is the main drug and later on, if his symptoms get worse, there are other drugs/treatments available (like DBS surgery). I know there are a lot of trials and studies going on for PD right now, so hopefully a breakthrough happens soon and we can be on our way to learning how to better medically treat PD!

While nothing we currently have can stop or even slow disease progress measurably, it’s important to understand that (overall) patients will generally be better at all points through their disease in terms of motor control with DBS than without it. In other words, the DBS still helps even though the disease gets worse over time. It’s not as if DBS stops working or that significant tolerance develops to it. So, yes, medication and device adjustments will always be required due to the fact that PD is a progressive disorder— but not because DBS is temporary. (You seem to understand that but it can be confusing, so it’s good to be clear so people don’t get the wrong impression that they should ‘save’ DBS for later, or have it removed, or not get it at all because it doesn’t last, etc.). 	1	1	mudfud|27|re|:|Dad|with|Parkinson|’|s|,|super|fast|progression	Quite|true|,|but|the|improvement|from|DBS|does|not|wane|.|While|nothing|we|currently|have|can|stop|or|even|slow|disease|progress|measurably|,|it|’|s|important|to|understand|that|(|overall|)|patients|will|generally|be|better|at|all|points|through|their|disease|in|terms|of|motor|control|with|DBS|than|without|it|.|In|other|words|,|the|DBS|still|helps|even|though|the|disease|gets|worse|over|time|.|It|’|s|not|as|if|DBS|stops|working|or|that|significant|tolerance|develops|to|it|.|So|,|yes|,|medication|and|device|adjustments|will|always|be|required|due|to|the|fact|that|PD|is|a|progressive|disorder|—|but|not|because|DBS|is|temporary|.|(|You|seem|to|understand|that|but|it|can|be|confusing|,|so|it|’|s|good|to|be|clear|so|people|don|’|t|get|the|wrong|impression|that|they|should|‘|save|’|DBS|for|later|,|or|have|it|removed|,|or|not|get|it|at|all|because|it|doesn|’|t|last|,|etc|.|)|.

Might be time to look for home care for him. I personally do not suggest putting him into a home unless home care is completely impossible.

What do you think? **Medical students' disease** Medical students' disease (also known as second year syndrome or intern's syndrome) is a condition frequently reported in medical students, who perceive themselves to be experiencing the symptoms of a disease that they are studying. The condition is associated with the fear of contracting the disease in question. Some authors suggested that the condition must be referred to as nosophobia rather than ""hypochondriasis"", because the quoted studies show a very low percentage of hypochondriacal character of the condition, and hence the term ""hypochondriasis"" would have ominous therapeutic and prognostic indications. The reference suggests that the condition is associated with immediate preoccupation with the symptoms in question, leading the student to become unduly aware of various casual psychological and physiological dysfunctions; cases show little correlation with the severity of psychopathology, but rather with accidental factors related to learning and experience. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose? to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose? to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28.

Here, we report a fasting mimicking diet (FMD), fasting 3 days followed by 4 days of refeeding for three 1-week cycles, which accelerated the retention of motor function and attenuated the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrathydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), known to promote the survival of dopaminergic neurons, were increased in PD mice after FMD, suggesting an involvement of BDNF in FMD-mediated neuroprotection. Furthermore, FMD decreased the number of glial cells as well as the release of TNF-α and IL-1β in PD mice, showing that FMD also inhibited neuro-inflammation. 16S and 18S rRNA sequencing of fecal microbiota showed that FMD treatment modulated the shifts in gut microbiota composition, including higher abundance of Firmicutes, Tenericutes, and Opisthokonta and lower abundance of Proteobacteria at the phylum level in PD mice. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that FMD modulated the MPTP-induced lower propionic acid and isobutyric acid, and higher butyric acid and valeric acid and other metabolites. Transplantation of fecal microbiota, from normal mice with FMD treatment to antibiotic-pretreated PD mice increased dopamine levels in the recipient PD mice, suggesting that gut microbiota contributed to the neuroprotection of FMD for PD. **These findings demonstrate that FMD can be a new means of preventing and treating PD through promoting a favorable gut microbiota composition and metabolites**. 	1	0	MaximilianKohler|re|:|Transplantation|of|fecal|microbiota|,|from|normal|mice|on|Fasting|Mimicking|Diet|-|FMD|-|to|antibiotic-pretreated|Parkinson|’|s|Disease|-|PD|-|mice|increased|dopamine|levels|in|the|recipient|PD|mice|,|suggesting|that|gut|microbiota|contributed|to|the|neuroprotection|of|FMD|for|PD|-|Feb|2019	*|*|Study|*|*|:|Neuroprotection|of|Fasting|Mimicking|Diet|on|MPTP-Induced|Parkinson|’|s|Disease|Mice|via|Gut|Microbiota|and|Metabolites|>|.|*|*|Abstract|*|*|>|.|>|Parkinson|’|s|disease|(|PD|)|is|strongly|associated|with|life|style|,|especially|dietary|habits|,|which|have|gained|attention|as|disease|modifiers|.|Here|,|we|report|a|fasting|mimicking|diet|(|FMD|)|,|fasting|3|days|followed|by|4|days|of|refeeding|for|three|1|-|week|cycles|,|which|accelerated|the|retention|of|motor|function|and|attenuated|the|loss|of|dopaminergic|neurons|in|the|substantia|nigra|in|1|-|methyl|-|4|-|phenyl|-1,2|,|3,6-|tetrathydropyridine|(|MPTP|)|-|induced|PD|mice|.|Levels|of|brain-derived|neurotrophic|factor|(|BDNF|)|,|known|to|promote|the|survival|of|dopaminergic|neurons|,|were|increased|in|PD|mice|after|FMD|,|suggesting|an|involvement|of|BDNF|in|FMD-mediated|neuroprotection|.|Furthermore|,|FMD|decreased|the|number|of|glial|cells|as|well|as|the|release|of|TNF-α|and|IL|-|1β|in|PD|mice|,|showing|that|FMD|also|inhibited|neuro-inflammation|.|16S|and|18S|rRNA|sequencing|of|fecal|microbiota|showed|that|FMD|treatment|modulated|the|shifts|in|gut|microbiota|composition|,|including|higher|abundance|of|Firmicutes|,|Tenericutes|,|and|Opisthokonta|and|lower|abundance|of|Proteobacteria|at|the|phylum|level|in|PD|mice|.|Gas|chromatography-mass|spectrometry|and|liquid|chromatography-mass|spectrometry|revealed|that|FMD|modulated|the|MPTP-induced|lower|propionic|acid|and|isobutyric|acid|,|and|higher|butyric|acid|and|valeric|acid|and|other|metabolites|.|Transplantation|of|fecal|microbiota|,|from|normal|mice|with|FMD|treatment|to|antibiotic-pretreated|PD|mice|increased|dopamine|levels|in|the|recipient|PD|mice|,|suggesting|that|gut|microbiota|contributed|to|the|neuroprotection|of|FMD|for|PD|.|*|*|These|findings|demonstrate|that|FMD|can|be|a|new|means|of|preventing|and|treating|PD|through|promoting|a|favorable|gut|microbiota|composition|and|metabolites|*|*|.

Research has shown that exercise may have protective effects, reducing the risk of developing PD, and exercise has also been shown to relieve some of the motor symptoms of PD. Regular aerobic exercise and strength training can help to improve strength, flexibility, and balance — as well as fight depression — in people with Parkinson's disease.

So, I deal with the usual Parkinson's constipation. 2 weeks ago, I remembered when I was working, I would use small candy, (i.e. tictacs...) that wouldn't interfere with my voice on the phone. Once my wife accidentally bought sugar free werthers and I had loose bowels from the sugar alcohols. So I got some more. But also fat free potato chips and ice cream with carrageenin. With constipation, eatting food that's supposed to cause diarrhea, could help. So far, so good. My wife has me also taking vitamin C, 500mg every 2 hours until movement. Welcome to the sub. Best of luck with your symptoms and God bless. 	1	1	catherded|re|:|Didn|’|t|take|but|a|couple|of|posts|w|/|comments|to|realize|as|though|I|have|found|a|whole|population|of|folks|that|go|thru|the|daily|PD|grind|as|we|do|.|My|wife|the|care|giver|and|me|the|guy|with|Parkinson|’|s|…|…|you|all|have|my|attention	catherded|re|:|Didn|’|t|take|but|a|couple|of|posts|w|/|comments|to|realize|as|though|I|have|found|a|whole|population|of|folks|that|go|thru|the|daily|PD|grind|as|we|do|.|My|wife|the|care|giver|and|me|the|guy|with|Parkinson|’|s|…|…|you|all|have|my|attention|.|Open|forum|?|I'm|not|a|doctor|.|So|,|I|deal|with|the|usual|Parkinson's|constipation|.|2|weeks|ago|,|I|remembered|when|I|was|working|,|I|would|use|small|candy|,|(|i|.|e|.|tictacs|...|)|that|wouldn't|interfere|with|my|voice|on|the|phone|.|Once|my|wife|accidentally|bought|sugar|free|werthers|and|I|had|loose|bowels|from|the|sugar|alcohols|.|So|I|got|some|more|.|But|also|fat|free|potato|chips|and|ice|cream|with|carrageenin|.|With|constipation|,|eatting|food|that's|supposed|to|cause|diarrhea|,|could|help|.|So|far|,|so|good|.|My|wife|has|me|also|taking|vitamin|C|,|500mg|every|2|hours|until|movement|.|Welcome|to|the|sub|.|Best|of|luck|with|your|symptoms|and|God|bless|.

Ideally have someone with you at all appointments to take notes.

Klonopin for anxiety and Flexeril and Celexa. He sometimes has wild fits after he takes the Sinemet, — where his arm swings and leg does it's own dance. Then his arm will spasm and flex and his hand clench into a fist. Today this lasted 4 hours. It came back again, hours later, without having taken his next Sinemet dose. The Dr seems dismissive... my friend has a lot of anxiety over his PD and his symptoms. He just cannot seem to get stable. Today the Dr ordered Requip — my friend doesn't know if he is supposed to take Requip *and* Sinemet or drop Sinemet and take Requip? The nurse didn't have answers... he's going to ask the Pharmacist. Any insight on this amount and types of meds and his symptoms would be helpful! He doesn't know if he is pestering the doctor or if he is right to expect stability and be concerned? 	1	1	Meds|input	My|friend|has|been|on|Sinemet|(|IR|)|for|~|3|years|.|He|also|takes|Ambien|and|Trazodone|for|sleep|.|Klonopin|for|anxiety|and|Flexeril|and|Celexa|.|He|sometimes|has|wild|fits|after|he|takes|the|Sinemet|,|—|where|his|arm|swings|and|leg|does|it's|own|dance|.|Then|his|arm|will|spasm|and|flex|and|his|hand|clench|into|a|fist|.|Today|this|lasted|4|hours|.|It|came|back|again|,|hours|later|,|without|having|taken|his|next|Sinemet|dose|.|The|Dr|seems|dismissive|...|my|friend|has|a|lot|of|anxiety|over|his|PD|and|his|symptoms|.|He|just|cannot|seem|to|get|stable|.|Today|the|Dr|ordered|Requip|—|my|friend|doesn't|know|if|he|is|supposed|to|take|Requip|*|and|*|Sinemet|or|drop|Sinemet|and|take|Requip|?|The|nurse|didn't|have|answers|...|he's|going|to|ask|the|Pharmacist|.|Any|insight|on|this|amount|and|types|of|meds|and|his|symptoms|would|be|helpful|!|He|doesn't|know|if|he|is|pestering|the|doctor|or|if|he|is|right|to|expect|stability|and|be|concerned|?

While my symptoms are fairly mild compared to others, I do have the feeling of my body going into the abyss, as you put it. I feel betrayed by my brain. I know I should be happy and living my best life but honestly, I still haven't come to terms with having PD and I constantly think of how my future will look as my tremors get worse, my gait becomes more shuff-ley, and how I will inevitably become more freez-ey.

Does it happen that people with PD first get misdiagnosed with ASD and/or ADHD-I?	"So, last year at the age of 40 I was diagnosed with ASD and possibly ADD. (ADHD-I) I was getting increased troubles at work and I needed to know what was wrong me. But personally, I only recognize just a few of the symptoms of both. Moreover, I have a couple of symptoms that don't add up. I have a slight degradation of motor skills in the few recent years. And my memory and thinking seem to deteriorate. Very recently I was prescribed with wellbutrin to combat my sudden severe lack of motivation, a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor which resulted in a slight improvement! I went five years back in time to my normal me. My autism didn't pose such a big of a problem anymore, but you can't ""get"" ASD, and you can't cure it either. It's frustrating that there's no simple blood-test for any of these! Could it be that I have early onset PD instead? Is this a common or realistic scenario?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4712426466294216677/ParkieDude-re:-Work	ParkieDude re: Work	"I told people ""too much coffee, not enough sleep"" for years. I traveled non-stop as an Field Applications Engineer so people assumed it was exhaustion. It was, but PD was playing a role. First thing you might want to consider is learning ""what are my rights"". Employment Lawyers are good. Once you have an official DX of Parkinson's (don't rush it!) then it is time to spend $500 for a two hour consultation with an employment lawyer. HR works for your company, not you. They are there to protect the company, so it is only fair we talk to a legal console and know our rights. Texas is a right to work state. So you can hire/fire/quit at any time. Catch is with Parkinson's they can not fire due to medical ""Hey, you have Parkinson's we don't want your working here any more"" but they can terminate with ""Sorry we had to let 10% of the workforce go, you are in that 10%"". So it's a fine line. My old company was that first group. Oh, you can't do your job (travel in the field, you're history). Irony is my idiot bosses who did that crap were all history when we were bought out by a new company. New company is great to work for and is more focused on team players and was more like ""what can be do to make your job easier"" first to admit a nice breath of fresh air. Oh, HR knows I have Parkinson's. A few people thought my gait, slurred words, and tremor were due to alcohol, so I started getting the emails about how we have programs to help with addiction. Sigh. Finally came clean it was Parkinson's, so no issues but more ""how do we help"". These days I do self report as ""disabled"" which actually helps them with EOE and diverse employment issues. They have been great. &#x200B; \*Dx of Parkinson's means life insurance is more expensive. It is cheap to buy a 20 or 30 year term life insurance policy when you are 40 years old. I had to have a physical, passed it, and had life insurance. I didn't have that official DX for another five years so I was covered with cheap life insurance for the rest of the policy. None of us every plan to be killed in car accident or from other issues like cancer, but as I get old we will have more safety net (paid off house, supplemental retirement) so life insurance isn't as critical. /r/FIRE is a good sub for Financial Independence / Retire Early. Still good tips even if you plan to work until age 70.

He finally did tell them and everyone was supportive, some even saying that they had spotted his symptoms and we're waiting for him to tell them. He had to make a few changes regarding his driving license but that was it.

It is an atypical, and has (along with clozapine) the lowest propensity for causing extrapyramidal side effects (ie, worsening motor symptoms) and the least effect on neuroleptic sensitivity (the “bad effect” referenced for haloperidol above) of any drugs in this class. Quetiapine is very commonly used in DLB. It was really the only practical option for a long time. Pimavanserin is a new drug that has anti-psychosis effects but has a very different mechanism of action from any of the drugs traditionally grouped in that category— it has no effect on dopamine receptors. Instead, it is an “inverse agonist” (reduces activity below baseline) at serotonin receptors (5HT2A specifically). It has a specific FDA indication in PD psychosis due to this non-dopaminergic activity. In my experience it is not as powerful as quetiapine in treating florid hallucinations, but can be quite helpful with managing delusions, “sense of presence”, and other more mild manifestations of psychosis. Some patients experience improvement in delusions and clarity of thought with a cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) as well, but the effect is usually quite mild. Although these drugs were originally approved for cognitive support in Alzheimer's disease I will say they actually seem somewhat more effective in PDD than AD (I don't think there is literature to back that up; more anecdotal). Hope that's helpful. I know it's not easy to deal with these kinds of symptoms. As important as dealing with motor symptoms of PD is, your doctors should be addressing these (oftentimes more bothersome) non motor issues too. All the best. 	1	1	mudfud|27|re|:|Parkinson|’|s|with|Lewy|body|dementia|advice	Quetiapine|is|an|antipsychotic|.|It|is|an|atypical|,|and|has|(|along|with|clozapine|)|the|lowest|propensity|for|causing|extrapyramidal|side|effects|(|ie|,|worsening|motor|symptoms|)|and|the|least|effect|on|neuroleptic|sensitivity|(|the|“|bad|effect|”|referenced|for|haloperidol|above|)|of|any|drugs|in|this|class|.|Quetiapine|is|very|commonly|used|in|DLB|.|It|was|really|the|only|practical|option|for|a|long|time|.|Pimavanserin|is|a|new|drug|that|has|anti-psychosis|effects|but|has|a|very|different|mechanism|of|action|from|any|of|the|drugs|traditionally|grouped|in|that|category|—|it|has|no|effect|on|dopamine|receptors|.|Instead|,|it|is|an|“|inverse|agonist|”|(|reduces|activity|below|baseline|)|at|serotonin|receptors|(|5HT2A|specifically|)|.|It|has|a|specific|FDA|indication|in|PD|psychosis|due|to|this|non-dopaminergic|activity|.|In|my|experience|it|is|not|as|powerful|as|quetiapine|in|treating|florid|hallucinations|,|but|can|be|quite|helpful|with|managing|delusions|,|“|sense|of|presence|”|,|and|other|more|mild|manifestations|of|psychosis|.|Some|patients|experience|improvement|in|delusions|and|clarity|of|thought|with|a|cholinesterase|inhibitor|(|donepezil|,|rivastigmine|,|galantamine|)|as|well|,|but|the|effect|is|usually|quite|mild|.|Although|these|drugs|were|originally|approved|for|cognitive|support|in|Alzheimer's|disease|I|will|say|they|actually|seem|somewhat|more|effective|in|PDD|than|AD|(|I|don't|think|there|is|literature|to|back|that|up|;|more|anecdotal|)|.|Hope|that's|helpful|.|I|know|it's|not|easy|to|deal|with|these|kinds|of|symptoms|.|As|important|as|dealing|with|motor|symptoms|of|PD|is|,|your|doctors|should|be|addressing|these|(|oftentimes|more|bothersome|)|non|motor|issues|too|.|All|the|best|.

Antipsychotic agents may be indicated if psychotic symptoms are severe and pose a significant safety risk. AVOIDtraditional antipsychotic agents (e.g., haloperidol).

It has a an adverse effect on our cognitive functioning, yet is the first thing ER Physicians grab when they have a combative patient. Highly effective for Alzheimer, but horrible for Parkinson's/Lewy Body. Parkinson's Disease is when we have a bush on fire, Lewy Body Dementia is like the whole forest is on fire. We can control it for so long, but sadly long term care facilities are needed towards the end. Not something we wish on anyone, it just damn hard. PDD (Parkinson's Disease with Dementia) means Parkinson's symptoms started first. Not everyone with PD develops into PDD; Lewy Body Dementia (LDB) is when cognitive and Parkinson's Symptoms develop at the same time.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4710656941314059602/Obedient_Human-re:-Cannabis-and-Parkinson's	Obedient_Human re: Cannabis and Parkinson's	From my limited experience, the CBD can be effective for some people for the pain, but because for so many years there was stigma around cannabis research did stall on understanding the mechanisms of how the system naturally works in the nervous system. Since PD is so much more likely to have medication interactions with condition (because dopamine is the center of everything, here...), CBD may be a way to bypass the dopamine system. I wish there was more research out there. If there is a lot of muscle rigidity, getting the neurologist to first understand/make sure other medications couldn't be better timed may make a big difference. Personally, for a completely different nerve-overactivation-pain condition I have, I have found a CBD balm that is non-cannabis derived to be very effective. It is actually found in algae that are on an invasive pine tree! In this way, since it is not derived from cannabis, and is topical/only locally acting, it seems the most likely to be non-psychoactive in a way that could be good for those with parkinsons. I have given this balm to my friend's father with stage 5 PD, and he finds it helps. For the toe-curling that happens in some cases of PD, there is a paper I found that talked about how botox of all things was effective. (Crazy, right??) But it kind of makes sense to me. It is locally acting on the nerve without being systemic or going back to the brain. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed/29102441](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed/29102441) &#x200B; Good luck.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4710490433823262464/Having-a-hard-time-finding-palliativehospice-care-for-end-stage-parkinson's-disease-...	Having a hard time finding palliative/hospice care for end stage parkinson's disease ...	Hi there, First post, and I wish it were of something better or different. I'm trying to support a friend, as I had my dad pass away last year and know how the process is just .... trying. But I was on the east coast then. Here I'm on the west coast and I would think people would be more advanced or caring somehow... but that hasn't been what this family has experienced. My heart is breaking for them.   I have been helping them out for the last month, and got her dad out of the hospital. He was being physically and chemically restrained to be just 'quiet' and easier for the staff to deal with. I'd never met him before.... but I can tell you by the time I got his neurologist there and acting responsibly, he changed dramatically in a day. People don't understand that parkinson's meds need to be given regularly. He was missing meds for days and he was lucky to make it home at all.   Transitioning to home hospice we hoped would be better... because how could it not? That was something. But I'm struggling here seeing that this guy has great healthcare coverage (not actually medicare eligible and has private insurance), and has long term care through his work for being a state engineer. These are down to earth, sweet, caring public servants... and I'm watching in horror as they get run over. He is suddenly bed bound and unable to do anything much for himself, and his wife had emergency surgery and needed extra help. I showed up and been trying really hard to do something, to get some help. There was supposed to be a meeting with the hospice group to assign respite care in the morning, and that night we were stranded and I got lucky with finding a care agency to pay out of pocket for help so he wouldn't have to sit in his own waste all night long.   But the morning meeting never happened. Instead, they waited and waited until the end of the afternoon, and called not his daughter or myself who had been reaching out to them, but the wife who has been I think tearing stitches from being unable to rest after the surprise cancer surgery... and unceremoniously dumping him from their hospice service. I have a day and a half, not even, to somehow get a hospital bed for this guy and people to help put him into it, never mind all the rest. And he's fully aware and able to talk and reason and say how he feels... and he's been just struggling. This whole family has been. They even had gotten a patient care case manager that didn't really help them so much as take their money and not make sure the services were covered by insurance.   What do people do in times like this? How can an agency that is supposed to be so highly esteemed just turn their backs on people in need? I don't understand this. Hospice is either different than I've experienced it in other states or it has changed a lot in this state in the last decade. I know, for example, that there was that lawsuit against medicare to get PD patients covered physical therapy during hospice because PD is degenerative and there are complications with many medications. That was in 2012. They won. But I don't see anyone here that cares. Or wants to help. And we are in the hub of technological advancement, here.   Where do people go for help? What can we do? I'm seeing this overstressed system and trying to give people the benefit of the doubt they are trying their best... but how do people find end of life care for those with parkinson's who understand parkinson's?

Mine came on sudden onset over 30 minutes and effected the whole left side of my body which is almost unheard of. I had no pain until recently because now I get more spastic dystonic tremors from the Sinemet I take. Beta blockers don't usually work for PD tremor but occasionally do. I think of dystonic tremors as the most common to be painful but dystonia is often an early sign of YOPD also. I had a lot of weakness in my tremor hand because I had functional paresis (which can be part of dystonia) meaning my fingers were partially paralyzed because my brain dropped part of it's connection. I've brought about 75% of my finger function back. &#x200B; I would say if you have no other signs consider dystonia on your list. It is often missed as a diagnosis. 	1	1	lenamegan|re|:|Question|about|Early|Onset|Symptoms	YOPD|can|be|very|different|person|to|person|.|Mine|came|on|sudden|onset|over|30|minutes|and|effected|the|whole|left|side|of|my|body|which|is|almost|unheard|of|.|I|had|no|pain|until|recently|because|now|I|get|more|spastic|dystonic|tremors|from|the|Sinemet|I|take|.|Beta|blockers|don't|usually|work|for|PD|tremor|but|occasionally|do|.|I|think|of|dystonic|tremors|as|the|most|common|to|be|painful|but|dystonia|is|often|an|early|sign|of|YOPD|also|.|I|had|a|lot|of|weakness|in|my|tremor|hand|because|I|had|functional|paresis|(|which|can|be|part|of|dystonia|)|meaning|my|fingers|were|partially|paralyzed|because|my|brain|dropped|part|of|it's|connection|.|I've|brought|about|75|%|of|my|finger|function|back|.|​|I|would|say|if|you|have|no|other|signs|consider|dystonia|on|your|list|.|It|is|often|missed|as|a|diagnosis|.

The first symptoms I noticed as being off was I was having more problems with fine motor skills and my hands tired quickly when typing. The tremours started up shortly afterwards. Initially thought I'd double-dosed on my thyroid medication, but they didn't go away. After a bunch of tests to rule out other things and referrals I got to see a movement disorder specialist who was able to diagnose me. Went through a weird mixture of depression (I'm young-onset) and a sort of weird relief that there was a reason I'm so damn clumsy. I'm doing better, and thankfully I'm still at the stage where the worst of the symptoms are controlled by levodopa. PD isn't a death sentence.

Also, I'm a power lifter and had trouble training because both arms were not moving simultaneously. I went to neurologist who is an MDS. First set of tests like handwriting was very tiny, walking was unbalanced. Everything she tested said PD. So next up the DAT scan and sure enough it confirmed initial diagnosis Stage 2PD.

"I posted a video by Dr Micheal Okun last week. One of the key take always is the best thing to do before anything else is Exercise. That is before medication, or anything else. There are a lot of people who have lived with Parkinson's for over 40 years. One guy I meet was diagnosed at age 52, probably had it for 10 year before that as his wife said it took a while to convince him to be seen by a Doctor. What was remarkable was he was 90 years old when I meet him. Still active on a family farm. I would have thought he was maybe 70, but key was that he remained active. For me I went years before starting medication, and I responded fantastic to medication. Seems ironic had it not been for my wake up call to start exercising and loosing weight I would have probably succumbed to diabetes. I was over 300 pounds, am down to 240 pounds. Still need to loose weight, but getting there. At 6'3"" I spent too many years at a desk and on the road for business. Took a toll on me. Exercise, eat sensibly, and (try to) get a good nights sleep.

I think typically for PD, the most common early symptoms are tremor, digestive and olfactory (smelling) issues. Also sleep disturbances are very common years before onset.

ParkieDude re: Having strange conversations with loved one with parkinson's that seem partial true?	With Parkinsons/Lewy Body you remember people around you and things. It's odd how my memory seems so clear at times, yet the present day doesn't seem real. When you first wake up you're still in a fog of a dream how you got back to the present. Is she being seen by a MDS? Schizophrenic symptoms are usually too much Parkinson's medications. As Parkinson's progresses is always a trade off between movement or cognitive issues. I tried clorazepam, while I slept, the next day I was in the fog. I found myself in a dream building a tiny home with my Dad. Peaceful place we were having fun, just enjoying build a nice place in a nice location. I woke up and was in tears as I soon realized it was a dream state, as he passed twenty years ago but it felt like he had just died. Couldn't explain that one to my wife who just tells me to get over it.

A DATScan cannot specifically diagnose PD or any other condition. Will it really give you peace of mind? Either way you still have some kind of symptoms and need a diagnosis, which the study cannot give you. It can usually tell you that there is some kind of problem with the midbrain presynaptic dopamine circuitry (or not) but that obviously leaves open a number of possibilities. It is really only occasionally useful, as when evaluating mixed tremor syndromes or trying to tease apart medication-induced from idiopathic or psychogenic syndromes. In general, I would not recommend obtaining such a study prior to an in-person evaluation by a neurologist, preferably one who is a movement disorders specialist. 	1	1	mudfud|27|re|:|Waiting|for|MDS|appt	Really|depends|on|what|exactly|you|are|hoping|to|learn|.|A|DATScan|cannot|specifically|diagnose|PD|or|any|other|condition|.|Will|it|really|give|you|peace|of|mind|?|Either|way|you|still|have|some|kind|of|symptoms|and|need|a|diagnosis|,|which|the|study|cannot|give|you|.|It|can|usually|tell|you|that|there|is|some|kind|of|problem|with|the|midbrain|presynaptic|dopamine|circuitry|(|or|not|)|but|that|obviously|leaves|open|a|number|of|possibilities|.|It|is|really|only|occasionally|useful|,|as|when|evaluating|mixed|tremor|syndromes|or|trying|to|tease|apart|medication-induced|from|idiopathic|or|psychogenic|syndromes|.|In|general|,|I|would|not|recommend|obtaining|such|a|study|prior|to|an|in-person|evaluation|by|a|neurologist|,|preferably|one|who|is|a|movement|disorders|specialist|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705171547064370441/agumonkey-re:-Rock-steady-boxing	agumonkey re: Rock steady boxing	That's great. As a musician, having a metronome has always been a very special tool for my brain. And even for my whole body. It help aligning all the rhythms inside your mind and also helps your brain making sense of the stimuli. If I may suggest, maybe later as it seems that walking is more of a priority for PD patients. Slow and syncopated percussion might (I say might, I'm no neuroscientist) stimulate your brain in lots of ways. It might be too hard depending on your brain state, but if not, I'd bet a few dollars that it will give you tons of benefits. Syncopation and polyrhythms tap into deep parts of the brain and have very very calming effects. Also helps making more efficient use of your muscles and helps getting precise. The metronome is key because it gives a reference point that helps your mind calibrate. That's it for my pseudo-science suggestion. Best wishes. 	1	1	agumonkey|re|:|Rock|steady|boxing	That's|great|.|As|a|musician|,|having|a|metronome|has|always|been|a|very|special|tool|for|my|brain|.|And|even|for|my|whole|body|.|It|help|aligning|all|the|rhythms|inside|your|mind|and|also|helps|your|brain|making|sense|of|the|stimuli|.|If|I|may|suggest|,|maybe|later|as|it|seems|that|walking|is|more|of|a|priority|for|PD|patients|.|Slow|and|syncopated|percussion|might|(|I|say|might|,|I'm|no|neuroscientist|)|stimulate|your|brain|in|lots|of|ways|.|It|might|be|too|hard|depending|on|your|brain|state|,|but|if|not|,|I'd|bet|a|few|dollars|that|it|will|give|you|tons|of|benefits|.|Syncopation|and|polyrhythms|tap|into|deep|parts|of|the|brain|and|have|very|very|calming|effects|.|Also|helps|making|more|efficient|use|of|your|muscles|and|helps|getting|precise|.|The|metronome|is|key|because|it|gives|a|reference|point|that|helps|your|mind|calibrate|.|That's|it|for|my|pseudo-science|suggestion|.|Best|wishes|.

Handyman dad and he was so frustrated by his inability to help, build, fix... He built houses, he could maintain anything in the house, and was a huge personality in the local community. I lost him late last year. Dad remained really positive for the most part and tried new drugs and new routines to enable better quality of life for as long as he could. He called it Parky. He had it for around 15 years. I won't lie to you; it is so, so hard to watch them go downhill with this terrible, unfair disease. Cancer was what technically took my dad, but the Parkinsons was very advanced and robbed him of his ability to do anything for himself in the end. It was especially hard on my mother in the last couple of years. We put him in fulltime care. But y'know, people are researching, new drugs are being trialled all the time, and I have hope that people with Parkinsons will be able to live much longer, better quality lives in the very near future.

Peanuts are legumes (that always confuses me!). I am not much of a meat eater, I'd rather have a small portion of mixed nuts over a steak any day of the week. Hence lunch is an apple with peanut butter and a banana. This on reason I am looking at smoothie recipes to get fresh fruit. Trick with a smoothie is chop ""just enough, but not too much"". If you blended too fine the body doesn't get the fiber benefits but it can extract the sugars. A dietitian friend was trying to explain the details about fiber/sugar trade off.

Doc thought I had PD at age 25, but dismissed it was I was too young! I was probably at my lowest point at age 55, just couldn't walk too far (200 feet to the mail box was exhausting, and I would fall). Started working out. I was seen by a MDS who was polite, but pretty much was ""you should have been on meds years ago"". I screwed up not wanting that diagnosis so was in denial for years. Rock Steady Boxing three years improved confidence and strength. My Golden Retriever helped with walking. If I fell, people stopped to see if dog needed help! Recently learned to run! 60 Years old and I finally learned to run. I even amaze myself. There is a woman, who was diagnosed at age 50 and took up running Marathons. Seventeen years later she has done a marathon every year and shows no decline at age 67. She is my role model! So that first year of ""official diagnosis"" was my lowest point.

That must have been a shocking onset. May I ask if you find that symptoms come and go or perhaps came and went? I ask because of the three symptoms I've noticed fitting PD-like presentations (sleep issues (specifically jerking awake), tremors and bladder urgency) my sleeping issues have entirely vanished. It was such that I could not even nap and since December I am back to normal. The bladder urgency also (seems to be) controlled by medication that isn't related to standard PD treatment. The tremors which... are there? Overall seem to be improving in intensity in the order of their appearance. So looking at the appearance and subsequent disappearance of these symptoms, does that seem to fit a Parkinson's-like flow of progression? That is to say, if I had sleeping issues, should I have expected to see them vanish as they did? Should I have experienced a coming and going of them? Or, should have expected a slow but steady increase in intensity over time?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4698388588286187211/YOPD--Narrative-with-question-re:-Speed-of-onset-symptoms	YOPD- Narrative with question re: Speed of onset symptoms	Hello. First of all, thank you for taking time to read this. I realize you are probably not a MD. I have seen MDs for the below described issues and would like to ask \*non\*-medical professionals with real-world experience. 35m here. tldr is below but a full read may help in offering the best insight. In August 2018 I had my tonsils removed. One month after this my soft palate descended in my mouth which gave me sleep-onset hypnic jerks. It was a terrible experience. My doctor prescribed .5mg Etizolam three times daily (I live in Japan where it is legal) to help me get sleep. I wanted to be careful with the benzo-derivative so I only took one pill daily 30 min before going to bed. Etizolam helped a great deal and although I was careful with it, it was not mentally taxing or worrisome for me. Mid-November I noticed a tremor in my right pinky when my hand was held out and also a tremor in my left ring and pinky finger. I tapered the Etizolam and the tremor persisted and spread through my body (lips, tongue, toes). As I was undergoing anxiety I am willing to attribute those tremors to simply that, stress/anxiety. I visited a neurologist who gave me an MRI immediately. No visible problems were evident. He asked me to wait two weeks and see. I waited two weeks and saw him again at which point the tremors had left my body but remained in my hands (although to a lesser degree) while also extending to my wrists and elbows. He said since the other tremors had gone I should wait and see if this was simply a withdrawal of Etizolam and he asked to see me in March 2019. This was mid-December. On December 21st I began to have UTI-like symptoms. They were simple at first, a sensation of needing to visit the restroom ever-so-slightly more than usual. I saw a urologist that day and he said my urinalysis was clean. Dec. 23rd the slight urge persisted so I saw another GP, same result. Dec 26th visiting family in the States I was now having serious urges to void as soon as 10 minutes after voiding so I saw a urologist. Dx'd prostatitis and gave me a week of antibiotics. I felt better for a day then proceeded to get much, much worse. Dec 29th on what was supposed to be a surprise family trip to Disney World I had to be taken off the plane in Orlando and taken to a hospital I was in such pain and voiding so frequently. They CT'd and found no severe problems. Possible cystitis and suggested I get a cystoscopy. Dec 30th I woke up feeling okay but by 10AM I was attached by the hip to a toilet and experiencing pain in my urethra. That night I experienced mind-numbing frequency, urgency and pain. I could not think about anything other than voiding for hours on hours. Dec 31st, after a voiding around 10AM the symptoms slowly vanished. I'll leave out details of how I thought I was fine and came down with norovirus two days later putting a cap on the nightmare 'vacation'. During this time my tremors in my fingers (mostly dominant right hand) seemed to settle as did tremors in my right wrist. There were now periods of the days where I could hold out my hand and pivot my wrists up and down without noticing a tremor throughout my hand. Slight tremors in my arms (from elbow to fingertips) persisted when I held my arms above my head or rest my elbows on a table and grasp my hands in front of me. January 11th, I noticed increasing trips to the bathroom. January 12th. From 2am - 9am I voided 9 times. Went back to local urologist in Japan, did an ultrasound and despite everything looking 'the right size' he said could indeed be prostatitis and gave me the Japanese equivalent of Cialis. Symptoms began to taper that evening and through the next day. January 14th I felt completely like my old self. From around January 14th I was also able to hold my fingers straight and sometimes if I hold my fingers out but don't concentrate or try to force them straight, they easily stay straight. Just the same I visited a specialist for Interstitial Cystitis and he scheduled me for a cystoscopy. January 17th the urgency came back the morning of the cystoscopy. The cystoscopy looked great I have a healthy-looking bladder.     tldr: Late November: Slight tremors in fingers and body. Eventually settling in fingers, wrists and arms at elbows. December: Reduction in tremor throughout body but remaining in fingers, hands, arms. Increasing urgency over ten-day period resulting in, ultimately, severe pain/burning and \*\*\*constant\*\*\* urge to void that vanished over 12hr window. January: Return of urinary urge symptoms but the length of symptoms is greatly reduced while on Cialis equivalent (possible reaction to diet that is kind to bladder) Periods of reduced tremor activity in fingers throughout the day are observed. Improvement in wrist tremor (even during high stress periods) Arm/elbow tremors persist. I have been through a plethora of Dr. Google searches, and more doctor visits than are listed even in the detailed explanation and two potential answers that keep popping up are PD or MSA which my doctors are dismissing (understandably but simultaneously frustratingly so). Yet reading so many personal accounts online seem to keep pointing me back in that direction. Does the speed of these symptoms seem to match with PD onset? I realize everyone is a unique case but is a barely three-month window just too unlikely for the speed at which something like PD would act on multiple systems in a patient? I appreciate your time and consideration in replying.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4698270624314634590/Seriously-considering-FMT-at-private-clinic	Seriously considering FMT at private clinic	Recently diagnosed and have been reading around the subject. The theory of PD starting in the gut due to some environmental event such as pesticides or repeated antibiotics causing microbiome imbalance seems plausible given the reasearch on how cutting the vagus nerve gives a strong protection statistically against PD. Also the research that PD patients have an unbalanced microbiome is very interesting. I have now ordered a stool test to see if my micobiome matches the population distribution found in the research papers for PD. If it does, I am seriously considering FMT at a private clinic. Note I have no gut issues at all such as constipation. Thought on this please. Has anyone else done such an analysis, or tried FMT ? 	1	1	Seriously|considering|FMT|at|private|clinic	Recently|diagnosed|and|have|been|reading|around|the|subject|.|The|theory|of|PD|starting|in|the|gut|due|to|some|environmental|event|such|as|pesticides|or|repeated|antibiotics|causing|microbiome|imbalance|seems|plausible|given|the|reasearch|on|how|cutting|the|vagus|nerve|gives|a|strong|protection|statistically|against|PD|.|Also|the|research|that|PD|patients|have|an|unbalanced|microbiome|is|very|interesting|.|I|have|now|ordered|a|stool|test|to|see|if|my|micobiome|matches|the|population|distribution|found|in|the|research|papers|for|PD|.|If|it|does|,|I|am|seriously|considering|FMT|at|a|private|clinic|.|Note|I|have|no|gut|issues|at|all|such|as|constipation|.|Thought|on|this|please|.|Has|anyone|else|done|such|an|analysis|,|or|tried|FMT|?

I think you will never regret taking the time to be with your father especially if you are able to help put a plan in place, prolonged distance from your partner will be a test of the strength of that relationship. This difficult juncture of family needs hits pretty much everyone at some point in their lives and for those of us that have moved away from home towns and family it is a significant challenge to manage. No matter the issue, emotions will be battered. Given that you are in Europe, (possibly in an EU country?) be sure you know what your right to return is and what your ability to work will be and what your obligation to your employer is with respect to giving notice if you do decide to return for the summer. My personal experience has been recently having to leave the UK to be closer to PD mom while in the midst of my application for UK citizenship after 6 years residency on an EA spousal visa. Watching UK parliamentary debates while I type, I’m uncertain about mt own future but certain that my mom takes comfort in knowing I am closer and able to assist her as she goes through the devastating challenges and uncertainty that PD have cast upon her.

At the same time, I noticed my left hand was not working as well, esp when it comes to typing. When I met with my neuro four months later, he gave me a PD diagnosis. He said something along the lines of knowing or showing symptoms for a while. I thought he was crazy because in my mind, this was sudden onset. The only thing I can think of is depression/apathy and getting constipated easy-ish. (I always thought it was related to my cycle though).

Personal question, do you find yourself having to pee more often? I'd agree, go to your regular doctor and talk it over. Then have them refer you to a neurologist. If you are in the US, DO NOT, let them tell you they won't make the referral. While yes, you should trust your doctors, you can ask for a specialist. If they refuse to offer a referral, find a new doctor. They will try to convince you that you are too young and that shouldn't be a worry. That it's not possible to have it at this age. Insist. Seems to me like you've got enough knowledge to talk knowledgeably about the disease. My doctors looked at me like I was crazy. Amazement, befuddlement, and confusion, happened when I had detailed information and references to medical journals for what I was experiencing. You got this.

From what I understand (my dad has Parkinson’s) the hereditary possibility of developing it down the line isn’t huge; it’s actually smaller than people commonly think.

"I lived with Parkinson's for years, but remained in denial about it until it was the point I really needed help (medication). We are the same age. I've worked out with peers for the past five years and seen progression at different rates. The best thing we can do is remain physically and mentally active. Google ""Parkinson's boxing your city"" to see if there are any exercise programs. My boxing class is fantastic as we have a diverse group, but all of us tend to be class A personalities and the class is all those with Parkinson's and their ""corner man"" Four levels of class so you are in a peer group with lots of encouragement to keep working at it. I've had years of depression, but the exercise really helps my mood and to keep active. If I just went to a gym to workout, I'd lose motivation, but have since gotten to known my friends in class so it is a blast to join them for a workout. My movement is much better and I'm in much better shape than I was in five years ago. I tend to be a bit Polly Ana, but my cognitive skills have declined.

Get your father a neurologist that can periodically check up on him and track the progression of his PD. The neurologist will also prescribe some medication for him to take, which should help subdue the symptoms and hopefully slow down the progression to some degree. Also, have your father start a regular exercise routine. This is very important, as it will help keep him mobile and thinking clearly. Perhaps start light but eventually build up. I believe there are also groups for people with PD that help set up an exercise schedule with a trainer. One example I hear often are boxing classes specifically for people with PD. Finally, although you may worry about your father and want to take care of him, allow him a degree of independence. Of course, keep an eye on him and help set up neurology appointments, keep track of his medicine and refill the prescription when necessary, watch his diet and be there when needed but do not treat him as though he is helpless. Allow him to go on with his daily routine until aid becomes necessary or if he asks for a hand. From one person taking care of their to father to another, it can be emotionally difficult at times but this is the moment when he needs you and his loved ones the most. Try to read up on Parkinson's and learn more about this disease in general. Though your father may be in a dark place due to the recent diagnosis, you and the family being there will certainly help him get past it and continue forward with his life. You can do it. I'm sincerely wishing you and your family the best. 	1	1	NuminousPanda|re|:|How|to|help|someone|with|Parkinsons|diagnosis|?

My movement disorder specialist prescribed the dopamine agonist ropinirole (generic Requip). I've been titrating up over the course of four weeks and I am now taking 1mg three times daily. As soon as I increased to this dose I started having visual disturbance side effects. They come in the form of what I guess I'd best describe as flashing lights. I see them briefly when first opening my eyes after being deep asleep. They only last a few seconds. This never happens after I'm fully awake for the day. I tried generic Mirapex previously and discontinued due to the same side effect. As soon as I discontinued the Mirapex the visual disturbances upon wakening stopped. They started up again only after titrating up to 1mg 3x daily of ropinirole. They did not occur at the lower doses. I had a thorough eye exam and my eyes checked out fine. My ophthalmologist wasn't surprised this was happening and said it was associated with taking DAs and was not dangerous. My movement disorder specialist said she's never heard of anyone having this side effect.

It didn't stop the tremors or anything like that, but with the cocktail of meds he is on it was pain relief where he didn't have to worry about a bad interaction. My dad really can't handle weed though. He ate one edible that was a little too intense and he swore them off. I got him to smoke weed for the 1st time in 20 years, about 15 years ago, and he had to quit then too. If your grandpa isn't used to weed, I'd try edibles at 10 mg and break them in half. I've heard CBD is amazing but my dad refuses to try it. Stubborn. 	1	1	thebarwench|re|:|Does|anyone|have|experience|taking|CBD|or|THC|(|Cannabis|)|products|for|their|Parkinsons|?

Does anyone have experience taking CBD or THC (Cannabis) products for their Parkinsons?	My grandfather has parkinsons and is not very active as he is over 80 years old. He can't do the usual things like tend to his chickens and collect eggs like he used to. I think he's past ever returning to that point, but that's besides the point. My grandparents have both received medical prescriptions for their ailments, and as a fairly education cannabis user myself, I believe the stuff they're getting is utter crap and doesn't really help them. My grandma in particular claims she's taking 6mg of CBD 3 times a day, as she wants to sustain the CBD in her body so it helps with her stuff. Point is, I think the stuff they're both taking is crap and is too weak or too-purified to actually do them any good. I'm starting to think they need more full-spectrum products, products that have more of the CBD compounds, and the terpenes if possible. From personal experience using for Migraines and pain, I know for a fact that CBD alone can do very little for most things, especially at the amount they're taking it in. My Grandma claimed that the THC made her dizzy, which I find interesting because she took such a small amount, and it was through an oil vs any other method which would've been more obvious. I'm just thinking there must be a good product out there specific to them. They're also not too keen on trying new things. Now that it's legal where I am, there are options like sprays that have 15% CBD by vol. and <1% THC by vol. and she doesn't even want to try that, though I'm certain that it'll do her and my grandpa much better than just CBD alone, since THC also works upon similar receptors in the brain and having the full spectrum or more of the compounds in the plant present should have a much different effect than the crap their taking right now.

I'm 42 (F) and was diagnosed a little over 2 years ago. Most of what I post here is about this disease in one way or another, feel free to get nosey. I struggle with emotional and physical ups and downs. I'm on 4 hours of sleep since last night, not all in a row. My best advice is to make your life as easy as possible. Seems obvious, I know. 1. Take help from people that offer. Little things turn impossible some days. Help with meals, driving to appointments, and chores frees up the little energy I have to do other things. 2. Get your meds in order, keep spares with you, and always take them on time. I once was hospitalized for a non-PD issue, and had great difficulty getting my meds, which compounded the problem. Now I have them on me, always. 3. Get into strenuous exercise, and keep at it. The idea is ""forced intensity"", working out harder than normal. Puddles of sweat! There are lots of Parkinson's disease exercise groups, which I recommend because of our commonality. Tremors are accepted, we talk shop, etc. I am a huge fan of Rock Steady Boxing, but am looking into also training for a Spartan race in the coming year. 4. Support group and / or emotional counciling. You've just been given some traumatic news, and are dealing with all sorts of emotions. No shame in getting mentally prepared for your new life.

And, the younger you are at diagnosis, the greater the chance of it being a genetic type. I was diagnosed at 27. My movement disorder specialist was very perplexed over me having no family history of PD. One thing to note about the genetic causes: it’s rarely, you have gene X and therefore you have disorder X. The main genetic mutations LRRK2, and GBA only leading to “an increased chance” of PD. If you have no symptoms, then I would not worry. It’s a whole “don’t borrow trouble until trouble borrows you.” Exercise and be healthy because that’s just generally good advice. edit - Another thing to add. You may be tempted to go through some kind of genetic testing. As my wife found out: this rarely helps due to the nature of genetic testing. You want a yes or no answer.

As most mentioned, idiopathic (no known cause) is the majority of the cases of Parkinson's. Essential Tremor is 10x more common, so possible his Mum had tremors but passed from other causes, so never noted as Parkinson's. Odd trivia, my family is also very well spaced out (Dad's older than most) as my Great Grandfathers all fought in US civil war. My Grandmother was 23 during the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake and Fire and had amazing stories. What was your Dad's occupation? There are some known exposure factors regarding Parkinson's, but given his symptoms stated when he was 40 and would have been around 1980s just wondering. I have over sixty first cousin's, yes very large family, but none of my cousins have Parkinson's. At age 20 my best advice is to keep active, physically and mentally. Eat sensible, avoid added sugar, and get a good nights sleep. If you do those and keep a healthy BMI I suspect you'll be fine. Only other thing I can think of is wear your hazmat gear! Chemical exposure is something I never thought twice about in my 20's, but we did all sort of things like PCB (electronics) manufacturing that required vats of trichloroethylene in the process.

He just started to go to the doctor yearly about 5 years ago, when he was about 55. He takes his BP meds and statins religiously, after a scare with systolic BP around 200-220 for a bit. I work in as a nurse in neuro rehab, and have noted that he has had some tremors for close to 10 years. Over the last 5 years, he has increasingly dramatic thrashing with dreams at night. Most recently, I note that he holds his arms at his side wile walking. I a terrified, and have no idea of how to bring this up to him without scaring him. He's not at the point where I think he neds meds yet, as I know delaying that is better. Any thoughts on how to gently suggest that he see a PD neurologist? I know who he needs to see via our insurance, but he will FREAK out. Things are too subtle for his PCP to see in a 20 minute visit once every couple of years. Perhaps this belongs better in /r/relationships, but I'd like some feedback.

"Not at all likely to be Parkinsons disease ... really OP you really don't sound like the symptoms you are experiencing are as a result of PD. I can recommend to you that seeing an experienced neurologist is a very good idea. The next best good idea is to insist on being given a referal to a neurologist who is a ""clinical movement specialist."" Yes this exact doctor does exist somewhere near you. But good to see neurologist and then maybe get this second opinion. No one on reddit should attempt to guess what is going to ultimately be determined to be the correct Dx of your tremors etc. It is certainly possible that some rather easily treatable cause might be causing most of your distress so honestly there is great hope in your particular case.

Whoa. My dad claimed to have tried every drug at least once, but he was an alcoholic and would do cocaine on vacation. I didn't find out about that until I was an adult. My uncle smoked pot and as a child my dad and his friends would tell me, ""He will shoot, smoke, snort, and pop anything to get high."" My uncle OD'd, survived, and while in the hospital was picked up for an outstanding warrant. My dad said cleaning out a closet my uncle used he found syringes with needles in my uncle's coat closet. He was freaked out about getting accidentally stabbed/poked. I remember being in kindergarten or first grade and asking my uncle what his favorite flower was. He told me a poppy. I had that memory learning about the opium trade and heroin and got pissed off retroactively. He had actually gotten clean after prison and moved in with a family friend who was like another uncle. That guy got a DUI and skipped state to live with my dad in Kentucky and had a fall and TBI. He was living in a low income kind of rental place and disappeared. After his fall he lost a stutter he had had all of his life. I worry about him, too, and those guys were way better, ""Don't do drugs,"" examples than anything else. I feel like them using CBD oil and my THC tincture and kind of get triggered thinking, ""Drugs are bad, I don't need this, I'm fine."" The depression gets worse, the tremor is more pronounced, the hallucinations come back, I fall over even more (on it I fall over 1-2 a week), and the suicidal thoughts are worse. I went to counselors and a psychiatrist. They diagnosed me with intrusive thought OCD and told me to take extra vitamins. I have done ancestry.com and 23andme and took my dna raw data and put it into a third party program called promethease. I have some genetic markers for Parkinsons and OCD (and endo and schizophrenia), but my family says I'm fine and I am being a hypocondriac. I know most 32 year olds don't feel this way and I don't want to feel this way. So I need to get checked out. I worry about ALS and Lewy Body Dementia.

We all know that PD can be a difficult disease to diagnosis, given all the different symptoms and how it shows up differently in people. Does anyone know if there is like a database of symptoms and subsequent progression? I think it would be kind of interesting, esp for us YOPD'ers, and helpful for planning and self-care. Me, I'm 47f. My symptoms started this spring quite suddenly. I got officially diagnosed in late summer. My tremors are pretty mild but I'm noticing I have to be a bit more deliberate when I walk and my sleep is totally fucked. The latter could be a result of a very, very, very stressful workplace. My biggest concerns are how I will support myself and what how my disease will progress. Thanks! 	1	1	Database|of|symptoms|and|progression|timeline|?

Three kids, full time teaching, and you'll be exhausted. Insomnia, forgetting things and getting words mixed all go hand in hand. My wife has endometriosis and full hysterectomy. Both have taken a toll on her. Her Dad is Marine diagnosed with Parkinson's, but she doesn't seem to have it but a host of other medical issues. There are a ton of environmental triggers out there, something like Paraquat is still widely used in USA and known trigger. For me, I was first noted by a Doc who suspected Parkinson's when I was 25. San Jose 1983, but dismissed as I was too young to have ""an old person's disease"". My Doctor gave me to best advice possible, as I was an avid cyclist, to keep on riding. Tremor, rigidity, slow movement all noted at the time, but I could get on a bicycle and ride! Today all would be recognized as Parkinson's, but Doc just thought I was too young for that. Later, when reading about the Frozen Addicts, makes sense as he had a bunch of drug use questions, but I was an Engineer who liked Beer, nothing else. I have my suspicions the synthetic painkillers (They thought would be safer than opioids) were used in Military Hospitals in the 1960s. Processed incorrectly the had other compounds, hence the ""Frozen addict"" is interesting reading. In your case: Talk to your PCP (Primary Care Physician) to get a referral to an MDS (Movement Disorder Specialist) For your MDS Appointment: What do you hope to resolve? i.e. address tremor so I can make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for the kids (that was a challenge for me!) as I made my kids ham and cheese sandwiches, but couldn't spread anything as I needed both hands. &#x200B; List You Symptoms: i.e. go to bed at 10 PM, but wake at 1 AM and can not get back to sleep Can not hold a glass of water with your left hand, but the right hand is fine. Depression? Apathy? so on. &#x200B; What your current medical conditions are, past surgeries. &#x200B; Family Medical History? Father and Uncle Had Parkinson's. Cancer? Etc. &#x200B; My MDS is a working mom with four young kids. Every woman in my Parkinson's Boxing class has always gotten the ""it's just early menopause, you need HRT, you need.... "" The stories are very similar until they found the right MDS! Often my MDS comments she had exhausted Mom's come in but it wasn't Parkinsons, a few with Essential Tremor. Still for friends that I go to boxing with, the horrible road with ""started with a small tremor"". One was a marathon runner and was told it was impossible for anyone with Parkinson's to be able to run! In her case, one leg would drag and she couldn't run in a straight line. Yep, Parkinson's. Ten years later she is still running Marathons. &#x200B; Oh, crud, too much coffee and a wall of text. Sorry about that. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B;.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4686031085187403093/Early-Onset-Parkinson's-32-F	Early Onset Parkinson's [32 F]	"Hi r/Parkinsons. Update: I had my DAT scan last Thursday. The results came.back as ""mildly abnormal"" and I've been referred to a neurologist. Does anyone have any experience with those kind of results? I'm relieved it showed something, but at the same time worried about what happens next. I'm a 32 year old woman and have been having depression, insomnia, pain, tremors, forgetting words, misspeaking, hallucinations, and rigidity. I've been falling over more and feeling horribly exhausted. I have 3 kids and work full time teaching middle school. I had abdominal pain and bowel issues at 19, finally was diagnosed with endometriosis at 23 and had a full hystorectomy at 29. I thought my pain would be more manageable but it is getting worse. November 2017 I decided to take a leave of absence from teaching for the spring and summer. I found a less stressful school and am still struggling to do simple things. I lost and got health insurance so I have a doctor's appt in January. My father passed away in March 2018 and we went to his memorial put of state. Cleaning up his house I found his military paper work and my uncle's. My uncle and dad were exposed to Agent Orange while in Vietnam. My uncle's medical records stated he had Parkinson's. No one had ever mentioned it. His kids and I remembering him shaking and were told by other adults that's what happens when you do heavy drugs and go through withdrawal and get clean. He died at 47 and I don't know if it was substance abuse like the family says or Parkinsons. I'm just feeling bad tonight. Sore. I have to wait for my appointment to get a neurological referral and my family/husband think I'm worrying for nothing and I am fine. I don't have a diagnosis, but I do not know what else could be wrong with me. It seems so far away to have to wait.

Any way I am going to warn you any one who reads this post about the perils of paralysis in end stage PD. Be warned that in most cases where paralysis in a man or woman who has as patient lives long life very alive and fighting terrible PD at the end of life many victims need special family care and concern if they should bc paralysed . paralysis in a sufferer who has been active all his/ her life can be devestating to survive but your loved one can survive paralysis with your care and help ! I am sure not every none will ever suffer paralysis but as PD patients live long fruitful lives PD does get worse and symptoms do worsen . just a word to the wise. janet asked me .... ""well how long do you think I have"" remember In another century I used to lecture in neuroanatomy and teach a brain sciences course in nurses college ... but these folk were the hands on care giver I now depend on to care for janet ladies like my long ago students any way janet asks me well how long do i have .... remember janet has already died one maybe once last month so we have been through that adventure alread together (yes she had a dramatic nde and it appears if you want to view the reddit write up about janet her story appers on a page on this thread here: r/Dehydration_desert if you are interested to read her story .... but back to the present case I'm just saying realize paralysis can happen and do not think that is the end of your loved ones life #41 lived more than 2 years in a wheel chair ....family makes all the difference. I dont know how long janet has we take it day by day she was just restared on ativan for pain and anxiety I may authorize more benzos as needed to provide comfort to janet I just say that bc you always want to try make your loved one comfortable. Pain meds are also ok IMO of course but be care ful bc of breathing inpairment issues ..... but your dr will know ....again we want to deminish her pain in janets case .... these new treatments I am sure have come a long way .... important to identify the disease early and prepare to treat and love your loved one! best www resource is michaeljfox and i do not remember if the end is .net or .com maybe .org but michaeljfox has done a great service with the web site all about PD.

"I have not tried it, but my understanding is that cannabis helps with anxiety/pain/etc because it affects the dopamine levels in the brain. The drug tells the brain to increase dopamine production and causes good feelings and relieves the stress. But with parkinsons, the dopamine cells are dead and can't produce what they don't have! So it seems to me that it would possibly overtax the dopamine cells creating more issues or no relief at all. CBD may be different as a topical for helping nerves /muscles near the surface or digestive issues. That's a big problem with cannabis legislation. It seems to be labeled the cure all for every illness, often touted by people who have never experienced or studied the effects of it on specific diseases. More like, ""it calms me down, so it will help someone with parkinsons tremors"". Great science there. What needs to happen is for the national government to take it off schedule 1 drug list so universities and private labs can study the effects without the fear of losing funding of going to jail.

I was at a PD event where I spoke to two patients who said cbd with or without THC did little for their PD symptoms. Now, they both liked the THC aspect but did not notice a PD specific effect.

Let me preface this by saying I am not a doctor, I'm just speaking from personal experience! &#x200B; I use CBD, my father does not. I've offered as I know it can help with his symptoms as well, but he's very old school. I don't use mine for my tremors (they are very minor unless I'm in a lot of pain or stressed) but I use it for muscle rigidity, pain etc. &#x200B; First off, did you buy her CBD from hemp (no THC) or derived from cannabis? The kind from hemp does not have any psychoactive ingredients, so its usually safer, but I personally do not find it as effective, but I do use both. Unfortunately since its been in that grey area of legality for so long, not a lot of medical professionals know much about it, and the ones that do are generally few and far between. Second of all, its ALWAYS safer to start with a smaller dose then work your way up (even just CBD) especially with edibles! Since edibles take longer to get into your system as opposed to smoking/vaping, if you aren't careful it can hit you really hard and make you feel a lot worse. And I mean a LOT worse! Been there myself and now I'm really careful about dosing. &#x200B; Personally my experience has been a lot of trial and error. I do not like edibles as much as I like tinctures or vaping, but it does depend on what your gran feels more comfortable with as well. As I said before, start small and work your way up from there, and always give it time to see if it is effective. Both CBD only and cannabis products CAN help with PD, but it isn't for anyone. It can increase paranoia and hallucinations, both things that can be common with PD.

Stop-spasmtime re: My dad's Parkinsons is getting worse and need an option for an affordable adjustable bed?	"Hi there, I'm not sure if it would work for your dad, but what we did for mine was buy a medical bed with handrails (it is adjustable but he never uses that function as he ""gets stuck"" and he panics) as well as a lift chair. The chair is electric and he can safely lay down as well as be lifted up to get out of the chair. Plus he feels more secure laying down and sitting up as it doesn't ""fold in"" like his bed does. While I know you can get a reduced cost bed through Medicare if you are in the US, there are other sometimes faster options. I know some medical companies rent them out, or you can do what we did and buy them. We bought both the bed and chair second-hand for a bargain, as its not uncommon for people to want to get rid of these things if their household member no longer needs them (if they move into a home, aren't ill anymore, or pass on). For example the chair alone would have been 1600 dollars new, but since someones family moved their grandmother to a home they were selling it for 75 dollars and it was almost in brand new condition. I still cleaned it before dad used it, but it was a very good buy. He's actually sleeping in it now since he was having dystonia and is waiting for his Sinimet to kick in.

Can he move on his own, like sit up and stuff. If yes than it could help otherwise it might be easier to have the type the use in hospitals.

It's ok to call his doctor and leave a phone message about your concerns. Saddest thing I ever saw was a ER patient come in with full blown Parkinsons x years and they wanted to know a diagnosis.

I'm writing for advice since I don't know even really where to start. My dad is 71 and has been a little off for a long time. Growing up I always heard how my dad was such a space cadet. He also likes to drink. However as time goes on he is getting more and more forgetful, and doing other odd things - calling daughter by wrong name, forgetting how to get around in the town he's lived in for 35 years, not responding appropriately in traffic (stopping at green lights, going through red lights as a specific example). His mom died of PD a few years ago. This time last year he was diagnosed as diabetic, which I thought maybe accounted for some of his weird behavior like seeming ""out of it"", and recently he was hospitalized with vertigo. He signed out AMA because he said they weren't doing anything for him and he got tired of being in the hospital. He just returned from visiting my mom (they're divorced but still get along) for Thanksgiving and she just told me all of her concerns that he has developed PD as well. She said that he was staggering and falling over, had a shuffling gait, was stooped over, took really long naps on the couch, and had a hoarse voice. Also he said some things that were questionable, like how he has to change his will again (??). He told my mom that he went to do it before and the lawyer told him that she wouldn't change his will while he was ""in a mental state"". He went out on the boat with my brother and had trouble getting in and out of the boat. I called my dad myself today since I didn't see him over the holiday, and he basically made it sound like nothing was wrong. Now, my dad has a tendency to minimize and deny, deny, deny. My mom and my brother have a tendency to over-exaggerate things as well, but they told me that my dad isn't checking his blood sugar and is just giving himself insulin, he's reusing needles. He was stumbling and had to catch himself from falling multiple times, and he went to my mom's senior gym and fell off the rowing machine. My family is also worried because he has a girlfriend, has had this girlfriend for at least 6 years, and they are concerned that she's helping herself to my dad's money. My brother's big plan is to come up and visit and look at my dad's checkbook to see if he's writing any odd checks. Also, to have an intervention of some type with him about his symptoms. I don't really know how to take things from here. My dad has a lawyer, and what we had to do for my grandmother was get guardianship, but I don't think my dad will cooperate with that. I'm also not positive he's totally incompetent - like i said, my family has a tendency to over-exaggerate things. I tried to gently suggest to him that he should see a neurologist on the phone, if he's falling, but he said he saw the neurologist at the hospital and the neurologist didn't say anything was wrong. I just don't know what to do. I'm a nurse and I can tell my dad is forgetful, which is not anything new, but I haven't seen him in 6 months and I live 2.5 hours away. We have a distant kind of relationship, we don't talk on the phone often or visit. My dad is not great about keeping in touch - in fact, I didn't find out he was in the hospital until after he had already signed out AMA. Personally, he is very stubborn and defensive, and if \*he\* doesn't think anything is wrong, then he won't play ball. He's been like that his whole life. Should I call his primary care doctor and ask for them for a neurology referral? He was seen by a neurologist at the hospital I used to work at, but I can't just call up and ask for his medical records obviously. I also don't think that he would go willingly, even if I scheduled it for him, drove down and took him to the appointment. Wouldn't the doctor have done something if it showed that my dad's decision making capacity was impaired? Should I (or my mom, or my brother) try to talk to his lawyer? They're worried that he is going to make his GF the executor or change his will, and if he's not thinking clearly, possibly make changes to benefit the girlfriend (who has a whole host of her own health problems that I don't even want to get into). Should I ask his local hospital to please let me know when he's admitted? I get so frustrated when I find out he was in the hospital after the fact and I feel like i miss the opportunity to speak with his doctors and case management. I feel like him being in the hospital is a good opportunity to rally the troops but I don't seem to find out about it until way too late. &#x200B; Thanks for listening and any advice. We're not exceptionally close but I don't want something bad to happen to my dad, like for him to fall when he's at home alone or for someone to take advantage of him, or for him to hurt anyone if he does something stupid while he's driving. I'd like to be more available to him but he doesn't reach out to me, even though I'm 33 I'm still treated like the baby of the family.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4680899618020414915/How-to-talk-about-PD?	How to talk about PD?	"Hi everyone, My mom was diagnosed with PD about 5 years ago. She is about to retire, and my dad still works. She is very, very smart and I think the loss of her work is devastating, although she'd never admit it. She goes to voice, physical and normal therapy, does PD yoga, exercises, and drinks Boost to supplement her diet. She can't take antidepressants. Her voice gives out often, her tremors are so bad she can't do basic tasks, and she's lost a huge amount of weight. My mom has always been the rock of the family, and she has always been very independent and forward-thinking. But I think she feels like she's hit a wall, and it's hard for her to find evidence to the contrary when she can't physically do anything. My dad gets frustrated with problems he can't solve. I know they need me around, but I can't leave school yet. I've organized my schedule and saved up so that I can visit more often. I can't ignore the problem, but at the same time I can't diagnose it with any precision. ""Being there"" doesn't seem like it's enough. Calling a family meeting to talk about what she needs seems like it would be almost cruel. Suggesting she take up a hobby would get me laughed out the door, not that anyone's really laughing. I don't have the perspective I need on this, because for most of my life, she's been ""Mom"" rather than a person with struggles and dimension. I should have been paying attention much earlier, and now I'm unprepared. How do I talk to her about what she needs? Apologies for the long post and vague question. Thank you for reading.

"Something that has puzzled me, and PT friends, is if I increase my cadence my heart rate goes down! This doesn't make sense at all, and my son commented if I am at ""zone 5"" on heart rate, It would be impossible to carry on a conversation. &#x200B; Well, seems PD is at play with this. I have a [cadence & pulse graph](https://i.imgur.com/ArFyI18.jpg) of a 5K run I did. 41 minute run, but when I hit the 4K marker I decided to go for it. Body warmed up, felt good, my stride didn't increase I just ""peddled faster"" (moves my legs at a faster pace). It would have been a 11 min/mile which is my fastest. Normally I run an easy 16min/mile (10min/km) pace. Showed I have much more reserve. By increasing my speed, apparently I am letting more blood into muscles, so my pulse went down! EDIT: this was 5 1KM laps around a church parking lot, so same course and elevation for five laps hence why it seemed so odd. &#x200B; tl;dr: Nothing regarding pulse nor bp makes sense, but Parkinson's seems at play!

Spoons are a short of odd symbol, but for some people it works. If not, replace spoons with cash out gas and it may make more sense. Basically it guess like this. You have only so many spoons in a day. And everything you do, costs a spoon. You can only use x spoons per day. Unlike before PD, you are not allowed to borrow spoons from tomorrow. So now the trick is to assign a value to spoons. I'd suggest journaling. Make a daily entry with what you did and fit how long and then the next day record your energy. I'd guess it will only take a week or two to figure out your individual spoon value, and about what each activity costs. Then you can give yourself a budget, with the idea that some times, even though you know it will take you days to recover, you decide to over spoon. But most days, you can plan activities, accept or decline invitations with the idea of your spoon budget. So your spoons might look like this: an hour of daily activities (showering, cooking, housework) is 1 spoon, an hour of something creative is 2 spoons, and an hour workout is 3 spoons, and you only have 5 spoons a day. So on a day when you want to workout (which should be daily), you'll know you either can't plan anything else, because just basic daily activities will take you up to 5 spoons, or you need to workout for a half hour, so you can also get coffee with a friend (or whatever). 	1	1	notthefakehigh|5r|re|:|I|keep|getting|burnt-out|.

My mother has a lower quality of life from pain from the tremors. Her neurologist doctors obviously want to treat the cause of the pain instead of prescribing opioids (we are in Canada). The problem is nothing seems to work but the opioids her family doctor have prescribed take the edge off the pain. She has even tried medical marijuana with no success. She just recently qualified for the DBS so she is hopeful that will help with the pain. I guess my question is to other Parkinsons pain sufferers and how they relate to opioids and if they help and if they have encountered resistance to getting them prescribed for their pain. 	1	1	Question|related|to|opioids|to|treat|the|pain|from|tremors|.

There is a small, but by no means comprehensive body of work suggesting that CBD could be beneficial in PD. CBD is just of many different compounds contained in marijuana, which I think the article does a poor job of explaining. Due to the restrictions on marijuana research, it’s difficult to know what strains of plant contain what compounds, and at what ratios. As for the benefits of medical marijuana in PD, the jury is still out - misguided federal regulations have hindered systematic research on the plant in general, so most of the data that’s out there is fragmented and anecdotal. I think what many proponents of medical marijuana gloss over is that this is still a drug, and can still have pretty bad side effects - this is not a “miracle plant.” If you are going to try it, be very cautious. 	1	0	CaptainKoconut|re|:|Medical|Marijuana|Effects|on|Parkinson's|Disease	An|important|note|is|that|this|article|touts|the|benefits|of|Cannabadiol|(|CBD|)|,|in|PD|.|There|is|a|small|,|but|by|no|means|comprehensive|body|of|work|suggesting|that|CBD|could|be|beneficial|in|PD|.|CBD|is|just|of|many|different|compounds|contained|in|marijuana|,|which|I|think|the|article|does|a|poor|job|of|explaining|.|Due|to|the|restrictions|on|marijuana|research|,|it|’|s|difficult|to|know|what|strains|of|plant|contain|what|compounds|,|and|at|what|ratios|.|As|for|the|benefits|of|medical|marijuana|in|PD|,|the|jury|is|still|out|-|misguided|federal|regulations|have|hindered|systematic|research|on|the|plant|in|general|,|so|most|of|the|data|that|’|s|out|there|is|fragmented|and|anecdotal|.|I|think|what|many|proponents|of|medical|marijuana|gloss|over|is|that|this|is|still|a|drug|,|and|can|still|have|pretty|bad|side|effects|-|this|is|not|a|“|miracle|plant|.|”|If|you|are|going|to|try|it|,|be|very|cautious|.

While it has amazing benefits for those who qualify, it is important to know that the docs carefully select patients because DBS doesn't fix anything for the vast majority of people with Parkinson's. It only helps a small subset of patients (myself included). For most people however, it will have no benefit to what is an arduous and invasive neurosurgery, which is why selection is so strict. For example it doesn't help: \- with balance \- with gait \- with freezing \- with any non motor symptoms (hallucinations, voice, depression/anxiety, cognition, memory, bladder control, bowel problems, gastro problems by way of example. DBS is known to make a lot of things worse for people who's symptoms don't respond well to levodopa therapy. So in a way, your doctor is doing you a solid by refusing to do the surgery - it's because he knows it won't have a positive outcome for her. best wishes and good luck to your mum. 	1	1	moist_damp_panties|re|:|my|mother|was|refused|for|deep|stimulation	To|be|honest|I|wouldn't|hold|out|much|hope|.|There|are|any|number|of|reasons|why|she|would|have|been|refused|,|none|of|which|generally|improve|over|time|with|PD|;|in|fact|the|opposite|is|true|.|While|it|has|amazing|benefits|for|those|who|qualify|,|it|is|important|to|know|that|the|docs|carefully|select|patients|because|DBS|doesn't|fix|anything|for|the|vast|majority|of|people|with|Parkinson's|.|It|only|helps|a|small|subset|of|patients|(|myself|included|)|.|For|most|people|however|,|it|will|have|no|benefit|to|what|is|an|arduous|and|invasive|neurosurgery|,|which|is|why|selection|is|so|strict|.|For|example|it|doesn't|help|:|\|-|with|balance|\|-|with|gait|\|-|with|freezing|\|-|with|any|non|motor|symptoms|(|hallucinations|,|voice|,|depression|/|anxiety|,|cognition|,|memory|,|bladder|control|,|bowel|problems|,|gastro|problems|by|way|of|example|.|DBS|is|known|to|make|a|lot|of|things|worse|for|people|who's|symptoms|don't|respond|well|to|levodopa|therapy|.|So|in|a|way|,|your|doctor|is|doing|you|a|solid|by|refusing|to|do|the|surgery|-|it's|because|he|knows|it|won't|have|a|positive|outcome|for|her|.|best|wishes|and|good|luck|to|your|mum|.

I still have my issues, but its better than it was pre diagnosis, where I was literally suffering. Yes, staying active and exercise helps too, but if you really think she has PD you should let her know what you've observed (ie I didn't notice my arm didn't swing in the mornings, but my husband did) and help her find a good neurologist/ movement disorder specialist. 	1	1	Stop-spasmtime|re|:|My|Sister|of|34|Years|of|Old|Seems|to|Have|PD	Hi|there|,|I|was|actually|diagnosed|at|34|,|I'm|also|female|and|my|father|has|it|as|well|.|What|are|her|symptoms|?|I|know|at|the|point|of|diagnosis|I|was|relived|because|I|had|been|diagnosed|with|a|whole|load|of|other|things|(|fibromyalgia|,|cfs|,|etc|)|that|turned|out|to|be|PD|and|I|could|actually|get|treatment|for|.|Don't|dismiss|medicine|.|No|,|there|currently|isn't|a|cure|,|but|let|me|tell|you|I'm|much|better|off|and|my|disease|has|progressed|much|slower|than|it|did|before|I|was|on|the|correct|medications|.|I|still|have|my|issues|,|but|its|better|than|it|was|pre|diagnosis|,|where|I|was|literally|suffering|.|Yes|,|staying|active|and|exercise|helps|too|,|but|if|you|really|think|she|has|PD|you|should|let|her|know|what|you've|observed|(|ie|I|didn't|notice|my|arm|didn't|swing|in|the|mornings|,|but|my|husband|did|)|and|help|her|find|a|good|neurologist|/|movement|disorder|specialist|.

Meds are generally helpful for many of the symptoms although it’s true that they can cause plenty of side effects. Every person is different when it comes to this. More importantly though is that if you sister does have PD at age34 and your dad had PD at age 52, those are fairly early ages to get PD and it raises the chances that there may be an underlying genetic cause that’s leading to this in your family. This not only potentially has implications for family planning but also there are some medications going through clinical trials now that are trying to target specific mutations in PD. Most people won’t have those mutations but if you sister does, she could be eligible for a trial that may slow down the disease. Exercise is always helpful and may slow down the disease on its own. 	1	1	dgc|2119|re|:|My|Sister|of|34|Years|of|Old|Seems|to|Have|PD	If|you|think|your|sister|has|PD|,|I|would|strongly|urge|her|seeing|a|movement|disorders|neurologist|to|get|checked|out|.|Meds|are|generally|helpful|for|many|of|the|symptoms|although|it|’|s|true|that|they|can|cause|plenty|of|side|effects|.|Every|person|is|different|when|it|comes|to|this|.|More|importantly|though|is|that|if|you|sister|does|have|PD|at|age|34|and|your|dad|had|PD|at|age|52|,|those|are|fairly|early|ages|to|get|PD|and|it|raises|the|chances|that|there|may|be|an|underlying|genetic|cause|that|’|s|leading|to|this|in|your|family|.|This|not|only|potentially|has|implications|for|family|planning|but|also|there|are|some|medications|going|through|clinical|trials|now|that|are|trying|to|target|specific|mutations|in|PD|.|Most|people|won|’|t|have|those|mutations|but|if|you|sister|does|,|she|could|be|eligible|for|a|trial|that|may|slow|down|the|disease|.|Exercise|is|always|helpful|and|may|slow|down|the|disease|on|its|own|.

This is the year a huge thing could be happening and I’m excited but also scared out of my mind at the same time. My dad has begun the process of being assessed for the DBS procedure, and I have spent a lot of time looking into it, it seems safe, but I don’t understand some things. I’ve seen a couple articles stating a 99% survival rate, is that accurate? I mean its brain surgery, its not going to be without its risks so 99% seems unrealistic what with the brain being such a vital organ. What exactly could go wrong? My Dad’s PD affects his speech and mobility, I’ve only seen videos where it greatly helps with hand skills, will it help with mobility too? Has anyone actually died from this surgery before? Is there anything else not hugely covered online that could be useful to know? Its coming to that point of the year where bad things happen for me and my family, its why I hate Christmas and to add to that I have for the last year had awful, scary feelings of losing my Dad to something linked to his Parkinson’s, I’m so scared that saying I love him before the procedure could be the last time I do.

Hes doing a lot better but sleeps quite a bit. The med does that to you. He is himself again mentally. What you wanna do when your dad is back in his senses is get him to sign his power of attorney over to your mom or someone else in the family who you can trust blindly.

You’re going through the stages of grief. It’ll take a while to get through this time of your life but you will make it through. There are lots of groups on Facebook just look up Parkinson’s. There are general groups, young onset groups, groups of people with the advanced DBS therapy. Join one and introduce yourself; you will have an instant support group. Exercise is key. If you don’t have a specialized gym around you, there are PD fitness videos online. One website is The Parkinson’s Fitness Project. They offer live and prerecorded fitness sessions with a famous PD physical therapist. Most importantly, since there’s no cure, you will need to learn to live with this. The good news is that you can live a full and happy life even with Parkinson’s.

The Michael J Fox Foundation website is good for this. I also began participating in their studies, too. I find it this helps me work through it. I am fortunate to have a long time girlfriend who has MS. She has struggled with this neurological disease for more than two decades, and offers a unique perspective and a steady hand when I need it. I talk to her. The anger and the fear has popped up in strange ways. I'm not usually an emotional person but find myself more so especially when reacting to emotional stressors in our relationship. There are support groups in my area but I found that making personal relationships with a few people that I know who also have Parkinsons has been more helpful. You're not alone.

You seem to have veered off into the hypothesis that the microbiology can have a profound impact on the functioning of the CNS. The prevailing hypothesis is that the microbiome can affect the development of depression, via promoting systemic or central inflammation.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4668167444032325658/Officially-Diagnosed-with-YOPD	Officially Diagnosed with YOPD	"Hey r/parkinsons I'm a 36yo male who, as of Monday evening, has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. I rarely went to the doctor except for legit sports injuries, those when I knew a muscle was severely strained, sprained, or torn. Other than that, perfect work attendance and always in the gym. In 2015, I went to my GP with complaints of a stiff left-side neck and severe fatigue that knocked me out daily. We monitored it and then followed the progression through the left side of the body, treating each new symptom has their own problem. Example - Stiff neck, trouble swallowing -> ENT, or double vision -> Opthalmology. This lasted 2.5 years, visiting 30+ health professionals, taking 13+ scans and tests, and turning down the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome diagnosis multiple times. Slow progression and being isolated to one side of the body, our list of ""could bes"" was small and we were focused more on MS or MG. When my arm stopped swinging and my foot was dragging in late 2017, I consulted Dr. Google which led me to Parkinson's. No tremor though, but I insisted we look into it. More referrals, waiting, lumbar puncture and mri's to rule out MS and MG, more waiting and then finally getting to the neurologist a year later. Bradykinesia, Postural Instability, and a positive response to levadopa (30min) led to the diagnosis. No tremor and light rigidity. I've been suspicious for a year (and because everything else was ruled out) so I've already adapted my lifestyle to meet the disease and determined to make the most out of life. It's a relief to finally have closure on a 3.5 year journey through uncertainty and an endless ""trial and error"" in the health system. If concerned about your symptoms, don't be afraid to ask your doctor. All the best.

Get him down to your GP now, even if it requires a massive family confrontation. Don't fuck about, he just cannot bluff much longer. It's going to be 6 months till he sees a neurologist maybe less given he's 7 years in. You might get assigned a nurse who specialises in PD, and they can visit you, and they know their stuff. Parkinson's UK can advise on benefits . Tories make this v hard but if you get rejected, an appeal tends to go better. I'm 5 years in, my handwriting is about to be lost. i'm typing left handed, I haven't fallen over yet but I'm wobbly. Mate, your Dad is a hero, he has his pride, but find your fiercest female relative to beat him up with words until he admits he has PD. If he's living away from home, doing 5 hour trains the stress will kill him. Tough love time.

My Dad has Parkinsons, he got diagnosed 6/7 years ago but kept it a secret from the family until last year. I had noticed he was shaking but he is always doing crazy diets so I thought it might be related to that. He didn't tell me until I asked him about it. He is 57 years old, and he works real hard at a desk job (draftsman) and always has done. As a result of this he has always been overweight whilst I have known him. &#x200B; I was wondering if there was anything he can do to help him at this point? I know there is no cure. He has to hold down his right arm now because it's always shaking (he's taught himself to be left-handed over the years since he found out). &#x200B; Is there any particular fitness/Physiotherapy sort of exercises that have helped people? Would being overweight and sedentary make his symptoms worse? Should he think about lessening his work load? He works from 7am until 6pm 5 days a week. He lives in London for work and commutes home to my mother and siblings about a 4/5 hour trip for weekends, and always has done. I know stress makes the symptoms worse and I was wondering if I should think about saving some money so he can stop working sooner. Should I try to see more of him whilst he is still okay? I know the answer is probably yet but I'm just at a bit of a loss at the moment. Is there anything that I can do to help him? Or any advice I can give him? He is one of those guys that wont seek out help on his own. Because I live away from home I don't get to see him that often, I love him so much and just want to do something, anything. I just need some advice about what is to come.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4667038696200805374/Wilhelm_Lavender-re:-Dopa-responsive-Dystonia-+-Parkinsons?	Wilhelm_Lavender re: Dopa responsive Dystonia + Parkinson’s?	I’m really sorry to hear about your condition. My grandpa has advanced stage Parkinson’s and is on l-dopa and carbidopa. I notice that some days he’s more functional than other days and wonder how much of it has to do with his diet and sleep patterns. I’ve read that it’s best to take l-dopa without food because it competes with amino acids for absorption. I also know the l-dopa likely contributes to an earlier onset of movement problems and may not be the best long term solution. I’m not a doctor but have read promising research on ibogaine derivatives such as noribogaine at improving Parkinson’s symptoms by stimulating the new growth of dopamine producing neurons. However in many countries ibogaine is illegal, but there may be clinical trials available. Other things to consider would include: Getting a heavy metal analysis done, as there is a link between metals and many neurodegenerative diseases. Eating a minimally processed, nutrient rich diet Saunas - heat stress may be able to prevent further misfolded / damaged proteins in the brain. Boost autophagy - this process helps the body clear damaged and misfolded proteins from the body. It occurs during fasting, exercise, sleep, and other times. Improve your mitochondrial health. Consider supplementing with things like co-q-10 and ALA.

I am a 21 year old female diagnosed with dopa responsive Dystonia, was diagnosed a year ago and have been taking levodopa medication. However these past few weeks iv had the feeling that I may have early onset Parkinson’s. i seem to have always had small problems with memory and such but lately it’s been worse and paired with general confusion. As well as that iv had problems with the left side of my body. Pain in my limbs more so on the left as well as shaking hands. My lips shake and my head sometimes does this weird nodding/shaking no movement. I also have freezing gait and when I sit I slightly sway from side to side. I also seem to be experience some on/off periods. Some part of the day I could be fine with very good movement and the next minute I could be frozen in place in pain with slow movements. My body gets easily tired from movement. Like clenching my fists I can’t do very well at all. As well as when I need to pick something small up, my hand shakes uncontrollably, making picking the item up embarrassing and impossible. I am also researching what I can do to get disabled parking. However I’m not sure if my condition is eligible for it in Australia. I will be going to my GP to get me referred to a neurologist but id like advice from people that have PD or know someone with it.

The issue is not, whether or not you have PD. the issue is that you are experiencing a range of symptoms that are effecting your quality of life. And so yes you should definitely get them checked out. Came back with thought. The other thing to consider is other factors. I am not a doctor, and only occasionally play one on the internet, but other factors that may be causing problems are, of the top of my head, Mold toxicity Untreated trauma including intergenerational PTSD or abuse Heavy metal toxicity. I am sure there are others. 	1	1	arkofjoy|re|:|Should|I|go|get|checked|to|see|if|I|have|PD|?

Woah, your Dad and my Dad sound tremendously alike. My Dad isn’t interested in taking on board the advice he receives from consultants, he doesn’t try little bits of exercise, he is constantly constipated because of the amount of codeine he takes but he won’t stop taking them, he doesn’t regularly take his meds for PD, he only takes them when he wants to go somewhere - and the only place he ever wants to go is the bookmakers (betting shop) He’s also severely controlling, he tries to dictate everyone’s day for them. If he’s got a doctors app at say 12pm, he will have his jacket and shoes on ready to go about 10am, even though it’s a 10 minute drive. I love him obviously, he’s my dad, I hate the fact he’s got PD and what it’s done to him/what it’s going to do to him, but he’s becoming almost insufferable to deal with, too stubborn, I’m worried he’s going to die soon because he isn’t doing anything to help his situation. My Mum is a mess because of it, she’s constantly trying to help him, he speaks to her and treats her like crap We’ve all tried so hard to open his eyes but as long as he’s got his codeine, smokes and gambling then he’s happy, no thought whatsoever about the damage he’s doing himself. 	1	1	potatosconeman|re|:|How|to|deal|with|a|parent|having|PD|?

My Father was diagnosed with PD 2 years ago but the medication hasn't helped at all and seems to make him worse, the diagnosis was reached using a clinical checklist very quickly and the DAT scans were too blurry to be used. He is taking Sinimet tablets and Resagiline patches at the moment but in the last 2 months his arms and hands have become a real problem and he is saying he is struggling with chewing and swallowing. Everything I have read online suggests the medication should be helping but his symptoms are progressing rapidly. We have an appointment with his consultant this week but I don't know what to ask, has anyone had any similar experiences with such rapid progression and can anyone suggest what I can ask the consultant? Update: Apologies for the delay, my Father's consultant has admitted him for inpatient treatment so they can focus on getting his medication right and help with his mental health. I'm relieved he is finally getting the help he needs and I hope this is the step forward he needs to improve, it's been really hard the last couple of months seeing him decline so rapidly.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4665153273229311425/yanyosuten-re:-How-to-deal-with-a-parent-having-PD?	yanyosuten re: How to deal with a parent having PD?	*I'll try to give you the advice I would have given to myself 6 years ago, knowing what I know now. But it is ultimately anecdotal and personal, so don't feel pressured by what I suggest, since I don't know what your exact situation is.* &nbsp; Try and talk to your dad about it, hard as it may seem now. There's a good chance he is just trying not to think about it as much as possible, I know my dad did. This only works for a limited time though, once a certain threshold is reached it will become much harder to deal with learning about the disease and coping with it in general. So take the time now to talk about it and learn about it, if possible, together. Try to set him on the path of learning about his illness, his (future) medication and limited official treatments. You can do some of the work for him, but it might not always be easy to relay the things you learn to him. Maybe it helps to think of yourself as the coach of a boxer, going into a very tough fight. &nbsp; The most devastating thing about PD that he will have heard from his doctors is that it is an incurable, degenerative disease. That there is no way out, and life is only going to get worse. This is probably the most crushing thing to deal with. So, my advice would be to try and convey a message of (rational) hope; it is not set in stone he is always going to get worse, there is still room for relative improvement, even in small and limited ways. The doctors just cannot offer treatments unless they are 100% clinically tested, and therefore can not offer much hope at this current moment. Don't hold that against them, but also don't let it stop you from trying to find simple ways to improve life, or better yet; set your dad on a path to discover ways he can ease his life while it is still relatively easy to do so. From simple exercises to retain strength to breathing exercises to deal with possible panic attacks, from trying out different diets, to going full blown hippie-dippie bio, anything that is low-risk and potentially high-reward is worth checking out. Even just to keep spirits high. Find other people on forums and youtube and see how they are dealing with their PD, like William Curtis and others experimenting with diet and PD. &nbsp; It's certainly not going to be easy, and it almost certainly get worse, but it is important to not give up hope and provide positive support. He's likely going to feel like he wants to hide more and more from people if he's anything like my own dad, and eventually could get very stressed out just thinking about meeting with people outside his closest family. His thinking might seem slow, or sometimes on hyperdrive when on certain meds. Be patient and don't force anything on him. Give him time to adapt, and try and normalize his new situation. &nbsp; And also, don't forget about your mom. She's going to have to slowly watch her strong guy turn into someone who is growing increasingly more dependent on her. They probably will both seem to suddenly grow much older very quickly unless she finds a way to retain a sense of normalcy and relief. In many ways, she is also dealt a very bad hand that will weigh heavily on her. She will need to find ways to relax and keep her spirits up along this tough road ahead. It is not selfish for her to focus on herself from time to time, she's also probably not getting any younger. &nbsp; Good luck, and don't give up, even if it seems nothing can be done. Through it all, you will need to keep living your own life for their sake, while supporting them through your own happiness and success. Try and be strong for when the time comes that they will both need you more, but don't hold it against yourself if you cannot be there as much as you would like.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4665051460403656823/yanyosuten-re:-Eating-Schedule-for-Parkinsons-Rx?	yanyosuten re: Eating Schedule for Parkinson’s Rx?	"PD meds are carried in the blood by the same mechanisms that carry amino acids (formed by breaking down protein), so usually people are advised to take meds at least 30 minutes after meals. Each person seems to have specific proteins that affect this more or less, the only way to find out what her specific ""problem"" proteins are is with trial and error. As far as medication is concerned, carbohydrate only meals are 'fine', and can even clear out the amino acids in the system to assist med absorption, but it there is a some indication the carb heavy lifestyle is what contributed to developing PD in the first place (see Grain Brain by Dr. Perlmutter). So I'm hesitant to offer that as a real solution. Another reason to be mindful of the eating schedule is due to the fact that PD (and the meds for it) comes with heavy constipation, so the longer it's been since she's cleared her bowels, the more difficulty her body will have absorbing medication. If the medication is in her digestive track for too long it will become ineffective due to the short half life of the medication (1,5 hr for levodopa / carbidopa drugs like Sinemet). If you want to find sources on this, search for levodopa + protein, levodopa + diet. My guess is your MIL has a carb heavy diet, snacks a lot and is very specific about her eating habits. Some people have made amazing progress combating PD's through ketogenic diets but this is usually impossible to get people who are on the ""carb train"" to transition towards due to the fear about fats and the difficulty protein heavy diets present because of the issue described in the first part of my answer. Also, the lack of mental acuity that seems to come with PD's for many people makes it hard to try new things, change can usually come only slowly unless initiated by the patient themselves as far as I've seen in my own experiences. edit: spelling.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4665051464102751208/yanyosuten-re:-Sleeping-with-Parkinson's	yanyosuten re: Sleeping with Parkinson's	avoid eating heavy meals and snacks late in the night. avoid strong lights at night, consider installing red lights for the night time, since they don't trigger the same responses in the brain as blue light does. alcohol helps getting to sleep, but makes you wake up more easily once actually sleeping, so also something to avoid if possible. If you're getting bloodwork done some time, check for potassium levels, vitamion b6 and b12. He'll need to eat a lot banana's and / or avocado's to get to the recommended daily levels of potassium without supplements or animal products (pork / yoghurt). Lacking b6 and b12 can be supplemented for, or by eating liver (but usually problematic due to levodopa meds and their competing with proteins). try and stimulate a good circadian rhythm by exposing him to bright (sun)light in the morning around the time he should be waking up. avoid looking at the clock when waking up during the night. avoid watching television in the bedroom or other light sources. get enough fluids during the day and avoid fluid intake in the hours before going to bed to reduce chances of waking up for toilet visits. and last but not least be careful with any type of prescribed sleeping pills. Once dependent on them they often cause more issues than they resolve since they are usually intended for short term use, but the sleeping problems won't go away with many PD patients. Your average doctor / gp is not always aware of the full implications that come with PD, and will possible prescribe pretty crazy meds (like benzodiazepines) for sleeping issues. 	1	1	yanyosuten|re|:|Sleeping|with|Parkinson's	avoid|eating|heavy|meals|and|snacks|late|in|the|night|.|avoid|strong|lights|at|night|,|consider|installing|red|lights|for|the|night|time|,|since|they|don't|trigger|the|same|responses|in|the|brain|as|blue|light|does|.|alcohol|helps|getting|to|sleep|,|but|makes|you|wake|up|more|easily|once|actually|sleeping|,|so|also|something|to|avoid|if|possible|.|If|you're|getting|bloodwork|done|some|time|,|check|for|potassium|levels|,|vitamion|b6|and|b12|.|He'll|need|to|eat|a|lot|banana's|and|/|or|avocado's|to|get|to|the|recommended|daily|levels|of|potassium|without|supplements|or|animal|products|(|pork|/|yoghurt|)|.|Lacking|b6|and|b12|can|be|supplemented|for|,|or|by|eating|liver|(|but|usually|problematic|due|to|levodopa|meds|and|their|competing|with|proteins|)|.|try|and|stimulate|a|good|circadian|rhythm|by|exposing|him|to|bright|(|sun|)|light|in|the|morning|around|the|time|he|should|be|waking|up|.|avoid|looking|at|the|clock|when|waking|up|during|the|night|.|avoid|watching|television|in|the|bedroom|or|other|light|sources|.|get|enough|fluids|during|the|day|and|avoid|fluid|intake|in|the|hours|before|going|to|bed|to|reduce|chances|of|waking|up|for|toilet|visits|.|and|last|but|not|least|be|careful|with|any|type|of|prescribed|sleeping|pills|.|Once|dependent|on|them|they|often|cause|more|issues|than|they|resolve|since|they|are|usually|intended|for|short|term|use|,|but|the|sleeping|problems|won't|go|away|with|many|PD|patients|.|Your|average|doctor|/|gp|is|not|always|aware|of|the|full|implications|that|come|with|PD|,|and|will|possible|prescribe|pretty|crazy|meds|(|like|benzodiazepines|)|for|sleeping|issues|.

My mom has Parkinson's disease, symptoms showed in 2011, diagnosed 2 years later. She was 56 when symptoms showed. I have a few risk increasing genes in my DNA (ancestry dna test, analyzed raw dump using promethease). Looks like green tea, regular high intensity workouts, managing weight, and staying away from direct exposure to herbicides/pesticides might (might!) help reduce chances of getting PD. Going to have regular neurological exams (yearly? I'm 35M). Anyone know of any studies where they track symptoms, reflexes, brain scans, whatever?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4662803687323766956/Is-there-any-difference-between-parkinson-syndrome-and-parkinson's-disease?	Is there any difference between parkinson syndrome and parkinson's disease?	My mom has shaky head for the last couple of years ('Yes-Yes' type), she's 60 years old. Last week doctor diagnosed her with parkinson syndrome. I specifically asked her if this is the parkinson disease? She said no, it's parkinson syndrome and that she looked at the brain scans. It was a brief speak, and I didn't manage to get more information out of her, will talk more in couple of days. But is there really any difference between two? They have her brain scans and all, and they started giving her levadopa/carbidopa already. If this is not parkinson, why are they giving her levadopa? It's no different then? Also, can I postpone taking levadopa medication for some time? My mom can function absolutely normal, hands, legs and other body parts are not affected, it's the head tremor which is the problem so far. I wouldn't want her to start taking levadopa right away if she functions normal, as I heard after years of levadopa it developes into dyskinesia and it's 10 times worse than any parkinson, if levadopa doesn't cure, and only leads to dyskinesia, what's the less evil? having dyskinesia or parkinson symptoms? I live in one of the poorest countries in the world, and the healthcare here is pretty bad, it's nothing close compared to medicine in developed first world countries.

I have a theory, based on an exhaustive double blind study of three people, two of which I hardly knew. My father has Parkinson's, so did his father and brother. All of them had significant trauma in their lives from emotional and sexual abuse. My theory is that the Parkinson's is a result of untreated abuse and terror. Fear. Big chunky lumps of fear. So my advice to you is if you have untreated trauma or childhood abuse of any kind of in your history, or if your family has any kind of history of abuse, because ptsd can be passed down through generations, get working through therapy or whatever works in releasing it. Then even if my crackpot theory turns out to be wrong, you will be in a much better place to deal with the illness, but I don't think that it is. 	1	1	arkofjoy|re|:|Am|I|going|to|have|Parkinsons|?

CaptainKoconut re: A website that has great breakdowns on scientific progress in Parkinson’s. Very easy to understand.	Not my site. Just a site I found that has good breakdowns of the latest research. The front page does have a lot of other stuff on there, but elsewhere on the site are great breakdowns of current and pertinent research. The guy definitely could remove some of that extraneous stuff from the front end of his site. There’s a lot of confusing/junk science out there, and this is one of the few sites I found that lays it out in a digestible manner without removing too many of the important details. I was motivated to post that here because I see so many posts on here that don’t really explain the science well, completely misrepresent it, or are just wrong. For example, this post on exenetide does a great job of explaining why this diabetes drug might be a treatment for PD: https://scienceofparkinsons.com/2018/06/13/exenatide/ If you have a better resource, I’d truly love to see it, and if the mods really think this should be removed, then I wouldn’t argue with them. 	1	0	CaptainKoconut|re|:|A|website|that|has|great|breakdowns|on|scientific|progress|in|Parkinson|’|s|.|Very|easy|to|understand|.

He easily falls down, he some kind of dementia and his general physical condition is really bad altough he can make himself food etc.. &#x200B; Now last week the doctor diagnosed atypical parkinson and said that he would estimate the lifespan my father has left about 3-6 years. Has anyone of you gone through something similar? I really dont know what to do i really do love my father but when i go to see him it makes me so sad and i get really depressed since hes not the person i know anymore, but i do know i have only limited time left with him.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4658205347040137746/Could-these-be-early-parkinsons-signs?	Could these be early parkinsons signs?	First I just want to say that my grandmother had parkinsons, and as far as I know, no one else in my family has it. I have autoimmune issues, including psoriasis that I managed to put into remission through the AIP diet, and other autoimmune problems that are undiagnosed (at this point im guessing fibromyalgia and or arthritis). When I eating this diet most weird and uncomfortable symptoms go away, but it's a very strict diet and hard to stick to. Also I am 24, F. Symptoms: * Lately I have felt like my tongue was receding to the back, without my control. I thought I was just imagining things and panicking, so I consciously relaxed my tongue and it went away. But it has happened a lot of times since. Most notably tonight when I had a small amount of chardonnay. Every time I took quite a few sips, this would happen. * My hand sometimes slightly shakes. Never really thought much of it until lately, along with other symptoms, and the fact that it happens more when I'm eating inflammatory foods. * I get this feeling in my face muscles, as if I have been laughing a lot. I also get this feeling in my legs. For no reason. * Muscle twitches/spasms in random body parts. Lately my eyelid, my lower right tummy, and my thigh. * Sometimes I feel like my muscles are thinking of doing something different, like there's a slight delay. Only a fraction of a second, but i can feel it. Like they have a mind of their own and are just thinking about it, not acting on it. * Along with the tongue and face thing, sometimes it feels like my jaw is a bit locked. It's only just enough for me to notice. Enough to think I was imagining things if it weren't for the other symptoms. So if anyone here has parkinsons, what do you think of this? Do you think it could be parkinsons, or something else? If you think it could be parkinsons, what should I do? What tests should I get? Who should I see? 	1	1	Could|these|be|early|parkinsons|signs|?

Pragmatic solutions for dealing with talking/screaming in sleep from parkinsons?	"Anyone have experience dealing with this, as either a caregiver or patient? We're under the impression it's REM sleep disorder at this point. His doctors threw klonopin at the problem (over the phone, but I digress), which did solve the problem for the ~week he was on it, but he had a noticeable increase in number of falls so he ceased taking it. He was also noticeably less sharp and less ""with it"" mentally throughout the day, despite only taking it at night before sleep, so I'm happy to see him off of it from a quality of life standpoint. I haven't slept through a night since he stopped taking it, and I work for a living. I sleep the next room over, and I'm weighing the pros and cons of wearing ear plugs to sleep, but my main concern is I won't wake up for a bad fall. Are there alternatives to clonazepam/klonopin that anyone has experience with for this? Ironically, he has a hard time speaking with enough volume to be audible throughout the day, but he has no problem cranking that volume up to full on screaming in his sleep.

After looking at a bunch of research, I truely believe science is close to significantly halting progression, if not outright curing Parkinson's disease. I believe this halting, and outright cure of PD will come in two different areas. 1. Eliminating gut dysbiosis by establishing a good microbiome via fecal transplant: https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/9dnvi0/tremendous_link_between_neurological_disorders/ 2. Stem cells directly injected into the substantia nigra to repair or outright regrow the damaged dopamine producing neurons in that region of the brain: https://www.cureparkinsons.org.uk/News/stem-cell-treatment-for-parkinsons There is an upcomming trial regarding fecal transplants to restore gut microbiome: https://www.clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT03026231? cond=microbiota+transplantation+parkinson&rank=1 Stem cells have shown to work in animal models but are there any current human clinical trials involving stem cells and humans? Yes Some are already occurring and are scheduled to be finished in 2019. 2019 looks to be a big year for results: Here are the clinical trials regarding stem cells and Parkinson's: One trial is enrolling by invitation and is scheduled to be end of 2018 (this year): https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT03128450 This trial is scheduled to be finished in July 2019: https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT02184546 This trial is scheduled to be finished in June 2019: https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT03309514 This trial is scheduled to be finished in December 2019: https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT02452723 Exciting times! 	1	0	Stem|cells|and|Parkinson's|disease|-|The|current|state|of|things|in|2018	2019|looks|to|be|a|big|year|for|PD|!|After|looking|at|a|bunch|of|research|,|I|truely|believe|science|is|close|to|significantly|halting|progression|,|if|not|outright|curing|Parkinson's|disease|.|I|believe|this|halting|,|and|outright|cure|of|PD|will|come|in|two|different|areas|.|1|.|Eliminating|gut|dysbiosis|by|establishing|a|good|microbiome|via|fecal|transplant|:|https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/9dnvi0/tremendous_link_between_neurological_disorders/|2|.|Stem|cells|directly|injected|into|the|substantia|nigra|to|repair|or|outright|regrow|the|damaged|dopamine|producing|neurons|in|that|region|of|the|brain|:|https://www.cureparkinsons.org.uk/News/stem-cell-treatment-for-parkinsons|There|is|an|upcomming|trial|regarding|fecal|transplants|to|restore|gut|microbiome|:|https://www.clinicaltrials|.|gov|/|ct2|/|show|/|NCT|03026231|?|cond|=|microbiota|+|transplantation|+|parkinson|&|rank|=|1|Stem|cells|have|shown|to|work|in|animal|models|but|are|there|any|current|human|clinical|trials|involving|stem|cells|and|humans|?|Yes|Some|are|already|occurring|and|are|scheduled|to|be|finished|in|2019|.|2019|looks|to|be|a|big|year|for|results|:|Here|are|the|clinical|trials|regarding|stem|cells|and|Parkinson's|:|One|trial|is|enrolling|by|invitation|and|is|scheduled|to|be|end|of|2018|(|this|year|):|https://clinicaltrials|.|gov|/|ct2|/|show|/|NCT|03128450|This|trial|is|scheduled|to|be|finished|in|July|2019|:|https://clinicaltrials|.|gov|/|ct2|/|show|/|NCT|02184546|This|trial|is|scheduled|to|be|finished|in|June|2019|:|https://clinicaltrials|.|gov|/|ct2|/|show|/|NCT|03309514|This|trial|is|scheduled|to|be|finished|in|December|2019|:|https://clinicaltrials|.|gov|/|ct2|/|show|/|NCT|02452723|Exciting|times|!

Parkinson’s disease and other neurological diseases link to dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota (gut bacteria). The following few articles and excerpts of research show a tremendous link between neurological disorders and intestinal microbiota via the “gut brain axis” and the dysbiosis that occurs in PD patients. “Dysbiosis” is a term for a microbial imbalance or maladaptation on or inside the body. Once this Dysbiosis is corrected, some amazing things happened (read studies below) Excerpts from a 2016 Pub Med. gov US National Library of Medicine Nation Institutes of Health article: Titled: “Gut Microbiota Regulate Motor Deficits and Neuroinflammation in a Model of Parkinson's Disease. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed/27912057 “The intestinal microbiota influence neurodevelopment, modulate behavior, and contribute to neurological disorders. Using mice that overexpress αSyn, we report herein that gut microbiota are required for motor deficits, microglia activation, and αSyn pathology. Antibiotic treatment ameliorates, while microbial re-colonization promotes, pathophysiology in adult animals, suggesting that postnatal signaling between the gut and the brain modulates disease. Indeed, oral administration of specific microbial metabolites to germ-free mice promotes neuroinflammation and motor symptoms. Remarkably, colonization of αSyn-overexpressing mice with microbiota from PD-affected patients enhances physical impairments compared to microbiota transplants from healthy human donors. These findings reveal that gut bacteria regulate movement disorders in mice and suggest that alterations in the human microbiome represent a risk factor for PD.” Excerpts from a 2018 Pub Med. gov US National Library of Medicine Nation Institutes of Health article:Titled: “Dysbiosis of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in Parkinson's Disease.” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed/29705121 “Gut microbial dysbiosis and alteration of microbial metabolites in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been increasingly reported. Dysbiosis in the composition and abundance of gut microbiota can affect both the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system (CNS), indicating the existence of a microbiota-gut-brain axis and thereby causing CNS diseases. Disturbance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis has been linked to specific microbial products that are related to gut inflammation and neuroinflammation. Future directions should therefore focus on the exploration of specific gut microbes or microbial metabolites that contribute to the development of PD. Microbiota-targeted interventions, such as antibiotics, probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation, have been shown to favorably affect host health.” Ok, so there is a strong link between neurological disorders and intestinal microbiota via the “gut brain axis”. What happens in animal (mice models) when fecal transplants happen from healthy people to PD mice? Excerpts from a 2018 Pub Med. gov US National Library of Medicine Nation Institutes of Health article: Titled: “Neuroprotective effects of fecal microbiota transplantation on MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice: Gut microbiota, glial reaction and TLR4/TNF-α signaling pathway.” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed/29471030 “Parkinson's disease (PD) patients display alterations in gut microbiota composition. Remarkably, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) reduced gut microbial dysbiosis, decreased fecal SCFAs, alleviated physical impairment, and increased striatal DA and 5-HT content of PD mice. Further, FMT reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the substantia nigra, and reduced expression of TLR4/TNF-α signaling pathway components in gut and brain. Our study demonstrates that gut microbial dysbiosis is involved in PD pathogenesis, and FMT can protect PD mice by suppressing neuroinflammation and reducing TLR4/TNF-α signaling.” OK, so a fecal transplant “reduced gut microbial dysbiosis, decreased fecal SCFAs, alleviated physical impairment, and increased striatal DA and 5-HT content of PD mice.” With all this promising information, It looks like there was a recent study started fecal microbiota transplantation in subjects with Parkinson's Disease (PD) that started in January 2017: https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT03026231 Unfortunately, as of August 2018, the recruitment status says “withdrawn (study will be started under a new modified protocol)” The questions then are: 1. What does “new modified protocol” mean? 2. When will the new study start? Some things to think about: 3. With all the promising info we know about a tremendous link between neurological disorders and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis via the “gut brain axis” and the dysbiosis that occurs in PD patients, why aren’t more clinical trials being done/started regarding fecal transplants and PD? a. https://www.clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/results? cond=microbiota+transplantation+parkinson&term=&cntry=&state=&city=&dist= b. I was thinking about writing “The University of Texas Health Science center"" (the sponsor of the the clinical trial) but have not yet. Does anyone have any more information on this? 4. The government/FDA is currently very restrictive on what regulated fecal transplants are approved for and the disease doctors can treat. Currently, its only approved for C. Difficile 5. When can the public get safe regulated/monitored/quality controlled (not youtube do it yourself versions) fecal transplants other then for C. Difficile? a. An example of ""safe/regulated/monitored/quality controlled is the company ""Open Biome"" that monitors, inspects and keeps tabs on quality of fecal transplant material. 6. Should more be done by us to push the government to get more ""off label use"" of regulated fecal transplants considering fecal transplants have already been done safetly for the last 50 years and it has a 1700 year history: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pmc/articles/PMC4977816/ After reviewing a bunch of research it appears that there is a tremendous link between neurological disorders and intestinal microbiota via the “gut brain axis” and the dysbiosis that occurs in PD patients. This is a very promising field of research regarding PD and other brain or body diseases such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, metabolic, autoimmune diseases, autism, multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome. Hopefully we can push the right entities to start clinical trials of fecal transplants and PD and for opening up the restrictions on ""off label use"" of fecal transplants currently in place by the FDA/government.

The film revolves around a young, classical pianist who is diagnosed with Young Onset Parkinson’s Disease and the Punk band that changes his life. The film is being made in association with Young Parkinson’s Ireland, and 20% of all the funds raised via our gofundme are being donated to charity - as are any profits made by the film. So far we have raised half of the funds needed to complete the film, but are still €2,500 short of our goal. The film was made on a zero-budget with everyone involved giving their time and skill for free.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4645493451724631525/New-diagnosis,-no-one-to-vent-to.	New diagnosis, no one to vent to.	I was officially diagnosed a month ago, after suspecting/fearing for years. My neurologist suspects I've had very slowly progressive disease for 20 years, or so (when I first noted left hand and leg tremor - very occasionally). I thought reduced arm swing was due to my rotator cuff tear, left hand stiffness due to xray-obvious arthritis, softer speech and lower mood due to new social isolation after move, job change. Probably all true, but I also have PD. I'm 59 with 4 grown kids, 4 siblings, mom and a very nice partner. I've only told him. Don't know how to talk about this with crying hysterically. I've started the cycling program (85rpm for 30-40 min 4 x week). Neuro suggests I wait to start meds. I work hard to approximate normal walk. I am hyper self-conscious of how I think I appear and seem. Any advice? How can I talk about this? Or should I? I still need to work and don't want word out. 	1	1	New|diagnosis|,|no|one|to|vent|to|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4644139786385976042/Update-about-medication-induced-psychosis	Update about medication induced psychosis	"I [posted not long ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/92bmfe/anti_pd_medications_causing_serious_psychotic/) about someone I know who got Parkinson's 2 years ago and started medication 2 months ago. 1 month ago, he suddenly developed serious psychosis — seeing spiders, being convinced that ""they"" are watching, that his phone is bugged, that his old dog is still alive, and other really worrying things. In the course of a few days, he went from being a totally normal person with some difficulty walking to an absolute crazy person who has no idea who he is and what's going on around him. He has had Parkinson's that was progressing slowly for about 2 years. When he started medication, it all went downhill and now there doesn't seem to be a way to go back, since the medication causes dependence. After weeks of begging doctors, he was finally brought to the hospital to the neurology, but soon ended up being transferred and locked up in the psychiatric ward due to psychotic behavior. Now he's not allowed to leave (not that he could in this condition). Ever since he got to the hospital, his condition has gotten much worse. You know those films where there's an over-the-top stereotypical crazy guy? It's like that. No contact with reality and no way to communicate with him. Seeing things, hearing voices, being strongly convinced of things that aren't true. His doctor had no clue what's going on, suspects that it's due to the medication but now that he's dependent on the medication, it can't be stopped. His prescribed medication is: * Yumex (the instructions say that it should be taken separately from Madopar but doctors administer it together with Madopar for some reason) * PK-Merz (no longer taking it due to it making psychosis even worse) * Madopar (4 halves a day causes severe psychosis but it's not enough to allow him to move, now taking 3 halves a day, still quite a lot of psychosis and not able to move much) Stopping medication now makes him *completely* unable to move, as in unable to swallow or even lift his hands or move his head. However, stopping medication also stops his psychosis. Starting medication again will again start psychosis and slightly improve his movement (he can maybe stand up with a lot of effort, but will fall over). This is in a country with only social healthcare, so there is no private option. You are assigned to a doctor and you don't get to choose no matter how rich you are. I don't know what there is to do. Any advice? Is this just how Parkinson's goes? I've heard of deep brain stimulation surgery, does that help with psychosis? The only thing that worries me is that this is not due to Parkinson's, but rather the side effect of the medication. So if it weren't for the medication, he would just be a normal person who needs a walking cane to get around. Now he's a psychotic mess locked up in a psychiatric ward.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4642864607710003313/My-dad-55M-might-have-early-on-set-Parkinsons	My dad [55M] might have early on-set Parkinson’s	My dad is 55 years old, high ranking Army commander who will retire in a year and a half. After recent news of the actor Alan Alda’s diagnosis with Parkinson’s Disease, my mom realized that he might have PD, too. Last year, he started walking slowly (PD gait?) and had trouble using his right hand. No resting tremors, only when he tries to bend the fingers on his hand does it tremble. But we thought his slow gait was because of a foot injury/surgery he had due to an incident during one of his Army tours in the Middle East and to arthritis, which his doctor recently told him he has. He also has a compressed spine with herniated discs (?) due to years of wearing heavy packs as an airborne/paratrooper and has been having vivid dreams where he will drool excessively and act out by talking and moving in his sleep. He was diagnosed with PTSD several years ago and is a disabled vet. His body has definitely taken a beating over the years due to the Army. Thank goodness he will have great retirement income when he retires. His current job doesn’t require him to do much either so he is able to wind down during these last few months before retirement. My dad has had problems dealing with stress for his entire life and I’m sure it’s one of the causes of PD if that is what he has. I never thought my dad would suffer like this so early. You think being so healthy and active, it would never happen to you. But mental health is so important too and he has never considered managing his own mental health and stress. He’s been through a lot and I’m scared for him. I know he is depressed right now and will turn to alcohol as a way to cope. Maybe this diagnosis will help him quit drinking once and for all. He has an appointment in two weeks to confirm whether or not he has PD and it seems very certain he has it. I am so sad and worried and researching about PD over the internet. We know it’s not a terminal illness and he can still live a long healthy life. But he is an excessive drinker to the point where it’s probably safe to call him an alcoholic. Will this make PD worse? I read online that it varies between patients. I also read that if caught early and treated, it can slow progression. If signs were present only last year, is it still considered early to help? I want him to get counseling and physical therapy immediately, like right now. 	1	1	My|dad|[|55M|]|might|have|early|on-set|Parkinson|’|s	My|dad|is|55|years|old|,|high|ranking|Army|commander|who|will|retire|in|a|year|and|a|half|.|After|recent|news|of|the|actor|Alan|Alda|’|s|diagnosis|with|Parkinson|’|s|Disease|,|my|mom|realized|that|he|might|have|PD|,|too|.|Last|year|,|he|started|walking|slowly|(|PD|gait|?|)|and|had|trouble|using|his|right|hand|.|No|resting|tremors|,|only|when|he|tries|to|bend|the|fingers|on|his|hand|does|it|tremble|.|But|we|thought|his|slow|gait|was|because|of|a|foot|injury|/|surgery|he|had|due|to|an|incident|during|one|of|his|Army|tours|in|the|Middle|East|and|to|arthritis|,|which|his|doctor|recently|told|him|he|has|.|He|also|has|a|compressed|spine|with|herniated|discs|(|?|)|due|to|years|of|wearing|heavy|packs|as|an|airborne|/|paratrooper|and|has|been|having|vivid|dreams|where|he|will|drool|excessively|and|act|out|by|talking|and|moving|in|his|sleep|.|He|was|diagnosed|with|PTSD|several|years|ago|and|is|a|disabled|vet|.|His|body|has|definitely|taken|a|beating|over|the|years|due|to|the|Army|.|Thank|goodness|he|will|have|great|retirement|income|when|he|retires|.|His|current|job|doesn|’|t|require|him|to|do|much|either|so|he|is|able|to|wind|down|during|these|last|few|months|before|retirement|.|My|dad|has|had|problems|dealing|with|stress|for|his|entire|life|and|I|’|m|sure|it|’|s|one|of|the|causes|of|PD|if|that|is|what|he|has|.|I|never|thought|my|dad|would|suffer|like|this|so|early|.|You|think|being|so|healthy|and|active|,|it|would|never|happen|to|you|.|But|mental|health|is|so|important|too|and|he|has|never|considered|managing|his|own|mental|health|and|stress|.|He|’|s|been|through|a|lot|and|I|’|m|scared|for|him|.|I|know|he|is|depressed|right|now|and|will|turn|to|alcohol|as|a|way|to|cope|.|Maybe|this|diagnosis|will|help|him|quit|drinking|once|and|for|all|.|He|has|an|appointment|in|two|weeks|to|confirm|whether|or|not|he|has|PD|and|it|seems|very|certain|he|has|it|.|I|am|so|sad|and|worried|and|researching|about|PD|over|the|internet|.|We|know|it|’|s|not|a|terminal|illness|and|he|can|still|live|a|long|healthy|life|.|But|he|is|an|excessive|drinker|to|the|point|where|it|’|s|probably|safe|to|call|him|an|alcoholic|.|Will|this|make|PD|worse|?|I|read|online|that|it|varies|between|patients|.|I|also|read|that|if|caught|early|and|treated|,|it|can|slow|progression|.|If|signs|were|present|only|last|year|,|is|it|still|considered|early|to|help|?|I|want|him|to|get|counseling|and|physical|therapy|immediately|,|like|right|now|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4636550630671439216/Anti-PD-medications-causing-serious-psychotic-symptoms	Anti PD medications causing serious psychotic symptoms	"I have a 75 year old male friend with fairly bad PD. He was recently put on anti-PD medication and the side effects are worse than the PD itself. On the first day he had total urine retention and could not urinate at all, so was given a catheter. And now, a few weeks later, he suddenly started exhibiting serious psychotic symptoms, including auditory and visual hallucinations, no track of reality and time, and paranoid delusions. He believes that everyone is against him, that there are ants on the walls, and hearing voices, believing his long-dead dog is still around, etc... He lives alone and can't even keep track of taking his own medication. He also fell over and hit his head *hard* on the floor (pool of blood). This is all due to the side effects and him not being able to keep track of the correct dosage. He has no clue of what he took/needs to take, maybe he's taking too much or not enough, no one knows. Sometimes he can't even move, with entire body rigidness. We called an ambulance but they said they can't treat him, beyond giving him basic emergency treatment which won't help with the psychotic symptoms. His head is fine now physically but his psychotic symptoms are getting worse. We called his doctor but he's on vacation and said ""he can't help"" and that we shouldn't bother him while he's on vacation. We called a bunch of other places but no one can help, no one gives a shit, they have no clue. Anyway, while we figure out how to get him into a hospital, we need a short-term emergency solution. I know that stopping medication is dangerous. But continuing the medication is even more dangerous. What is the correct course of action in a case like this? Sorry for asking for medical advice but when no doctor, hospital or ambulance can help, I have to turn to the internet or he will be dead very soon. *** **Update:** His medications are **Madopar** (4 halves a day), **Jumex** and **PK-MERZ**. We've figured out through trial and error that PK-MERZ is the main culprit, and we stopped giving it to him. He has improved a lot immediately, with psychosis going away completely and movement improving. However, every time he is given Madopar, psychosis returns for a while, but doesn't stay indefinitely. It seems that Madopar acts very fast and the sudden influx of dopamine causes psychosis. Jumex seems to multiply the effect of Madopar and therefore shouldn't be given at the same time.

I have lived with in a house with her, my grandad, and my uncle for just over two years now and i feel like i’m just watching her die.... She has parkinsons, arthritis, osteoporosis, is very hard of hearing, has lost all her teeth due to two decades worth of daily medications, was diagnosed with cancer last year, and dementia is now taking over too. This evening i finally got to speak to her (i work 9-5 but my commute is an hour so i leave earlier and arrive back later) because she’s constantly asleep whenever i go into her room to say hello. I almost wish i hadn’t gone in there. She was all over the place. She doesn’t know what time or day it is, asked me questions about my partner which she knows the answer to, has forgotten its her granddaughters (my sisters) 18th birthday... I’m moving away in 2 months. My uncle said originally that i should call and speak to her whenever i get the chance once i have moved.

Hey /r/Parkinsons, I'm the Global Product Manager for Augmentative/Alternative Communication Software for Tobii Dynavox.	"See title, essentially! I'm a longtime redditor but want to re-introduce myself. This isn't a promotional post at all; my main goal is to ensure that people have a direct line of contact. Two weeks ago now I started a new position at Tobii Dynavox as Global Product Manager for Augmentative/Alternative Communication (AAC) Symbol Software, which roughly equates to everything pediatric, although I have a lot of experience and involvement with the eye tracking hardware and other products as well. Prior to this I've been an SLP in the schools and in private practice as well as an AAC developer with Avaz and others; I also do a podcast on AAC called Talking With Tech (and founded a thing called SpeechScience that used to get posted here quite a bit, which I merged into another organization when considering this job). Without going into too much detail, suffice to say that the community around speech generating devices is very personal to me. I passionately believe that communication is a human right and that ""complicated bodies hold clever minds."" While obviously only a percentage of those with Parkinsons end up using AAC, I still wanted to put myself out here as a resource. I want to extend an invitation to please consider me as a point of contact in the future for any needs you might have. I will try to pay attention to the various forums, and certainly I can be responsive about AAC questions generally here on reddit (whether or not they're relevant to T/D products), but I'm sure I'll miss things so feel free to message or email me at lucas.steuber@tobiidynavox.com. If I don't know the answer I should at least be able to find it for you, and I want to make sure I'm aware of any obstacles, successes, as well as feedback as to how we can make solutions better in the future. I have a very distinct set of priorities entering into this position and engaging with, supporting, and overall being accessible to the community is probably the most important. Your thoughts and concerns WILL be heard, and I'd love to listen to ideas individually or build some long-term relationships for ongoing feedback. So! Consider me at your service, and any questions are welcome in regard to Tobii Dynavox stuff, AAC, or whatever else generally.

This is a worrying symptom, and unfortunately occurs commonly in Parkinson's. It's worrying because if he's choking and coughing when eating, it shows that his swallowing reflex is not working properly. Swallowing is a mix of voluntary and involuntary muscle movements, and either one of these could be malfunctioning. If he's started to choke when swallowing solid food, there is a high likelihood that he will also choke when swallowing liquids. This can lead to the liquid going into the airways instead of the oesophagus, which in turn can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia can lead to serious illness. I recommend making an appointment with a speech therapist. They will assess his swallowing function and see if it is safe for him to continue eating. They can also give him information and exercises to do to maintain his swallowing function. All the best, I hope this helps a little. 	1	1	gin_tonic_kintsugi|re|:|Advice|required|-|Choking|on|food|with|Parkinsons	Sorry|to|hear|how|things|are|going|with|your|father|.|This|is|a|worrying|symptom|,|and|unfortunately|occurs|commonly|in|Parkinson's|.|It's|worrying|because|if|he's|choking|and|coughing|when|eating|,|it|shows|that|his|swallowing|reflex|is|not|working|properly|.|Swallowing|is|a|mix|of|voluntary|and|involuntary|muscle|movements|,|and|either|one|of|these|could|be|malfunctioning|.|If|he's|started|to|choke|when|swallowing|solid|food|,|there|is|a|high|likelihood|that|he|will|also|choke|when|swallowing|liquids|.|This|can|lead|to|the|liquid|going|into|the|airways|instead|of|the|oesophagus|,|which|in|turn|can|lead|to|pneumonia|.|Pneumonia|can|lead|to|serious|illness|.|I|recommend|making|an|appointment|with|a|speech|therapist|.|They|will|assess|his|swallowing|function|and|see|if|it|is|safe|for|him|to|continue|eating|.|They|can|also|give|him|information|and|exercises|to|do|to|maintain|his|swallowing|function|.|All|the|best|,|I|hope|this|helps|a|little|.

Hi all, my name is Taylor Myers, and I'm a clinical research coordinator with the University of Rochester. The UR Department of Computer Science is developing a new tool in collaboration with the department of Neurology to help individuals with Parkinson's disease and their care providers monitor symptoms of PD. We are currently in need of participants (with and without PD) to try out the tool and provide feedback. Altogether, participation should take about 15 minutes. To take part, please follow [this link](https://parktest.net). The study involves opening the tool in a browser, agreeing to the E-consent form, and turning on your computer's webcam and microphone. The tool will then lead you through a series of recorded tasks. These tasks range from reading a short sentence to tapping your fingers together in view of the camera. After the tasks are complete you will fill out a short demographic survey. For any questions regarding the tool please email [parktoolhelp@gmail.com](mailto:parktoolhelp@gmail.com) or reply to this thread. For a limited time, all those who run through the tool and finish the accompanying survey will receive a $50 Amazon gift card through their email address (as provided in the survey at the end of the study) as compensation for their time and effort.

I am 63 year old who was diagnosed 8 months ago with Parkinson's. I had severe calf pain, muscle pain, slurred speech, frequent falls, loss of balance, difficulty in getting up from sitting position, I was having a problem accepting my diagnosis, even though I read every thing I could find to read. I was put on Sinemet 3 times daily but it didn’t seem to be helping. After 4 months of been diagnosed I was having difficulty writing. Getting in bed, turning over. There has been little if any progress in finding a cure or reliable treatment. So this year our primary physician suggested I started on Natural Herbal Gardens Parkinson’s Herbal formula which eased my anxiety a bit,We ordered their PD herbal treatment after reading alot of positive reviews, i am happy to report with the help of Natural Herbal Garden natural herbs I have been able to reverse my symptoms using herbs,8 weeks into treatment I improved dramatically. At the end of the full treatment course, the disease is totally under control. No case of Slurred Speech, loss of balance, or weakness.

I use both hands to hold the cup! I've mentioned this before, but my PD started really young. No doctors could explain what was going on, I heard every story possible. My medical history didn't make any sense (body reject my skin at age 5, my thyroid stopped working at 12, etc). So when I was 25, during a physically was a bunch of questions about odd things (San Jose, 1983) but the doctor commented if he didn't know better he would have sworn I had Parkinson's. At the time he told me to keep on cycling (I commuted to work on a bicycle, did 100-mile rides on the weekends). It took me almost 30years to have an official diagnosis! My Primary Care Physician noted the tremors for years, always assumed my Thyroid medication was off so checked blood work, it was good, on my way! Oh, spilling coffee and spilling beer. Once my boss bought me a ""real drink"" which was a martini (1983) which the shallow glass and trying to hold with one hand meant it spilled all over the place. His comment ""sorry, I knew you were an alcoholic I wouldn't have bought you a drink!"" Sigh. If you ever make it to Austin, TX please join our workouts. Saturday is pretty cool as we have from age 30 to 80 in one class. Oh, that 80 years old, one time I'm dying as this is the intense class. Three sets of exercises, including 20 push-ups. I finally got the core strength to do a toe push up, straight back, but that last set of 20 was too much. I was ready to drop to my knees to finish. I look over and here is Jim whistling and doing his last 20, on his toes. Crap. I finished them! Whew. Oh after an intense workout I was shaking like crazy, stopped in for a nice beer at a local pub. The clerk asked if I was OK, I just smiled and said we had finished an intense workout, and she smiled and added: ""that happens to me all the time""! No, I didn't say a word.

Thank you so much for this. I've done so much reading on PD recently but I have yet to talk to many people who have gone through it caring for a loved one. Reading books and articles is one thing, but hearing from people who have lived through it is quite another. So, thank you for taking the time to comment. Although I can't plan for anything specifically, I do feel like I need to emotionally prepare for what to expect and then leave room to just roll with things as they happen. Thank you for commenting on difficulty swallowing being a sign that things are moving in the direction of end stage (at least in your best friend's father's case). It will also be difficult gauging where he's at once he loses his speech - I'll have to keep in mind that losing verbal communication doesn't mean he's gone cognitively.

"My FIL (66/m) has been diagnosed with PD for 12 years. We've seen major decline in his cognitive and physical functions in the last18 months. He has never had really bad tremors, but he displays the other classic PD signs - Shuffling while walking, bent over posture, minimal facial expressions, tiny hand writing etc. We are most worried about his executive functioning, it has tanked completely in the last little while and he has maybe 2-3 ""good"" hours in a day. He is recovering from spinal stenosis surgery and we've moved him from his home to an assisted living facility (which he can only afford for maybe 8 more years). He's on the standard PD meds 6 times a day (he's undergone no other treatments). His house has just sold and he lives across the country from us so we manage everything from a distance. We don't want to take him away from his girlfriend, friends and local support system until he needs full time care and is bedridden. From doing reading it looks like he's in stage 3 - 4 of the disease: needs someone to administer meds and meals at the right times, is currently using a walker to get around (the spinal stenosis attributed to this), we don't see freezing gait yet, he's not hallucinating due to PD (we don't think, although he did hallucinate while on percocet after spine surgery), he's not able to plan ahead or stay organized, short term memory is awful, we have taken over paying his bills and managing finances which he's been ok with .... he's not bed ridden and can still move around on his own, although that is limited, he has some trouble sleeping at night and definitely can't seem to stay awake for most of the afternoon (daytime narcolepsy). My questions are: \- What can we expect to see in the next 5 years? \- What will the end of his life look like? I know every person experiences PD differently but I am anxious to know what to expect. Nobody seems to want to talk about this but knowing what to expect will help me plan for it, as shitty as that sounds. \- Will he eventually lose his mind similar to an Alzheimer's patient? Or will he be totally lucid but bedridden/frozen? \- When is the right time to move him to a nursing home? We are Canadian so if any Canadians are reading this it might help me understand this process from a government funding perspective as well. Many, many thanks for anyone out there listening who might have some advice based on their personal experience with a loved one.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4625520924392607502/What-to-do-when-a-parent-won't-seek-medical-attention?	What to do when a parent won't seek medical attention?	"In my opinion, there are two ways to approach potentially dangerous situations: You either worry about the worst possible outcome (which is what I tend to do), or you deny the threat altogether (which is what my Dad is doing). While constant worry sure drains a lot of energy, at least it gets things done at the end of the day. Since I worry excessively, the things I get done usually turn out to be not that bad. My headache wasn't a brain tumour; my bruises wasn't due to cancer; my stomach ache turned out to be period cramps and not appendicitis. Because I tend to go straight to the worst scenario, I've had to teach myself how to think more rationally. So I usually tell myself that it's just my anxiety playing tricks on me (which isn't always a smart move either, but that's besides the point). Now here's the thing: my Dad is a 64 year old man who still hides behind denial like a child trying to get out of trouble. It started maybe two or three years ago with slight tremors in his right hand and fingers. He told me this was because he had ripped off a muscle in his shoulder ten years prior. Yeah, whatever. Maybe that was true, maybe it wasn't. But the tremors kept getting worse. And worse. And worse, yet. Whereas it started off like when you hit your funny bone, resulting in tingling; it's now at the point where I can hear he's reading the newspaper from across the apartment due to the severity of his hand shaking against the pages. It's also worth mentioning that about 15 years ago, he fell and broke his foot. He was left with a slight limp due to a lack of proper rehabilitation. This limp gets worse when he's been walking around a lot. On the other hand, I had foot surgery in 2010 and I can walk just fine without pain. So when his limp got worse, he explained this away, too; it was because of the surgery one and a half decade ago. But everything just keeps getting worse and worse. On top of his walking and his tremors, he's also lost a lot of weight, it's getting harder and harder for him to get up from the couch at the first attempt, and just yesterday he casually mentioned, after drinking a glass of water, how lately it's like the water goes down the trachea instead of the esophagus. I mean, if this was something that didn't get increasingly worse over several years, I wouldn't be bothered, and I'd attribute the sinking feeling in my stomach to my own anxiousness. But I do think the evidence pretty clearly points to him probably struggling with Parkinson's. At one time I remember my ex even asked him about his hand, and he kind of brushed it off and said ""The doctors are talking about Parkinson's(!), but that's only because they won't listen to me"", referring to the doctors ""not listening"" to his babbling about his surgery and ripped-off muscle in the shoulder. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I can't even look at his arm because he'll notice I'm worried and he'll know that I'm thinking about Parkinson's -- which he probably is too, somewhere deep down -- and it'll make him feel bad. I also can't confront him straight up because he's stubborn and will refuse to listen; there's even a risk he'll avoid medical attention even more if I talk to him about it. I have a chronic disability myself since birth and while I sure denied things when I was a kid, I've since realised that doing so won't change the fact that it is there; all it does is making it potentially worse because you're skipping on medication or other forms of treatment. I just... Ugh. It's so hard watching someone who's always been my best friend slowly melt away like that.

I’m attending her RSB 3x week and PD classes at local hospital 3x week with her. Look around for local programs through the hospitals. My observation with respect to exercise is that anything involving cross body motion is beneficial. Essentially the trainers strive to get the participants to mobilize with a left foot step and a right arm swing followed by right step left arm. Many of the participants really struggle with this as they progress with the disease. All of the exercises tend to this cross body motion or “two things at once” action so I would suggest things like riding an exercise bike that has moving handles that the rider pulls in addition to pedaling, strider machines that simulate cross country skiing etc. Additionally the classes work on strengthening vocal chords and throat muscles by having participants count by shouting out and by having folks shout out a state name when the right arm is up and shouting a number when the left arm is up, not easy but makes the brain and body work harder. The classes we attend are humbling, there are those newly diagnosed who can take on bigger challenges at earlier stages and there are those like my mother who need to be spotted by a carer, It would benefit you to attend as well as you will get a very good idea of how things progress (though at different pace for each person) and it’s an incredibly supportive environment. 	1	1	PGTipsta|re|:|Father|diagnosed|with|Parkinson's	Mom|is|79|-|PD|Dx|at|78|but|that|was|long|in|the|process|,|symptoms|were|present|for|past|3|years|.|I|’|m|attending|her|RSB|3x|week|and|PD|classes|at|local|hospital|3x|week|with|her|.|Look|around|for|local|programs|through|the|hospitals|.|My|observation|with|respect|to|exercise|is|that|anything|involving|cross|body|motion|is|beneficial|.|Essentially|the|trainers|strive|to|get|the|participants|to|mobilize|with|a|left|foot|step|and|a|right|arm|swing|followed|by|right|step|left|arm|.|Many|of|the|participants|really|struggle|with|this|as|they|progress|with|the|disease|.|All|of|the|exercises|tend|to|this|cross|body|motion|or|“|two|things|at|once|”|action|so|I|would|suggest|things|like|riding|an|exercise|bike|that|has|moving|handles|that|the|rider|pulls|in|addition|to|pedaling|,|strider|machines|that|simulate|cross|country|skiing|etc|.|Additionally|the|classes|work|on|strengthening|vocal|chords|and|throat|muscles|by|having|participants|count|by|shouting|out|and|by|having|folks|shout|out|a|state|name|when|the|right|arm|is|up|and|shouting|a|number|when|the|left|arm|is|up|,|not|easy|but|makes|the|brain|and|body|work|harder|.|The|classes|we|attend|are|humbling|,|there|are|those|newly|diagnosed|who|can|take|on|bigger|challenges|at|earlier|stages|and|there|are|those|like|my|mother|who|need|to|be|spotted|by|a|carer|,|It|would|benefit|you|to|attend|as|well|as|you|will|get|a|very|good|idea|of|how|things|progress|(|though|at|different|pace|for|each|person|)|and|it|’|s|an|incredibly|supportive|environment|.

While medical management is very important for the disease, staying physically active is one of the things we can do in our lives that makes a huge difference. Exercise has been shown to slow and in some instances reverse symptoms. While an exercise program including big movements, lifting heavy weights, and aerobics is thought to be best, for many people it is not possible. The most important part of any exercise program is actually doing it.

I don't know tons, but I am just starting out with my mom being diagnosed and I've gleaned a bit of info. From what I understand there are two types of tremors. One when you are active which is NOT parkinsons, and one when you are at rest which is Parkinsons. My mom has the parkinsons type. She also has the weird sensations of itchiness and exactly as you described it like things biting her. This, as I understand it, is from a form of dementia associated with Parkinsons called Lewy-Body dementia. I am not saying these are what you have, but they are familiar. I would go back to your neurologist with these new symptoms and ask for a reassessment and for information about Lewy-Body as it does present with parkinson's like symptoms.

I don't have anything about amino acid supplements other than I heard 5-HTP info is very limited with regards to PD. High protein can help as long as he takes the protein, like a whey shake, a little while after he takes the levodopa (protein taken before levodopa can block the body from properly absorbing the levodopa). But in terms of supplements, she takes Vitamin D, B6 and B12. I also have been reading that Zinc supplements can be beneficial for Parkinson's. She also started exercising almost daily.

It doesn't look like PD to me and here's why. One common distinction between PD and Essential Tremor (ET) is the type of tremor one experiences and when/how it shows up. There are two main types of tremor: (1) a resting tremor which is common in PD (meaning the tremor appears when body/body part is at rest), and (2) an action/kinetic tremor which is more prevalent in ET (meaning the tremor comes out when you are doing something that requires you to engage your muscles, liking reaching for something or holding your hand out as you are in your video). In your video, you demonstrate what's called a postural tremor, which is a type of kinetic tremor, meaning it's not likely a parkinsonian tremor (good news, but again I'm not a doctor). With that said, the postural tremor you show in your video may not be a result of ET. Postural tremors could be normal physiological tremors (we all vibrate, some people just vibrate more visably than others), or it could be the result of caffeine intake, withdrawal of some kind (alcohol/drugs), use of meds antidepressants, etc. Obviously, you'd need a doctor, preferably a neurologist, to confirm any of these things, and ideally you would see a movement disorders specialist (a specialized neurologist). If you have any nearby, it wouldn't hurt to call their office to explain your situation and see if it's possible that they could offer you a no-cost visit to discuss. They may agree to that, and I hope they do. Edit: I just re-read your post, and see that you still feel the tremor at rest and that you'll have insurance in a month. Still don't think it's PD, but I'm glad you'll be able to see a doctor soon to confirm and potentially treat whatever it is. I think the large amount of weight loss and now weight lifting is contributing to this as your body is going through big changes and any stressors can worsen tremors, even normal ones (by the way, congrats, that's an epic feat!).

I have Essential Tremors, also. For 15 years, the ET went under diagnosed and untreated, so by age 35 I was severe. I couldn't eat most meals on my own, needed supervision in the shower, couldn't write,.. etc. I then started to show some PD symptoms, resting tremor (ET is an action tremor) and trouble picking up my feet when walking. 2 years later I started meds for the ET, which worked, *mostly*. The remaining symptoms were taken care of with L-Dopa. A DatScan confirmed diagnosis. Now, at age 42 I'm mostly tremor free, can walk without trouble for the most part, can write... I've even started cross stitch just because I can thread needles now.

Something like a UTI can cause a blood infection, producing sudden changes. A friend with Parkinson's kept falling and bruising her knees. Her onset of confusion was rapid, mistaking her cell phone for her tv remote control. Blood infection due bruising/damage behind the knees. Took docs a while to sort that one out, once treated with antibiotics returned to normal. The biggest challenge is messing up on medication. Too much Sinemet, and you will induce schizophrenia issues. Do I take one pill every four hours, or four pills every hour?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4611719106891748435/Rowing-the-Indian-Ocean-with-Parkinson's	Rowing the Indian Ocean with Parkinson's	Good evening Reddit, So next month our team of 4 men from the UK will row 3600 miles across the Indian Ocean in aid of Parkinson's Disease, it will take around 65 days unsupported. 2 hours on, 2 hours off, non-stop. Robin, who's in the crew, was diagnosed a couple of years ago at the age of 43. We have Oxford Brookes University running tests on Robin and Billy (similar age, doesn't have PD) throughout the row to compare how they cope mentally and physically. As they'll both be doing the same amount of rowing and eating the same controlled diet it should be a fair test. They'll also be looking to see if the repetitive nature of rowing and the gained muscle memory will help Robin with his Parkinson's.

Silenor (Doxepin in 3mg or 6mg dose) is what I have been using. Typically I am out at 10 PM, but would wake up around 1 AM and never go back to sleep. It helps me drift back off to sleep.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4610662198265344472/question-about-dopamine:-overexertion-and-depression	question about dopamine: overexertion and depression	"I recently moved in with a relative with parkinsons (stage 3) to help out with housework, lawn maintenance, and whatever comes up as the disease progresses. I've been trying to identify what I'm looking at when I see him really down emotionally, be it depression, demoralization, or just meds. I'm flat out ruling out depression, because most days he's upbeat, laughing, and has no signs of loss of motivation or energy. No part of me doubts demoralization is in play though, just from talking with him. So I'm just trying to better understand the meds portion of this, and I think I noticed a trend: when he really overdoes it physically, I *think* those seem to be the days when he's at his lowest emotionally in-between doses and at night. So if I understand how parkinsons works, he more or less can't create his own dopamine, and gets his via levodopa which allows him to move. And as far as I know, dopamine also plays a big part into emotional states. So is this a thing? If you overexert yourself physically, can that cause you to ""use up"" the dopamine from the levodopa faster than if you weren't as active during that dose, leaving you in a rut emotionally until it's time for the next dose? I know a previous doctor at some point told him his active lifestyle is probably why his disease has progressed as slowly as it has (~12 years in), but I'm also pretty sure he said his current doctor keeps telling him he needs to exercise *less* and quit working, which might be related if this is how the dopamine works. I'll be heading to future doctor's appointments with him to be a bit more informed, but in the meantime I'd love some accounts from other people with first hand experience on this stuff. *EDIT: leaving this here for posterity's sake: this book on the sidebar is an absolute godsend for medication information: The New Parkinson's Disease Treatment Book (2015 Editon) by Ahlskog.

Commenting to follow because I'm in a similar situation. I'm an only child and my dad was recently diagnosed with early stage Parkinson's at age 63. He's a woodshop teacher, and I know he'll be devastated when the time comes that he can't do woodwork anymore. And I've had the same thought about him being afraid to hold my future children (I'm married but only 24, so that's down the line a few years). He began medication only a couple months ago, but he's very early stage, so we're hoping it really helps hold off the worst of the symptoms as long as it can. 	1	1	magickates|re|:|What's|the|best|way|to|support|a|parent|with|Parkinson|?

OxfordDictionary re: How bad is Parkinson's disease if you catch it early and receive treatment?	The one common thing in every patient with Parkinson's is that the part of their brain that produces dopamine isn't working right. That can cause a whole ton of symptoms, but every patient is affected differently--there's no way to tell ahead of time what symptoms your Dad will develop and how much they will affect him. So you're scaring yourself unnecessarily by looking at videos of people with PD--some patients never get a tremor. The videos you are seeing are late stage PD. It can take up to 20 years to get to that point. Chances are your dad will never reach that stage--he will most likely die of some normal age-related disease before he gets to that point. There is a ton of stuff your dad can do now to help keep the disease from progressing. ***Exercise is a better medicine than the actual PD medication.***. 	1	1	OxfordDictionary|re|:|How|bad|is|Parkinson's|disease|if|you|catch|it|early|and|receive|treatment|?

I keed it and a LIST ALL OF the MEDICATIONS I am taking. Take all the pill bottles with her for the intake to record. Make sure everything is correct. I also print about a dozen 8 x 11 bright fluorescent yellow or green signs with Hi, my name is PARKIE DUDE. I need my medications on time, Every time. Wake me! AWARE in Care kit Contents: http://parkinson.org/Living-with-Parkinsons/Resources-and-Support/Patient-Safety-Kit/Kit-Contents There are five of six items; I would print them out. Medication ALERT: http://parkinson.org/sites/default/files/P135-PF-002-E-MedicalAlertCard-20171101. pdf Print out a bunch of those and have them handy to hand out. Yes, some docs will question it as ""they never heard that."" Stand firm, be polite, but be your advocate. When I have tired my words badly slur, between that and tremor, I've had docs assume I was detoxing and comment ""damn alcoholics should drink themselves to death at home."" I made it clear I DO NOT DRINK, and I HAVE PARKINSONS. Fire that doctor, let them know they are not to come into the room. Period (lack of sleep, it was a resident who apologized, but learned a valuable lesson. One I don't put up with that BS, and never assume!). Hence once admitted to a room SIX pieces of paper, one on both sides of the door, one on each wall. Later a night RN admitted they were going to let me sleep, but I was so adamant about my meds they made sure I was awake and took them. The only time I was outraged, ICU. No bathroom? What do I mean I can not get out of bed to the bathroom! The compromise was they brought me a porta potty stool. Oh, fun. The other was to ""keep ahead of your pain."" Sigh, I have horrible constipation. Opioids shut me down. History of stomach ulcers, so no aspirin. Not much I can take, but that is normal for me. So I tell them no painkillers. No, I'm not a macho guy, but would instead do meditation or mental exercise. OK, enough rambles for me. If you are close by, the best thing is to is check in on her. Staff is aware when a family is visiting. Put up those signs; it helps with ""Hi, my name is..... "" to remind staff you are a person with Parkinson's. Oh, one thing I did was keep a notebook. When docs came into the room noted date/time, which the doc or nurse was, and quick comments. Helped with boredom, and later I could look at notes to remember what they discovered and next course of action. This lets the patient sleep, and often they will ask the same question. Be patient as the effects of anesthesia mean things are a little foggy. Oh, I used to take my pillow, blanket, and universal TV remote. Granola or Energy bars for you. Lots of water, keep your fluids up. The one on the bed could only change channels ""up,"" so if you are on channel 89 and want 87, you have to hit the up button almost 90 times. That drove me crazy as I would miss one too many! I wish you and your aunt the best.

What a statement! Or maybe your symptoms are just under control from whatever therapy you’re on. Please be careful how you describe your dealing with PD. Total recovery means you’ve been cured and as we all know there is no such thing. Were that the case there would be no Michael J Fox Foundation, no one would be suffering the pain and trauma of PD and of course we wouldn’t be on this subreddit. I myself am on Stelevo (carba leva entacapne) and Mirapex (Pramipexole) plus a few others. Except for an occasional adjustment, they work. Add to that some weightlifting cardio diet control and the great support I get from my family and others most of my symptoms have abated. I have had PD going on 10 years (soon to be 65) and it took a while to gain control but I am not fooling my self. PD will at some point take over. But until then I am enjoying life. While I’m happy yours is under control your statement can have serious implications and give false hope to others.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4600552003530234276/HudsonSir-re:-Not-diagnosed,-suffering-and-disabled	HudsonSir re: Not diagnosed, suffering and disabled	I have one family member with PD and three with IC, so hopefully I can be of some help. But it sounds like you have a lot going on, so I’m sure it’s hard managing and coordinating all of your care. In terms of IC, my family members are on a host of medications and each swear by different ones for different reasons (singulair, elmiron, aloe etc.) but all of them agree the #1 thing that helped was heavily restricting their diet. That meant no herbs, spices (inc. pepper), citrus, caffeine, alcohol and a whole lot more. It varies for each person, and once you get things under control you can sometimes start adding things back in. You may be doing this already, if so I’m sorry, but if not I highly recommend working with your urologist to get that going. I also know the IC Network is very useful and supportive. They have active message boards and can really help you navigate things with first hand advice. Definitely join up if you haven’t already. Having multiple things going on is tough. Doctors sometimes fall into the bad habit of blaming an unexplained symptom on whatever disease is not their area of expertise. I’ve seen it happen a lot with my wife. My suggestion is to keep trying doctors until you find one who listens and will try to treat all of you, that is to say - takes your other diagnoses into consideration. Easier said than done, I know.

His Dr is right. This is a specific type of movement disorder called athetosis, which effects only the tongue and/or fingers. It's often seen with chorea (choreoathetosis) which is less common than dyskinesia in PD, but a related symptom in that all of these movement disorders stem from the basal ganglia.

Many other with Parkinson's who remain active had product lives for twenty or thirty more years. Key is that physically and mentally active.

I noticed a vibration in right foot and then right hand. After about 18 months a shake and/or tremor. Twelve months later, shaking. My neurologist. Started me on entacapone,levodopa, carbidopa, and pramipexole to reduce symptoms and slow down progression but I could not tolerate them for long due to severe side effects. I decided to adopt a more natural approach and started on Parkinson’s Disease Herbal formula from Green House Herbal Clinic, the PD natural formula immensely helped my condition, i had a total recovery from Parkinson’s disease with this natural herbal formula treatment. Visit Green House Herbal Clinic official web site ww w. greenhouseherbalclinic. Weebly. com. I feel alive again! The tremors, Shaking, Joint Stiffness and other symptoms has subsided. I am very pleased with this treatment. I feel very well now and exercise regularly, sometimes i totally forget i ever had Parkinson’s, My family are amazed at the change and rapid recovery from PD. since the procedure I enjoy walking the dog for my daily exercise.

About 75% of my symptoms are more in the dystonia category . Dystonia is often the first symptom of PD in young people. There are many forms of dystonia depending on location including generalized which is whole body but generally dystonia that is one sided will not progress to the other. I only have dystonia symptoms on my left side and are mainly in my arm, shoulder and neck. Most YOPD people I know have foot dystonia. I have very mild PD symptoms on my right side but no dystonia. The tremor is more spastic with dystonia and more rhythmic with PD. I have had both types of tremors. I was first thought to just have primary hemidystonia.

On levodopa/carbidopa 25/100 (Sinemet). Plus ropinirole (Requip) for restless legs and to work with the Sinemet. Also rasagiline (Azilect). My new neurologist was upset that my previous neurologist hadn't increased my Sinemet because my tremors had gotten worse.

AlfredJFuzzywinkle re: Could Dental Surgery (Root Canal) led to early Parkinsons?	You need better doctors. There is no benefit to delaying the medication, although some doctors still will tell you otherwise because they haven’t kept up with current research. The reason she has more tremors now then previously is that the disease is progressing. This is hidden by the medication, not caused by it! If she wants to slow the progression of the disease do the following: 1. Eliminate dairy products of any kind from the diet. 2. Stop consuming pork or red meat. No more fried foods. No more alcohol. 3. Avoid protein early in the day, within reason 4. Work up to getting 60 minutes of intense cardio exercise 3 times a week. As far as a root canal, I have no idea. Research research indicates that there is a link between gut bacteria, constipation and the onset of Parkinson’s. Keep in mind that symptoms of Parkinson’s may not be apparent for many years even as the disease progresses. 	1	1	AlfredJFuzzywinkle|re|:|Could|Dental|Surgery|(|Root|Canal|)|led|to|early|Parkinsons|?

I have a tremor like this when I lift my thumbs too. It’s been there since at least elementary school and has not progressed beyond that in 20+ years.

Fingers tend to twitch in a ""side to side"" motion - Nothing happens at rest (no tremor). Except the occasional single/double twitch (but even thats rare) - im a 32/Male Does this look like a PD tremor?

Will a 23 and me genetic test show if I have early onset parkinsons?	Neuro says my symptoms are there but not measurable. At this moment he has to say im fine. But in the future he may not. As things become measurable. In the mean time I have POTS and Possibly something else. Another doc thinks my excessive thirst is a symptom of CONNS syndrom. Waiting on the test for that. So i was reading that pretty much a genetic test is the only way to figure it out because eopd is alwaya genetic. I have no desire to go in and beg doctors for this. Because a diagnosis today isn't that important. But I'm also not crazy about the idea of deteriorating to the point of getting meds to finally slow progression. Seems counter productive. My question comes from a post I saw some where. The guy had done the 23 and me test and was simply asking how to avoid getting it or something. The 23 and me tests 2 variants in the lrrk2 and gba genes. Now. This will not cover all the PARK and PINk variants. I understand gettimg this test does not mean I have it. And even if the test comes up negative, it doesn't mean I don't have it. Am I correct on this?

Every person is different, but there is some great research out there about exercise and Parkinson's. The key seems to be the higher the intensity the better. For many people exercise can slow the progression and reverse some symptoms to an extent (though I believe exercise+meds is considered the best option). I would recommend getting your mom into a physical therapist with experience with PD, to get started. The PT specialty is called LVST, but there are great PTs who aren't LVST certified. Unfortunately, the non-motor symptoms are usually harder to treat than the motor symptoms, and exercise mostly treats the motor symptoms. At this point, it seems that only meds really help with non motor. 	1	1	notthefakehigh|5r|re|:|Outside|of|medication|,|what|do|you|do|to|help|your|symptoms|?

In Private: I can not lay in bed and cuddle next to my wife. When I am still like that the Peripheral Neuropathy kicks in. It isn't Parkinsons, but other things that are happening. My best way to remain at peace is to be mentally engaged in doing something. Otherwise, I need to pace the hallway.

Hi folks - I am just now really learning more about my MiL’s PD as she’s moved from her house into a fantastic facility close to us with 24 hour therapy and nursing care. She’s having a terrible time with nausea and vomiting - we’d attributed it to stress previously, but it keeps coming up (no pun intended). It comes on fast, like one minute she’s fine, two hours later she’s in an ambulance (dehydration even after Zofran). The articles I’ve found all mention constipation as a common non-motor symptom - anybody out there also suffering from the opposite? Have you found a way to curb it? We’re having a time finding a new PCP for her, so in the meantime I’m open to find out anything I can that might help her out a bit. Thanks all! 	1	1	GI|issues|?

It's criminal knowing what I know, having the product that I have and not being able to help the sick.

I have Parkinson’s and first of all, thank you for applying your talents to helping people like me! Suggestions: make your device non-attention getting. Having Parkinson’s can get me fired! So I am only going to use products that are not obviously Parkinson’s only. A couple of possible ideas: I am frustrated by my inability to use my computer mouse when my hand has tremors. Possibly a different shape or design could really help? Possible a built in gyroscope to stabilize it? Another item that would help would be a watch that pulses when it’s time to take my medication. I do well when I take my meds at 4 hour intervals but traveling upends my schedule sometimes and if my medication wears off completely then it can be embarrassing or even dangerous. This might be a Apple Watch app, but it would be great if there was a simple automated process where I just tap it once when I take my Meds and then an silent alarm goes off when it’s time for the next dose. Even better would be an app that monitors my symptoms and displays results a week, a month a year at a time. Finally there is an interesting research effort you should tap into. Google the terms “positive deviance” and Parkinson’s. This should take you to a study where researchers are tracking thousands of PD patients and trying to sort out what factors such as dietary restrictions or exercises slow progression of PD. You could find that your design skills would be very valuable in this context, perhaps collaboratively? 	1	1	AlfredJFuzzywinkle|re|:|Excercises|for|parkinson|pacients|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4588022860455785352/I-need-to-vent.	I need to vent.	"So I have to get this off my chest. To people who might have some thing important to say. Because I'm kind of a mess right now. And I feel crazy. So I have every symptom of early onset parkinsons. EVERY SYMPTOM. It doesn't matter what website I am reading on, what info, what any thing. I HAVE ANY THING THEY LIST. Which I totally get could be any number of things, and going into this i was not dead set that I have eopd. Just that it fit more than any thing. I've looked at a lot of other illnesses. SO MY FIRST ""NEuRUO"". I drove 6 hours one way with two almost two year olds. She was not an neurologist. She was a nurse practitioner. Who has zero neuro specific certs. I had made a list of symptoms. Because, I had to wait two months and drive half a day. So I sit down and it's a fucking witch hunt. I say, ""the first time I showed symptoms of POTS I was x age, but it went away"" She just about yells at me, ""You don't have POTS"". ok... I never said I did. she continues, ""does your heart race?"" I said, I don't know, let me see. And I kneel down. ""what are you doing get up"" she says. I say I was trying to find out if my heart raced when I blacked out (because it happens almost every time I stand). SHe tells me I am being ridiculous and to get off the ground. So I slide into my chair, because I don't trust this fucking woman to catch me if I fall. She continues, by chewing me out for using the words ""blacking out"". She seriously had an issue with every single term I had for ten minutes. Including contradicting herself just to fight with me. She tells me that since I've never actually fallen from it that I have managed it just fine. Yeah, laying on the bathroom floor and holding myself against walls or my husband until I can SEE again while parenting three kids is totally managed. I might add I am very timid. So I wasn't arguing back. I was trying desperately to appease her so that she would listen to me. Moving on. She tediously writes every thing down. Finally when I am about half way through my list she says, ""it sounds like you think you have a lot of things wrong with you."" I explain, no, I had a list of symptoms, I'm at the doctor, and I was explaining things that have just started.. She then gives me the standard normal parkinsons test. I don't have weakness on one side. I don't shuffle my feet. I'm not always suffering a balance issue, but some times am. EOPD doesn't usually present with this. She then tells me that I show zero symptoms of parkinsons. I tell her that I literally just read a list of EOPD symptoms. I tell her my hands are numb and she ignores me. I ask what am I supposed to do about the new cognitive issues. She tells me to get a second opinion and go to speech therapy. Mind you she isn't offering me a referral for it. Or even offering to help me find it. She just keeps telling me to get another opinion. that it isn't her problem. and that speech therapy should be enough for ""my sudden cognitive issues"". She then started asking me what kind of drugs I used. didn't believe I didn't smoke pot. and didn't believe I didn't drink. I have a facial piercing. so I'm assuming she was profiling me. She would not even look at my list a second time. She would no look for anything it might be that is going on. (you know because all the hard drug users are seeking ladopa) After this horrible interaction she asked to come out to the waiting room and see my babies. ... Seriously. So the next morining I call the hospital and talk to them and they get me into see the real neurologist. He was wonderful. Because of the earlier interaction, I was terrified of speaking. So I made a list. with when the symptom started. He really liked that. I said I kind of ramble and I think it might have been part of the issue yesterday. He did quite a bit more. But it was still the standard test. Our entire state doesn't have any means of doing a more advanced test. (datscan) I might add, he used the words ""black out"" to describe when I was losing my sight and falling over. He (with out me saying any thing) said I definitely had POTS and carried on and on about how hard it is to diagnose (which the NP said the opposite). It should be easy to diagnose with me because it happens almost every time I stand up. He said he thought I had carpal tunnel. He did a little test with a metal hammer, but nothing fancy. At the time my pinky finger was unaffected. But that was just then. I mentioned that. But he was pretty sure it was carpal tunnel. I don't recall if I pushed onset, or both hands. He addressed my tremors, which she refused to do. He said I had a pathologic tremor that was turning into an essential tremor, that was probably on the verge of needing to be medicated ( I cut myself 4 times last week). He actually listened to me when I said my thumb had a different type of tremor. He said, if he could see every thing on my list, he would have a different opinion. But he can't diagnose what he can't see. He felt like the thumb tremor was probably the start of a parkinsons tremor ( I showed it to him by moving my thumb with my other hand haha). and that if he could see every thing we might be talking about an EOPD med. But for now, we are saying I don't have it. And waiting till it becomes measurable. Same with the confusion. I was too articulate for him to notice any thing wrong. It comes and goes. He then asked me about what happened the day before and told me the woman was new. I was not the first to complain. She sounded horrible. And couldn't believe how fucking awkward it must have been to have been so upset and showing this woman my kids. . and it was. it felt good to hear it. He validated me. but he gave me very few answers. I've been researching POTS and assuming that getting it treated will at least make me significantly less miserable. I was more than surprised it caused so many other problems. I've been asking friends, and the reddits about carpal tunnel. because I'm just not sure it's whats wrong. Peripheral neuropathy is a symptom of genetic parkinsons. and in order for it to fit my symptoms I would have had to get carpal tunel x2 and cubital tunnel x2 exactly at the same time. it doesn't explain that I get pressure behind my eyes when the sensations get stronger. and that I have the same sensation in my feet. That said. I am 100 % willing to go to the doc tomorrow and talk about treating the carpal tunnel and pots. Though I will express my concern that it is not carpal tunnel. In the last two weeks the hand and foot numbness has gone from none (except when I was about to fall asleep) to pretty unbearable almost all the time. I'm talking to my husband about getting a green card. Because If I literally have to sit around and wait for this to get worse, I at least want to be less miserable. I really really am hoping treating the pots will help though. I'm just kind of ... bleh.. bleh because I have no real answers about every thing. Neither of them were willing to look past my idea of EOPD. I didn't want them to be blinded by my idea. I figured they would say, ""No way it's EOPD!!! BUt you do have!"" .. but he covered two symptoms and then didn't know. haha.. ugh!! ugh... thanks for reading. if you did. "	1	1	I|need|to|vent|.

I struggled with a few words, but hopefully readable -- ParkieDude Parkinsons: Bent, not broken The number of Parkinson's patients is increasing dramatically. Is the medicine prepared for this? ""I'll see if she's still there,"" says Aren Hilb * and shuffles to the bathroom. Door open, light on, door closed, wide smile: ""No, she's gone."" Since Hilb got the drug Levodopa for Parkinson's, he sometimes sees things that are not there. For example, the girl in the bathroom. ""She's nice; she does not bother me."" Hilb's right hand trembles. When he sits, she claps rhythmically on her thigh. His gait: a little bent, his right leg stiff. ""Sometimes I want to move my leg, but nothing happens,"" says Hilb. ""It's like the brain sending signals that do not arrive at the leg."" In fact, the problem lies in the so-called idiopathic Parkinson's syndrome, in which Hilb is also suffering, in the brain itself. Nerve cells, which play a central role in the movement, died in the midbrain. These neurons produce the messenger substance dopamine and send it with their slender nerve endings into areas below the cerebral cortex, which regulate movements, motivation, but also cognitive processes. When about half of these cells have disappeared, the symptoms are typical: arms and legs begin to tremble even when the patient is calm, with one side of the body more affected. The muscles become stiff, the steps smaller - it becomes increasingly difficult to perform movements; The facial expression becomes rigid, and patients fall more easily. It is becoming increasingly important to understand the disease even better. For Parkinson's has become a veritable pandemic, wrote recently the US neurology professor Ray Dorsey of the University of Rochester in the journal Jama Neurology. ""In the last 25 years, the number of diseases worldwide has doubled,"" he explains the TIME. ""And by 2040, it could double again, to over 14 million people."" Germany is not exempt from this, says Günther Deuschl, a neurologist at Christians-Albrechts University in Kiel and president of the European Academy of Neurology: ""Parkinson's numbers are on the increase."" Currently, 250,000 to 300,000 people in Germany are living with the disease further increase is to be expected. "" According to yet unreported health insurance data, it could even be up to 400,000. What is the reason that the numbers are rising so rapidly? And is medicine prepared to recognize and treat the many new patients? At Aren Hilb, the disease first became apparent two years ago. His hands became weaker, restless legs kept him from sleeping, and then the shaking began-especially when he was excited. In August of last year, the illness forced him to give up his job as team leader of an inventory company. He still remembers the day accurately: ""My hands were weak, when I drove home, I was unable to complete the trip because the tremors were so strong."" He rode right, called the police and asked the officials to park the car. Then Hilb went home. Aren Hilb was 55 when Parkinson's was diagnosed with him. Most of the time, however, the disease only gets worse later. On average, every one of the over 65s suffers from Parkinson's disease, and those over 85 are even up to three percent ill. ""The main risk factor for Parkinson's is old age,"" explains Deuschl. So it is clear that Parkinson's increases when people in Germany and the world get older and older. But that, as Ray Dorsey notes, is not the only reason. Because the rates of Parkinson's are increasing more rapidly than, for example, those of Alzheimer's dementia, also a typical old-age disease. Why - this is still in the dark, although there are suspects: ""Probably environmental factors play an important role,"" says Dorsey. Especially pesticides are suspected. And then, paradoxically, the decline in cigarette consumption is probably to blame: ""Smokers only develop Parkinson's half as often,"" says Dorsey. That in Western Europe and the US smokers are less could so Parkinson's advance. ""But we would never recommend smoking,"" says Günther Deuschl. Instead, studies are underway to determine whether nicotine patches can prevent the onset of the disease. ""A vaccine would be a gigantic step forward."" In general, Dorsey and Deuschl agree that it finally needs therapies that prevent the disease, delay its onset or weaken the course. This is the only way to slow down the trend of the pandemic. The previous drugs are purely symptomatic. The best known of these is levodopa, a precursor of dopamine. It is intended to compensate for the lack of the messenger substance and thus reduce movement disability and trembling. Levodopa has been on the market since the sixties, with other classes soon followed - all safe and effective. But since the 1970s, little has been done in drug therapy. Although a vaccine against the clumping protein alpha-synuclein has been tested for some time (see box). ""A vaccine would be a huge step forward,"" says Ray Dorsey. But nobody knows when this prevention will come. At the moment, everything goes beyond the therapy of the patients. The last breakthrough in treatment is almost 30 years ago. In 1987, says Christian Moll, neurologists from the University of Grenoble implanted an electrode into the brain of a Parkinson's patient for the first time. Moll is a neurophysiologist at the Center for Experimental Medicine at the University of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE). He has been researching and working for years with this technique called deep brain stimulation. The failure of the dopamine-producing nerve cells causes the system to lose its balance of movement. Suddenly nerve cells, which were not supposed to do that, rhythmically fired signals. The dither frequency in the arms and legs of the patients corresponds to the rate of this interference. ""With the flow of electrodes that we place in certain places in the brain, we want to suppress or overwrite this disruptive fire,"" explains Moll. The results are breathtaking for many patients. Some of those who barely managed to lift their feet off the ground and put one foot back in front of the other suddenly start to make fluid movements again. And the fine motor skills come back in many patients. And yet some are disappointed. ""But the promise is not that the patient will be fine forever,"" emphasizes Moll. ""We just put the clock back a couple of years, and in the background, the disease continues."" For a long time, deep brain stimulation was the last resort for patients for whom all other therapies did not work. In the meantime, however, it is well known that it makes sense to provide patients with it earlier, namely when the first problems occur with medication. ""We now know that deep brain stimulation gives the patient years of life and significantly improves their quality of life,"" says Deuschl. He has published a study in the journal New England Journal of Medicine. Also for Aren Hilb the deep brain stimulation could soon come into question: Under the therapy with levodopa, it comes since last summer to difficulties, about to hallucinations. Hilb wants to find out about the risks and opportunities in the UKE. To develop deep brain stimulation or even new therapies, it takes money. With patient numbers rising, Dorsey believes that there is still too little funding available for research, with Parkinson's being the ""most disabling and fatal disease of all neurological diseases."" In the United States, he estimates, half as many patients have Parkinson's disease like HIV, but only one-tenth of the money would flow into the research. For Europe and Germany, such data are difficult to determine. There is another problem: Worldwide, only a fraction of Parkinson's patients receive adequate medical care. Dorsey finds this ""unscrupulous,"" especially since there are patent-free and cheap drugs. In the United States, 40 percent of patients are not treated by a neurologist, which significantly worsens their treatment. That every Parkinson's patient always goes to the neurologist, says Deuschl, is unrealistic at the moment. ""But what's important now is for a neurologist to see patients at all critical stages of disease development, such as diagnosis and whenever there are problems with treatment."" To regulate how family doctors and neurologists should work together, he wants a binding National Care Guideline. The many new patients would help enormously. * Name changed at the request of the patient.

"Sure. I did a very (very) brief read on one theory of how PD works and it involves abnormal activity in the thalamus. this is significant to TM since the deepest point during TM is called _samadhi_ or pure consciousness, where the brain seems temporarily unable to process either incoming data OR ongoing thalamocortical feedback loops between the cortex and the thalamus. This is ""experienced"" as a period of ""no experience"" even though the person doesn't seem to have fallen asleep. That Fox gets temporary relief from an abnormally-firing thalamus after practicing something that can temporarily suspend ANY firing from certain parts of the thalamus is not that surprising. What is interesting is that his relief seems to persist for a moment after meditation is over and that the effect from TM continues, even as his disease progresses, or so Fox's quote for the book suggests: [“I can’t say enough about Bob Roth and Transcendental Meditation. Stillness, true stillness, of both mind and body, is a gift. TM taught me how to access that stillness and open that gift every single day.”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1501161210?_encoding=UTF8&isInIframe=0&n=283155&ref_=dp_proddesc_0&s=books&showDetailProductDesc=1#product-description_feature_div).

Fox, is a Canadian-American actor, author, comedian, producer, and activist. With a film and television career spanning from the 1970s, Fox starred in the Back to the Future trilogy, where he portrayed Marty McFly. Other notable roles have included Mike Flaherty on the ABC sitcom Spin City (1996–2000), for which he won five Emmys, four Golden Globes, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards and his portrayal of Alex P.

[Excerpt on teaching Michael J Fox] . _I have been teaching people to meditate for a very long time, but I always appreciate seeing the unique way it affects different people. Case in point: when I had the opportunity to teach actor Michael J Fox. It started when I got a call during half-time while I was attending a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden._ _It was Tracy Pollan, Michael’s wife. She wanted to set up a time for Michael to learn to meditate. As we were hammering out dates, I discussed some of the benefits that the meditation could bring to Michael, who I knew had been battling Parkinson’s disease since the early Nineties. At the end of the conversation I asked Tracy offhandedly: “Is Michael looking forward to learning?”_ _“Oh, God, he doesn’t know,” she said with a laugh. “I haven’t told him yet — it’s a surprise!”_ _Michael must have liked the surprise because he came to our office several weeks later to learn. Before we began, he told me he had not taken any of his medications that day that help to control his tremors. He wanted to see objectively the degree to which meditating calmed him down. Michael on tremor-reducing meds is how you see him on television and in public spaces._ _Michael off meds is how almost no one sees him, save for his family and closest friends. In fact, after decades with PD, as many people with Parkinson’s call it, Michael’s tremors had become more pronounced. I sat across from Michael in my office, both of us in comfortable chairs. I gave him his mantra and explained how to use it properly. He closed his eyes and began to meditate. Within seconds — literally seconds — all his tremors ceased. I am not talking gradually subsided, but just stopped. Stunned by what I saw, I closed my eyes and meditated with him. A few minutes later, when we both were done meditating, I looked over at him, and he was staring at his hands, which lay motionless on his lap. He sat like that for several more minutes, just looking at his hands._ _“This moment,” he said, “is the calmest I have felt in years. Decades.”_ _I wondered if he would have the same experience the next time he meditated at home. We met the following day and, sure enough, he said the same thing happened._ _A week later he told me it was still happening when he meditated at home. Whenever he did TM [transcendental meditation], the tremors ceased. He said he had begun sleeping more soundly through the night whereas before he would wake up every one or two hours._ _A month later, in another visit, Michael recalled how uncharacteristically relaxed he felt immediately prior to delivering an hour-long talk on Parkinson’s before a large audience in Toronto. In the past, he confided, he would have sat backstage, fretting anxiously over every word he planned to say. This time he meditated for 20 minutes in the green room, walked out on stage, and gave one of the best talks of his life._ _Although Michael’s tremors do inevitably return after he finishes his 20-minute meditation, for him the big thing has been the significant reduction in anxiety levels and the dramatic overall improvement in his quality of life._ . -**from _Strength in Stillness: The Power of Transcendental Meditation_** -Bob Roth . The Michael J Fox Foundation and the David Lynch Foundation have been [doing fund-raising to do research to see if this is a fluke or if TM really does have such an effect on people with PD.](http://pages.s7.exacttarget.com/Share.aspx?i=609bfa8aa54fad22baa5504d8afc0dc11b12756d790f8dbc). 	1	1	Bob|Roth|,|executive|director|of|the|David|Lynch|Foundation|,|has|a|new|book|out|.

I'm in my mid-20s and I live in a different city, and work quite hard so only see them periodically. My dad's been suffering particularly the last few months, and my mum's taking fantastic care of him, and being there for him in a way that I know he wouldn't want anyone else to be. He's a very private and stoic person. Obviously, I want to help him in any way I can, but I also really want to support her as she's looking after him, to keep her feeling good. We gave her a spa day for Christmas, and I periodically drop her texts to tell her how fantastic she is, but I wonder if there's anything else I can be doing? Small gifts, or suggestions for things that would be good for her, maybe?
