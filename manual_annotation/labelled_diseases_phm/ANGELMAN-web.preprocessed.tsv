medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4603601662078930694/You-Don't-Say	You Don't Say	She will get there in her own time. February 8, 2019 by Mary1991 1 Comment. For the last twelve months, I've not kept up with this blog. In my defense, I had been asked to write a weekly column about Jessie's life with Angelman Syndrome . I'm amazed that I was able to complete a year but I'm finding, at this stage, I don't have as much to share as I once did. There was no Facebook when Jess was born and there was no such thing as blogging. There were so many challenges, I wouldn't have run out of things to say so quickly! Not until Jess turned 13 did we learn her true diagnosis. Even so, it was another seven years before I found other Angelman parents and realized there was a community, All that time, I felt as though we were forging the road alone. I followed the lead of her teachers and doctors under the belief they knew what to do because they were the experts. I was just an overwhelmed mother who had no idea how to help other than take Jess to any and all therapy that we thought would break the spell. Long ago I learned about auditory learners, visual learners and people like me who needed to be hands on. Jessie had a smidgen of all the above but not enough of each style for her to make much progress. Couple that with being non-verbal, we had no idea what she was thinking much less understanding. Sure, as a mom, we get pretty good at anticipating needs but this is far from having the ability to read a person's mind. To add to Jessie's complex learning style, there was a complete disconnection with motor planning. Though I could see that she knew what belonged together and what was needed to make something work, she had no ability to get her eyes and hands to work together to make it happen. No one recognized that her depth perception was severely compromised (due to her right eye drifting, it should have been obvious to the trained eye, no pun intended. If you asked her to tap a picture of an apple, she tapped a photo of a puppy instead, it was assumed she hadn't a clue what you were talking about. Being that hindsight is 20/20, she didn't have the eye-hand coordination to touch the apple (but touched every picture around it in a perfect circle, yet again, this should have been an obvious clue) and so ended up touching something that interested her. Oh, how frustrating those “old days” were. However, today is a new day and we have resolved many of the barriers that held her back from learning. Though Jess isn't a typical 20-something, we are witnessing her grow into a unique and lovely young woman. Though this isn't the life I would have chosen, I am grateful for what I've learned because of her. When there isn't a road, you need to make your own. Don't fall into the trap and let others predict your child's fate. For us, we had to break away and go rogue . If something isn't working, it's crazy to keep thinking that doing the same thing over and over is going to change the outcome. I know that has been said so many times before but it is so very true. I wish I could say I'm working daily on her independence, however, my effort is better compared to a roller coaster. There are days we work diligently and then there are days we coast. Twists and turns can be scary, however, more times than not, we find ourselves coasting in at days end with little drama, ready to begin the next day with joyful anticipation. Though Jess has (and will always have) a long way to go, we are pleased with the progress she has made. She has transitioned to where she helps me more than makes me work. No longer does she resent me for asking more of her and the end result is we both have more freedom to pursue what makes us happy. It's odd to say but I feel blessed that Jess has been my teacher. Hopefully, she feels the same way. Sometimes Mama needs rest and sometimes she needs a cocktail but most of all, we moms should not be too hard on ourselves. There's always more to do than time. Some days we are able to cross out items on the todo list, and other days we find ourselves going nowhere fast. As Scarlett O'Hara said, “Tomorrow is another day”. It doesn't matter how long it takes her to get there, she will in her own time. PS- I don't really know where “there” is, I can't see around the bend but as she needs me less, I feel as though we are getting closer to our destination.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4679917507794033330/Genetic-therapy-may-help-children-with-Angelman-syndrome-to-overcome-seizures	Genetic therapy may help children with Angelman syndrome to overcome seizures	"Reviewed by James Ives, MPsych Nov 21 2018. Angelman syndrome is a genetic disease with no cure. Children grow up with severe intellectual disabilities and a range of other problems, arguably the worst of which are epileptic seizures. Now scientists at the UNC School of Medicine have found evidence that genetic therapy may prevent the enhanced seizure susceptibility. Published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , the research marks the first time scientists were able to reduce seizure susceptibility in mice by activating a dormant copy of the UBE3A gene so it could replace the faulty mutant version. While replacing the faulty gene in juveniles reduced seizures, replacing the faulty gene in adult mice had no effect. The UNC scientists also found evidence that the loss of this gene in Angelman syndrome promotes seizures by impairing the normal activity of inhibitory neurons - cells that normally keep brain circuits from being overstimulated. ""These findings should be very useful in the development and testing of therapies for Angelman syndrome,"" said senior author Benjamin D. Philpot, PhD, Kenan Distinguished Professor in the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, associate director of the UNC Neuroscience Center, and member of the UNC Autism Research Center. Angelman syndrome, named for the pediatrician who first described it in 1965, afflicts roughly one in 20,000 people, which implies that there are more than 16,000 people with the syndrome in the United States alone. The syndrome is caused by the loss of function of a single gene, UBE3A, but with an odd twist: the mutant or deleted copy of UBE3A is the one inherited from the patient's mother. This maternal copy is crucial in neurons because - for reasons still unknown - the paternal copy of UBE3A is silenced in these cells via a mechanism called genomic imprinting. UBE3A encodes a protein that works in an important cellular waste-disposal and gene-regulating system. Precisely how the absence of this protein in neurons causes Angelman syndrome has never been clear. Even so, scientists have been working on candidate therapies to restore UBE3A activity in neurons, thereby preventing or reversing some or all of the features of the disease. Among these features is epilepsy, which afflicts about 90 percent of Angelman syndrome patients, who typically do not respond well to standard anti-seizure medications. Some aspects of the disease reflect abnormal prenatal and early postnatal development, and may never be reversible with treatments that start years after birth. But epilepsy often doesn't start in Angelman patients until age 2 or 3, suggesting that early life replacement of UBE3A might cure it or prevent it. Philpot and colleagues decided to investigate how early the gene reinstatement needed to take place. They took advantage of an Angelman syndrome mouse model, in which researchers inserted a working copy of the UBE3A gene that would lie dormant in brain cells until scientists turned it on with a chemical switch. Related Stories. The scientists found that switching on UBE3A failed to prevent or reverse the high susceptibility to seizures in adult Angelman mice. However, switching on the gene when the mice were just three weeks old made them as resistant to seizures as ordinary mice. ""Three weeks of age for a mouse corresponds to early childhood for a human, so this suggests that there may be a window of opportunity in childhood for the prevention of Angelman syndrome epilepsy,"" said first author Bin Gu, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the Philpot Lab who performed most of the key experiments. Another big question for Angelman syndrome researchers has to do with the neurons affected by the disease. Philpot wondered, to treat the condition successfully, would UBE3A activity need to be restored in all types of neurons or just in some? Philpot's team removed functional UBE3A from excitatory neurons - which trigger activity in connected neurons - and observed that the resulting mice were unaffected. Then they blocked the gene just in inhibitory neurons, whose activity normally quiets and regulates connected neurons, thereby preventing the neural hyperactivity that can trigger seizures. With UBE3A gone from the inhibitory neurons, the mice became even more susceptible to seizures than if UBE3A were absent from all neurons. ""This result implies that if you want to limit epilepsy in Angelman syndrome, you'll need at least to restore the function of UBE3A in inhibitory neurons,"" Philpot said. The researchers gained another clue to the mechanism of Angelman syndrome seizures when they examined the brains of the seizure-prone mice, particularly in an area of the brain known as the hippocampus. They detected an abnormal accumulation of perineuronal nets (PNNs) - structures that surround neurons and block them from making new connections. Abnormal PNN formation has previously been linked to seizures. The scientists found that the abnormal PNN deposition did not occur in the young mice where UBE3A activity had been restored. ""We can now think of these abnormal PNNs as biomarkers for enhanced seizure susceptibility,"" Philpot said. ""We now want to determine if these structures actually cause seizure susceptibility, for example by disrupting the connections that inhibitory neurons normally would make in this brain region."" Philpot and collaborators at UNC, along with other researchers elsewhere, are working on potential Angelman syndrome treatments, including drugs that would activate the previously silenced paternal copy of UBE3A in brain cells.

"CHAPEL HILL, NC - Angelman syndrome is a genetic disease with no cure. Children grow up with severe intellectual disabilities and a range of other problems, arguably the worst of which are epileptic seizures. Now scientists at the UNC School of Medicine have found evidence that genetic therapy may prevent the enhanced seizure susceptibility. Published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , the research marks the first time scientists were able to reduce seizure susceptibility in mice by activating a dormant copy of the UBE3A gene so it could replace the faulty mutant version. While replacing the faulty gene in juveniles reduced seizures, replacing the faulty gene in adult mice had no effect. The UNC scientists also found evidence that the loss of this gene in Angelman syndrome promotes seizures by impairing the normal activity of inhibitory neurons - cells that normally keep brain circuits from being overstimulated. ""These findings should be very useful in the development and testing of therapies for Angelman syndrome,"" said senior author Benjamin D. Philpot, PhD, Kenan Distinguished Professor in the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, associate director of the UNC Neuroscience Center, and member of the UNC Autism Research Center. Angelman syndrome, named for the pediatrician who first described it in 1965, afflicts roughly one in 20,000 people, which implies that there are more than 16,000 people with the syndrome in the United States alone. The syndrome is caused by the loss of function of a single gene, UBE3A, but with an odd twist: the mutant or deleted copy of UBE3A is the one inherited from the patient's mother. This maternal copy is crucial in neurons because - for reasons still unknown - the paternal copy of UBE3A is silenced in these cells via a mechanism called genomic imprinting. UBE3A encodes a protein that works in an important cellular waste-disposal and gene-regulating system. Precisely how the absence of this protein in neurons causes Angelman syndrome has never been clear. Even so, scientists have been working on candidate therapies to restore UBE3A activity in neurons, thereby preventing or reversing some or all of the features of the disease. Among these features is epilepsy, which afflicts about 90 percent of Angelman syndrome patients, who typically do not respond well to standard anti-seizure medications. Some aspects of the disease reflect abnormal prenatal and early postnatal development, and may never be reversible with treatments that start years after birth. But epilepsy often doesn't start in Angelman patients until age 2 or 3, suggesting that early life replacement of UBE3A might cure it or prevent it. Philpot and colleagues decided to investigate how early the gene reinstatement needed to take place. They took advantage of an Angelman syndrome mouse model, in which researchers inserted a working copy of the UBE3A gene that would lie dormant in brain cells until scientists turned it on with a chemical switch. The scientists found that switching on UBE3A failed to prevent or reverse the high susceptibility to seizures in adult Angelman mice. However, switching on the gene when the mice were just three weeks old made them as resistant to seizures as ordinary mice. ""Three weeks of age for a mouse corresponds to early childhood for a human, so this suggests that there may be a window of opportunity in childhood for the prevention of Angelman syndrome epilepsy,"" said first author Bin Gu, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the Philpot Lab who performed most of the key experiments.

MF: Thank you, Lucy. Welcome to Abcam’s Post-Translational Modifications webinar. I will start with a brief introduction on post-translational modifications before moving into ubiquitylation. After discussing ubiquitylation, our guest speaker, Kevin, will give you a historic overview on the field, and discuss how ubiquitylation is increasing its medical relevance. Finally, Judith will take you through phosphorylation and she will end this webinar by sharing with you several resources and related products available from Abcam. So what are post-translational modifications? Post-translational modifications, or PTMs, are in vivo chemical modifications of a protein after its translation, which can occur at any step in the life of a protein. PTMs have been mainly studied in nucleated cells, and they are conserved from yeast to humans which demonstrates how essential they are for cellular function ability. PTMs play a key role in functional proteomics regulating activity, localization and interaction of proteins with other proteins, nucleic acid or co-factors. In fact, it is estimated that about 5% of the human disease-associated mutations may affect PTM status in cells. Post-translational modifications are generally classified by the type of change they create. The most common one is the addition of a functional group or proteins to the amino acids. Examples are acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and SUMOylation. Modifications can also be caused by a change on the chemical nature of the residues, such as carbamylation or deamination. Lastly, modifications can be caused by structural changes in the protein, like proteolytic cleavage or formation of disulfide bridges. In this webinar we will focus on ubiquitylation and phosphorylation. So first let's talk about ubiquitylation. What is ubiquitylation? Ubiquitylation, also known as ubiquitination, is the addition of one or multiple ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues in a particular protein. Ubiquitin is a fairly small protein, only 76 residues, but it's found in all eukaryotic cells, and it is highly conserved among species. The main key features of ubiquitin are a C-terminal tail and 7 lysine residues. Ubiquitin can be linked to proteins either as a mono-ubiquitin, a single molecule attached in which case can be involved in regulation or receptor endocytosis, or as a poly-ubiquitin chain, which then can be involved in proteasomal degradation. So how does ubiquitin get attached to a protein? The ubiquitylation process consists of three main steps. Initially, ubiquitin is activated by an ubiquitin-activating enzyme or E1, in an ATP-dependent process. The C-terminal carboxyl tail of ubiquitin will bind to the E1 enzyme. From the E1 the ubiquitin is then transferred to the cysteine on the active site of the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, also known as E2 via a trans(thio)esterification reaction. The final step of the cascade creates an isopeptide bond between a lysine residue on the substrate and the C-terminal end of the ubiquitin molecule. These steps require the activity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme. E3 ligases function at substrate recognition models, and are capable of interacting with both the E2 and the substrate. Ubiquitylation itself is a reversible reaction and the enzymes responsible for clearing ubiquitin protein bonds are known as the ubiquitinating enzymes or DUBs. The ubiquitylation enzymes are structured in a phenomenal way. The E1 enzyme family is quite small with only nine different E1s described in humans. One E1 enzyme can associate with several E2s. There is a great diversity of E2s when compared to E1s, and each type of E2 enzyme can generally associate with several E3s. There is even a greater diversity of E3s compared to E2s, and that's because E3 enzymes are responsible for setting substrate specificity. There are commonly more than 600 putative E3 ligases described in humans. It is important not to forget the ubiquitinating enzymes, although to its fairly recent discovery, there are still a lot of things we don't know about them. What we know is that they are more promiscuous than E3s. Over 80 putative DUBs have been described so far in humans, which means that one DUB can interact with several E3 ligases. We are going to look briefly now at the different types of ubiquitin E3 ligases. I will focus mainly on the two main important type of E3 ligases. The main family of E3 ligases are the RING ligases, which contain a zinc finger ring domain. Known members of this family are BRCA1, Mdm2 and XIAP. As you can see from this diagram, the RING ligases mediate the direct transfer of the ubiquitin molecules from the E2 to the lysine in the substrate. The other main family, the HECT ligases share a common HECT catalytic domain. The best known member of this family is E6AP, in which the family takes the name, as well as other proteins such as Nedd4. Contrary to RING ligases, HECT ligases mediate ubiquitylation by forming an intermediate between the E2 protein and the ubiquitin. From this intermediate, the ubiquitin molecules will then be transferred to the lysine residue on the substrate. I will now focus on the different types of ubiquitylation, and how they affect the ubiquitylated substrate. Mono-ubiquitylation is the addition of one ubiquitin molecule to one lysine residue in the substrate. This type of modification is generally involved in signaling and regulation, as well as receptor tyrosine kinase endocytosis. Multi-ubiquitylation is the addition of one ubiquitin to several lysine residues in the substrate. This type of modification is generally involved in receptor tyrosine kinase endocytosis, and endosome sorting. Poly-ubiquitylation is the addition of several ubiquitin molecules chained to each other and linked to one lysine residue in the substrate. As previously mentioned, ubiquitin contains several lysine residues that all can be used as linking points for poly-ubiquitin chain formation. The ubiquitin residue to which all the ubiquitin molecules RING bind to form the chain, defines the space of the poly-ubiquitylated protein. For example, lysine 48 poly chain is the most well-known ubiquitin modification. Formation of a chain of poly-ubiquitins all link through lysine 48 will lead to proteasome degradation of the ubiquitylated protein. Other well-known chains are lysine 63 involved in DNA repair, and lysine 11 which is involved in NF-kB activation. Let's look now at the steps to follow to determine whether our protein of interest is ubiquitylated. There are generally three main ways to investigate any post-translational modifications: in silico , to a computational tool; in vivo and in vitro . I will briefly touch on in silico detections. Briefly, because, unfortunately, there are no clear consensus motifs for ubiquitylation, and the current ubiquitylation prediction sites are only available for yeast proteins at the moment. If you would like more information about this site, just contact us through the Q&A panel on the right of your screen so we can give you more information later on about these sites. The main way to study whether a protein is ubiquitylated is through in vivo studies, and a lysine ubiquitylation pattern. You start with cells or tissue where the protein to study is expressed. If your protein is naturally not abundant in those particular cells, you can use overexpressed systems. For ubiquitylation analysis, you will perform a western blot. Needless to say, if you have used another expressed protein, you should always confirm your resource with the endogenous protein. To enrich the potentially ubiquitinated proteins as well to get a better detection, you should perform an immunoprecipitation once you have seen evidence for ubiquitylation. So let's review these steps one-by-one. You have prepared your samples, you have run your gels and blotted your membrane, and the detected protein you want using an antibody against that protein. If your protein is ubiquitylated you will notice that it migrates slower than the expected molecular weight, and you probably will see a smear of a shift on top of the band. In this first example, cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor, which led to the appearance of a ladder smear when detecting p53. This is a typical signal of proteasome-dependent K48 poly-ubiquitination. In the other example on the right you can see FANCD2, which is a DNA repair protein involved in homologous combination. FANCD2 usually runs at 155 kDa, which is known as the FANCD2-S form, but upon treatment with cross-linking reagents such as cisplatin, FANCD2 becomes mono-ubiquitylated and can be detected as this lower band running at 162 kDa, which is then known as FANCD2-L form. To confirm that your shift is due to ubiquitylation, you should always perform an immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation not only helps to enrich your protein fractions, but also clears your lysates from extra protein that might interfere with your detection. The protein of interest is generally immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody against the protein itself, or against the tag if you are using an overexpressed protein, and the blot is incubated with an ubiquitin-specific antibody. On the blot appearing on this slide you can see how an overexpressed protein was pulled down using a FLAG antibody, and then blot using a generic ubiquitin antibody. The smear you can see on the right lane is typical of a poly-ubiquitylated protein via the proteasome pathway. In addition to general ubiquitin antibodies, you can also use antibody-specific for ubiquitin chain detection. The most common antibodies used are FK1 and FK2, and these antibodies don't bind to free ubiquitin, and whereas FK2 will bind to mono- and poly-ubiquitin, FK1 will only bind to poly-ubiquitin. The use of both of these antibodies will always help you to understand which type of chain it is. As you can see on the set of blots shown on this slide, cells were treated with proteasome inhibitors and separated in different cellular fractions. Then p53, which was the target protein investigated in this case, was pulled down with a p53-specific antibody. The membranes were then proofed with FK2, which are section A and section B; and FK1, which is shown at the bottom. You can see that there is a clear p53 smear present in all three blots in the nucleolus fraction, which is where the golden arrow is shown. From this experiment we can conclude that p53 is fully ubiquitylated as is picked by both FK1 and FK2 antibodies. In vitro analysis will also help us to define which specific lysine residue is ubiquitylated, as well as identifying which type of ubiquitin chain is being formed. This is usually done through a combination of truncation analysis, and in vitro ubiquitylation assay. In a truncation analysis different sections of the ubiquitylated protein are expressed. When detecting the ubiquitylation reaction on a western blot using an ubiquitin antibody, only the section containing the modified lysine will show on the blot. This allows to pinpoint which specific area the lysine of interest is located. Once the ubiquitylated region has been defined, the next step is to mutate lysines to arginines to define which is the actual residue that will be ubiquitylated. Arginines are hydrophobic and structurally very similar to lysines, but cannot be ubiquitylated which makes them the perfect substituting mutations. There is a caveat though: when modifying a lysine on ubiquitylation sequences, be aware that you are not disturbing a SUMOylation site. For instance, on PCNA the same lysine is both ubiquitylated and SUMOylated, and although this will not affect the ubiquitylation reaction, it will probably have a great effect on the in vivo action that you see on the protein. Of course, once you have identified the lysine you think is ubiquitylated, always confirm through mass spectrometry. An in vitro ubiquitylation reaction is the ideal system to identify the specifics of the reaction in which factors are essential. To set up an ubiquitylation reaction you will need a substrate, which is your protein of interest. The substrate can be recombinant or purified from cells. You will also need the whole set of ubiquitin conjugated enzymes as well as ubiquitin, so make sure that you are using the appropriate set of enzymes, especially the E3 ligase, so check the available literature, or check with your colleagues if they have done similar experiments previously. If your protein is fully ubiquitylated you might also want to use ubiquitin mutants as well as the wild-type, because this will help you to identify which type of poly chain is being formed. As with any reaction, you will also need a negative and a positive control. Ubiquitylation is an ATP-dependent reaction, so you will need ATP in the mixture. Also, check the literature to see if there are any co-factors that are necessary for the ubiquitylation of your protein. The experiment shown in this slide you can see the in vitro ubiquitylation reaction of a histone H2A by BRCA1/BARD1 dimer using radioactively labeled ubiquitin. In lane 1, you can see how the substrate histone H2A is mono-ubiquitylated when all the factors are present, and that's when it's labeled complete. If you take out any of the conjugated enzymes or the ATP, the ubiquitylation doesn't take place, as you can see from lanes 2, 3, 4 and 6. Interestingly, this experiment also shows that BRCA1/BARD1 auto-ubiquitylates itself, as you can see at the top of lane 1 and lane 5. You can see in the image there is a big band appearing even in the absence of the substrate. This is a good example of mono-ubiquitylation reaction, because there's a fairly clear, distinct band both in the BRCA1 locations and in the ubiquitylated histone H2A. In this experiment, the researchers used a ubiquitin antibody instead of radioactive ubiquitin. This blot shows how Pellino 1 acts as an E3 ligase catalyzing the formation of a poly-ubiquitin chain in IRAK1, which is a serine threonine kinase involved in NFkB upregulation. To further identify which type of chain was formed, the researchers used different mutated ubiquitin variants. As you can see from the blot, when wild-type or K48 ubiquitin mutant was used, a poly-ubiquitin chain was still formed. However, when a K63R ubiquitin mutant was used, no chain was seen. This confirms then that Pellino 1 is an E3 ligase for IRAK and catalyzes the formation of K63 poly chain ubiquitins. I would like to share now with you some tips and troubleshooting to keep in mind when determining whether the protein of interest that you are studying is ubiquitylated or not. So what can you do if you're not sure about a shift/smear that you see in your western blot? When you're preparing your cells or your lysates add MG-132, which is a very well-known proteasome inhibitor. As you probably remember, this has been used in some of the examples shown on the previous slides. But the proteins that are signaling for proteasome degradation via a K48 poly chain, additional MG-132 will increase the concentration. You can also add NEM, N-ethylmaleimide, which is a general deubiquitinating enzyme inhibitor. Similarly to MG-132, inhibiting the degradation of the ubiquitin signal will increase the chances of detection. Also, make sure when you are preparing your cells that you are using the optimal conditions. If, for example, your protein is ubiquitylated at a particular time during the cell cycle, try to synchronize your cells and harvest them at the right time. If your ubiquitylated protein accumulates in a particular cell compartment, make sure that you're harvesting the right fraction as this will give you the strongest signal. Make sure that your running gel conditions are optimal. Always ensure that your protein is fully denatured by adding beta-mercaptoethanol or DTT to your sample buffer. Although this might sound quite obvious, make sure that you are using a gel percentage that is optimal for your protein and will allow you to see the shift. Always run your gels low to avoid smiling. When running a gel for a long time it is always recommended to run it at 4°C to avoid overheating. Either run your gels in a cold room overnight or in a bucket of ice. If your signal is very weak, try then to use BSA instead of milk for blocking your membrane. Again, make sure that the antibody you're using is specific for your protein, because otherwise you could pick up ubiquitylation for similar proteins, or several isoforms of the protein you are studying. If your in vitro reaction hasn't worked, make sure that you have all the co-factors needed for the reaction. A good tip is to avoid mixing E1 and E2 enzymes from different sources, either use them either from a commercial source, or from your own purification. Again, this might sound obvious, but make sure that you are using the appropriate E3 ligase for the reaction. If you don't know just check the literature, or maybe just get some people that have done this reaction previously. I would like to conclude this section with a quick summary on the main points discussed on ubiquitylation. Ubiquitylation is a post-translational modification that controls many processes within cells. The addition of ubiquitin to proteins is a tightly regulated mechanism. The E3 ubiquitin ligases are the enzymes responsible for the substrate-specificity. The substrate can be either mono-ubiquitylated, when one ubiquitin is attached to one lysine; multi-ubiquitylated, when several lysines receive one ubiquitin each; or poly-ubiquitylated, when one lysine receives a chain of several ubiquitins. The type of chain form will regulate the space of the ubiquitylated protein. Determining the site and function of a ubiquitylation event should be done through a combination of in vivo and in vitro studies. If you have any questions about the topics we have discussed and any other one that we couldn't discuss through time constraints, please submit your questions through the Q&A panel on the right of your screen. Without further delay, I will pass the microphone to Kevin who will talk to you about historical review of ubiquitylation and the future of the field. KH: Thanks very much, Miriam. So as you’ve seen from Miriam ubiquitylation is one of the most versatile and powerful forms of post-translational modification in cells, controlling many important cellular functions and involves more than 1,000 proteins. In this part of the presentation I'm going to give a bit of historic perspective to the discovery of ubiquitylation. I'm then going to talk about the versatility of the system and its control of cellular function, and then give some views on how this system impacts on medicine and drug discovery, and perhaps where the future lies for research. So the process of protein ubiquitylation was discovered in the late-70’s and early-80‘s, and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2004. The recipients of this award were Avram Hershko and Aaron Ciechanover, both at the Technion Israel Institute for Technology in Haifa; and Irwin Rose, at the time of the citation, at the University of California at Irvine, but did his seminal work at the Fox Chase Cancer Centre in Philadelphia. The award was actually given for the discovery of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, a very important finding at the time, but back then it was probably not quite clear how important this process was going to be generally in addition to its role in protein degradation. Now, like most major discoveries, the science often starts off with a very simple question, and this is no exception. The question at the time was how are proteins degraded in cells, and why is energy required in this process? So the prevaling view in the 70’s was that the majority of misfolded and aggregated proteins were degraded through an organelle called the lysosome, into which proteins were subsumed and proteolytically degraded. However, this clearly wasn't the complete story. Firstly, it didn't explain how different proteins had turnover rates that were different. Secondly, the inhibitors of lysosomes could be applied to cells which were still able to turnover different proteins in an ATP-dependent manner; and, therefore, clearly was not responsible for the complete degradation of proteins in the cell. Finally, it was not clear why energy would be required in a process which is essentially exergonic and, therefore, produces energy, so what was this energy being required for? So this is where Avram Hershko and his PhD student, Aaron Ciechanover, started out and they took the classical biochemical approach to try and identify ATP-dependent proteolytic degradation in cell extracts. In this classical piece of biochemistry they were very successful in doing this. They started off with a reticulocyte lysate which they fractionated into several fractions, which they could mix together and get ATP-dependent proteolysis. In particular, they had two fractions: fraction 1 of which contained a heat-stable component of unknown identity, which they called ATP-dependent proteolytic factor 1. Now, this fraction could be added back to the second fraction to reconstitute the whole ATP-dependent proteolytic reaction. In later work with Irwin Rose, Ciechanover and Hershko subdivided fraction 2 into two more fractions; one of which contained an ATP stabilized protease, and another contained a number of factors required for ATP-dependent proteolytic degradation. The important thing here being then, you could mix these 3 fractions and get back the reconstituted reaction. Analysis of this very powerful system continued and a number of important findings were made. Firstly, ATP-dependent proteolytic factor 1 was identified as a protein ubiquitin. Secondly, ubiquitin was shown to become conjugated to substrates which then underwent degradation, and this covalent attachment of the ubiquitin occurred through an isopeptide bond. They also isolated various other components to the reaction, outlined by Miriam, the E1, E2 and E3 ubiquitin-activating-conjugating and ligase proteins. The importance of their findings was firstly that they identified an ATP-dependent proteolytic system that was different from that of the lysosome. They also showed that it contained multiple components, and it wasn't an individual protease. Thirdly, it explained how you could have a tagging system which enables the protease and the substrate to be in the same cellular compartment, but in a regulated way so that protease activity does not go rampant on the substrates. This also explained the versatility of the degradation system in that it was tightly regulated, and different proteins could be regulated at different rates by specific tagging of the ubiquitin. So, basically, they outlined a system of ubiquitin tagging involving these E1, E2 and E3 components that Miriam talked about, which identified a substrate for proteolytic degradation by the proteasome. But this was a biochemical demonstration, and what was really lacking at this point was a biological analysis of the importance of this protein system in cells. This is where we introduce another major figure in ubiquitin biology, Alexander Varshavsky. He was a Russian scientist working at MIT and he was aware of Hershko, Ciechanover and Rose's work, but wanted to know what the impact of this system was in a cell. Now, genetically manipulating mammalian cells was not so easy back then, but Varshavsky identified a cell line which had a very interesting property. It was the conditional lethal cell line which when elevated in temperature, lost a protein in the cell which looked like ubiquitylated Histone H2A, suggesting that the cell line may be defective in one or more components of the ubiquitylation system. He characterized this further to show that this cell line ts85 has a temperature-sensitive mutation in the ubiquitin-activating E1 enzyme. Because it has an inactive E1 at higher temperatures, histone H2A was not becoming ubiquitylated. At the same time, because the ubiquitin mediated degradation process wasn't going on, the bulk proteins which are normally degraded by the ubiquitin system accumulated at elevated temperature. But most importantly, because these cells died, he showed that the ubiquitin proteasome system was actually essential for cell existence. To follow his ideas about generating a genetic system with which to study ubiquitylation, Varshavsky then turned his attention to the ubiquitin system in yeast where he made many seminal discoveries, along with his colleagues, such as Dan Finley. For example, it was the Varshavsky lab which first showed that the ubiquitin existed as a poly-ubiquitin precursor, which needed to be degraded before ubiquitin could then be added to substrates. He also identified a degron sequence which targeted specific proteins for degradation. Finally, he also identified a role for this ubiquitylation system in the cellular response to DNA damage. So let's turn now to the versatility of the system. Miriam went through the formation of ubiquitin chains earlier, but let's just go over this again. Initially, ubiquitin is added to an internal lysine in a substrate, but iterative rounds of ubiquitylation often no longer target the substrate directly, but become conjugated to the first ubiquitin that has been added. Now, this ubiquitin, as Miriam pointed out, has seven lysines and so the conjugation to ubiquitin can occur at one of seven positions. In the case of K48 chains, which are known for tagging for proteolytic degradation, this chain is fairly long, and it is recognized by the proteasome. However, you can also form chains on other ubiquitin residues such as lysine 63, and the point here is that by forming this different form of chains you'll end up with a different product. The structure of a lysine 63 link chain is likely to be very different from a lysine 48 link chain, it may be stiffer, it may be longer, it presents the individual different ubiquitin subunits in a different fashion for recognition by ubiquitin binding proteins of which there are many. So this just gives you an example of the kind of different flavors of product that ubiquitylation can give rise to. So what about the function of these different chains, and different ubiquitin modifications? Well, we've talked before about K48 chains and how they're involved primarily in protein turnover. For example, the K48 chains which regulate the availability of cyclins, which control the cell division cycle. Lysine 11 chains are also involved in targeting proteins for degradation, but, interestingly, they seem to arise through the activity of a particular complex: the anaphase-promoting complex and, therefore, are almost exclusively associated with mitosis. K63 chains, rather than being involved in protein turnover, act as platforms in signaling pathways, for example, in NF-kB and in the DNA damage response. For example, K63 linked ubiquitin chains added to histone H2A calls the downstream recruitment of several proteins, including another ubiquitin ligase, BRCA1, which has been shown to capitalize the formation of lysine 6 chains. The function of lysine 6 chains is currently unknown. Not to be forgotten, is one of the earliest ubiquitin modifications identified, that which occurs on histones. This is mono-ubiquitylation, it's not involved in protein degradation. But the modification of histone H2A and H2B has been shown to act as an important marker for regulating gene expression profiles. This is achieved, it is thought largely, through its ability to modulate chromatin compaction and, therefore, the ubiquitylation of H2A and H2B is likely to be very important in epigenetics and the marking of cellular identity. So ubiquitylation has been linked with a number of diseases, some of which are listed here. I'll just go over a few of them, for example, Fanconi's anaemia, a haematological disease in which mutation in one or more of the factors which impair the ubiquitylation of the Fanconi D2 protein, cause the patients to have attrition of their bone marrow stem cells and aplastic anaemia; and later on cancer predisposition. Muscle atrophy, which can occur following long-term immobilization or as a consequence of other diseases such as cancer, occurs largely as an imbalance between protein synthesis and protein breakdown, and we can see how loss of the ubiquitin proteasome system and protein breakdown might destabilize this. In cancer, a number of different cancers have been linked with the ubiquitin proteasome system, in particular p53 which we know is mutated in 50% of cancers, but is probably somehow disregulated in almost 100% of cancers. Many defects occur in the proteolytic system for regulating p53 function, and that is associated with ubiquitylation. Other diseases such as inherited blindness, inherited Parkinsonism and Angelman syndrome have also been linked to defects in ubiquitylation, and more recently the ability of viruses to infect cells has been shown to be dependent on ubiquitylation. So how can we interfere with these ubiquitin pathways as a potential to disease therapy? Well, we could interfere with the activity of the E1 protein, but that's a rather blunt tool as it should disrupt the whole of the ubiquitin pathway. Slightly more specific is the inhibition of E2 proteins, which may be an individual E2 protein, may be limited to a particular cellular function but it's still going to affect a lot of individual proteins. More specific would be in interfering with the activity on the individual E3 ligase. Now, - inhibition of any of these three proteins - would result in a decrease in ubiquitylation, and an increase in the protein substrate. However, as Miriam said, deubiquitylating enzymes are very important and if we inhibit those we are likely to increase ubiquitylation of the substrate, targeting it for degradation. Finally, there's a possibility of inhibiting the proteasome. Now, this, again, seems to be a blunt tool, but actually turns out to be rather successful. Inhibition of the proteasome using velcade or bortezamib has been found to be a very good treatment for multiple myeloma. This proteasome inhibitor binds to the catalytic site of the 26S proteasome and inhibits clearly not all protein degradation, but sufficient to help in remission of multiple myeloma. Other compounds listed here interfere with the p53 pathway by inhibiting Mdm2 or inhibiting the interaction between Mdm2 and p53 to effect p53 turnover. Again, we talked about muscle atrophy earlier, P013222 is a compound which inhibits the MuRF1 E3 ligase which is overexpressed in muscle atrophy, with potential therapeutic responses. So what's the future? Well, there's a number of things to point to. Firstly, there's likely to be an increase in the number of ubiquitin-related diseases identified. Secondly, we can use the information we have to therapeutically target the ubiquitin pathway for therapy in these diseases. Finally, I think there's a lot of subtleties left in understanding the ubiquitin system, the different forms of ubiquitin chains that are formed, the different proteins that are involved in this process in order to identify potential new targets of therapy. At this point, I'm going to hand you over to Judith who's going to talk to you about another very important point of post-translational modification, and that is phosphorylation. JL: Hello everybody, my name is Judith and I'm going to take you through the phosphorylation part of the webinar. Before I start I would quickly like to remind you that you can submit questions for Miriam, our guest speaker, and the phosphorylation part via the Q&A panel on the right hand side of your screen. The basic mechanism of phosphorylation is kind of comparable to ubiquitylation. Indeed, ubiquitylation has been named the new phosphorylation. A kinase is a type of enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from high energy donor molecules such as ATP, and covalently attaches them to a substrate. This process is known as phosphorylation and reversed by enzymes known as phosphatases. Before I continue, I would quickly like to summarize the key facts about phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is the addition of phosphate; it is the reversible process that is conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In most eukaryotes serine, threonine and tyrosine residues become phosphorylated; I’m saying most as some eukaryotes such as plants and slime molds have been reported to assist within phosphorylation. In eukaryotes, serine phosphorylation is the most common, and tyrosine phosphorylation is the most rare. In prokaryotes, phosphorylation does not only occur in serine, threonine and tyrosine, but also in histidine, arginine and lysine residues. After having given you a brief overview, I would like to look in a bit more detail at the key enzymes involved in the phosphorylation process. This diagram shows the human kinome, which encompasses 518 kinases that fall into eight families. These families have been often named after the substrates they phosphorylate. Most kinases act on serine and threonine residues, others on tyrosine and some are dual specificity kinases, which can phosphorylate serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. Specific inhibitors are available for kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase 3. These originally started off as broad spectrum kinase inhibitors such as lithium, and that's been developed into more sophisticated inhibitors that specifically inhibit the activity of a single kinase. How do I know that the protein I'm working on is a kinase? You can use websites such as InterProScan from the European Bioinformatics Institute, which predict motifs. As you can see, the protein sequence I submitted is a kinase and, more specifically, a dual specificity kinase. If you have any preferred modes of prediction sites, please feel free to share them with the audience by entering them into the panel in the right hand corner of your screen. We will make them available to attendees after the webinar. Because kinases have profound effects on the cell their activity is highly-regulated. Kinases themselves are turned on or off by phosphorylation. This could be the autophosphorylation or by the activation of an upstream kinase. Their activity also gets regulated by binding activator and inhibitor proteins. On this slide, you can see the sequence alignment of three human kinases. The kinase domain starts in the orange box and contains a p-loop, a catalytic loop and an activation loop. Phosphatases fall into similar families to kinases, they are serine/threonine phosphatases, tyrosine phosphatases, also called PTPs, and dual specificity phosphatases. In total, there are hundreds of serine/threonine phosphatases, and around 90 dual specificity and tyrosine phosphatases in the human genome. As for kinases, you can use prediction programs to identify whether your protein of interest is a phosphatase. In general, phosphatases are a lot less well understood due to the lack of specific inhibitors. Next, I would like to look at the different types of phosphorylation. There is mono-phosphorylation: one phosphate group is added to one residue. There is multi-phosphorylation: one phosphate group is added to multiple residues. Poly-phosphorylation: the equivalent of poly-ubiquitylation does not exist. In the next part of the webinar I would like to help you identify whether the protein you are working on is phosphorylated, and, if so, identify the type and actual site of phosphorylation. To get a first idea of whether the protein you are working on could be phosphorylated, it is good to use phosphorylation prediction sites. I would start off with identifying whether your protein is conserved in other species, and, if so, check the literature to find out the phosphorylation site. This can be quickly done by using UniProt, as is shown here for beta-catenin. I would then follow this up with a sequence alignment to check whether the residue is conserved in the species you are working on. Several websites are available to predict phosphorylation sites, for example, NetPhos 2.0. The example shown here is for tyrosine phosphorylation predictions. As you can see, all tyrosine residues within the protein are listed according to where they are located. The program awards a score to each residue. One is the highest possible score and zero the lowest, therefore, the tyrosine residue shown in blue with the respective scores of 0.92 and 0.884 are the ones most likely to be phosphorylated. Another example is the Scansite Motif Scanner, which allows you to look at whether your protein of interest could be the substrate of a specific kinase. An example is shown here for Abl and Akt kinase substrates. If you're using different websites to predict phosphorylation sites, please feel free to share them with the audience by entering them into the right hand panel corner of your screen. We will make them available to all delegates after the webinar. Should you have been lucky enough to find that only one residue as predicted to be phosphorylated, you might be able to perform western blot analysis for commercially available antibodies. The western blot shown here is detecting serine 10 phosphorylation of histone H3. The histone 3 variants are predominantly found in non-dividing cells. As we can see here, colcemid treatment results in the metaphase arrest and, therefore, an increased serine 10 phosphorylation on histone H3. Abcam offers a variety of phospho-specific antibodies covering various research areas ranging from epigenetics to microbiology. This western blot looks at the difference in phosphorylation of a STAT protein in response to different treatment periods. STAT proteins are transcription factors that become activated and move to the nucleus in response to phosphorylation. This blot compares STAT activation in the knockout versus a random integrant strain. A random integrant is the cell line where the gene disruption cassette is randomly integrated into the genome. It looks like there is a clear difference between these two cell lines. However, to confirm and quantify the difference of phosphorylation, you have to first ensure that equal amounts of protein have been loaded. We can determine this by using a general loading control such as tubulin. However, it is better to probe for the non-phosphorylated form of the protein to ensure that the protein levels of the protein you're interested in were equal to start off with. This can either be done by stripping and re-probing the membrane, or by starting of running duplicate gels. For normalization and quantifications, you can use free software such as ImageJ. One thing to keep in mind is that you should not overload the gel, do not overexpose the film, and as film is never linear we recommend using a fluorescent scanner as these allow more accurate quantifications. Also, repeat the experiment multiple times to determine the average and the standard deviations. What if the prediction software programs or commercial antibodies have not shed any light as to whether your protein of interest is phosphorylated? Then the best way forward is to run a western blot of an immunoprecipitated protein. Phosphorylation will normally reside in a reduction of a protein's mobility on SDS-PAGE. This can be observed in the below blot where treatment results and increased mobility, also referred to as a mobility shift. Alternatively, two bands can be observed. Of the two bands, the upper one is the phosphorylated variant and the lower one is the non-phosphorylated form. How can I ensure to get a clear mobility shift? Use IP samples as this results in a concentration of your protein of interest. Find the best percentage gel and for smaller proteins, you should increase the percentage, and for larger proteins you should reduce the percentage. Find the best type of gel and buffer. It is better to run a single percentage gel than a gradient gel, and consider different gel types such as Tris-Glycine and Tris-Acetate gel. You can also consider different running buffers such as MOPS and MES to increase resolution. Run the gel slowly to avoid smiling and also run the gel in an ice-bucket or in the cold room to avoid overheating. Another indication of whether a protein is phosphorylated or not is whether you can see a shift on a 2D gel. Indeed, phosphorylation replaces neutral hydroxide groups and negatively charged phosphate groups. Below pH 5.5, phosphates add a single negative charge; around pH6.5, they add 1.5, and around pH7.5 two negative charges. In the example shown here, you can see that the protein migrates as a series of irregular spots. Upon treatment, the protein shifts towards the acidic range. IgG was used as a loading control here to ensure that equal amounts of proteins were loaded to start off with. As not only phosphorylation can result in such a shift, but also as a modification such as acetylation, it is best to perform phosphatase treatment. In this case, a serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphatase such as lambda or alkaline phosphatase was used. As we can see, the dots disappear and the protein shifts towards the basic range. Phosphatase-treated samples can also be run on a 1D gel. As we can see here, treatment with the serine/threonine phosphatase such as PP2A abolishes the mobility shift. As a control, PP2A treatment together with a phosphatase inhibitor was performed. In that sample, again, the mobility shift can be observed. Phosphatase inhibitor treatment should always be performed as a negative control. As we have seen on the previous slides, treatment with serine/threonine versus serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphatases can be performed to distinguish between tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation. Alternatively, you can perform western blot analysis with phospho-serine-specific antibodies. An example of this is shown here. For p53 serine phosphorylation after your retreatment. You can also perform western blotting with phospho-threonine, and phospho-tyrosine-specific antibodies, in addition to phospho-serine and threonine antibodies. After having determined the type of phosphorylation, it is key to identify the site. To identify the actual phosphorylation site, it is best to perform immunoprecipitation of the protein of interest from your cell line of choice, or a cell line overexpressing your tag protein of interest. The IP sample is run on SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining is performed, and the protein band is excised with a clean scalpel. This is followed by enzyme digestion. Commonly used enzymes are trypsin or chymotrypsin. However, you have to choose the proper digestion enzyme and the method according to your protein sequence. The last step in identifying the phosphorylation site is mass spectrometry analysis. What to keep in mind when performing phosphorylation site analysis? Avoid degradation by having the samples on ice at all times, and by adding sufficient amounts of protease inhibitors. Use sterile equipment to avoid keratin contamination, and do multiple repeats to ensure that the phosphopeptides you identify are real. How to identify the role of the phosphorylation? Once the peptide has been identified by mass spec it is important to determine the actual residue. For example, in the peptide sequence shown here, either the serine or the threonine, or both residues could be phosphorylated. Should you not have overlapping peptide sequence information available that helps you to identify either the serine or threonine is phosphorylated, it is easier to perform point mutations and knock these into your cell line of interest. Mutating a serine or threonine to an alanine will make the peptide unable to be phosphorylated and create a phospho-defective mutant. If you're analyzing tyrosine phosphorylations, the tyrosine residue would have to be mutated to phenylalanine to create phospho-defective mutants. Mutating the serine/threonine to glutamic acid or aspartic acid will mimic phosphorylation; you are creating pseudo-phosphorylation as you're replacing the residue with an amino acid that has an endogenous negative charge. In general, it is best to do both single and multiple point mutations, and to analyze whether mobility shift can still be observed in these. It is also important to establish whether the mutants are viable, and to determine whether there are morphological phenotypes. For example, phosphorylation could alter a protein's activity, cellular localizations or interaction partners. To further investigate, it is best to generate phospho-specific antibodies and to identify the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation by performing in vitro kinase assays. Next, we will look at how to troubleshoot the detection of phosphorylation. What to keep in mind when wanting to detect phosphorylation? Keep the samples on ice at all times and add freshly prepared phosphatase inhibitors, including general inhibitors such as phosphatase inhibitor cocktails and specific inhibitors like sodium fluoride, which is a protein serine phosphatase inhibitor. Or sodium orthovanadate which specifically inhibits protein tyrosine phosphatases. If you establish the optimal phosphorylation conditions, are you using the correct stimulus and the right amount of stimulation at the correct developmental stage? For SDS-PAGE conditions, is your sample properly denatured? Also make sure that you're using the optimal gel percentage buffer and gel type, and that you're running the gel slowly and at 4°C. In order to avoid a high background signal, use BSA as a blocking agent. Do not use milk, as milk contains the phospho-protein casein, which will be picked up by the phospho-specific antibodies. Use TBST and not PBST as your buffer, as PBS contains phosphate. Should you like more information about how to perform western blot detection of phospho-proteins, have a look at our phospho-western blot protocols. For more general western blot and IP information, check out our previous webinars on western blotting and immunoprecipitation, and have a look at our western blot troubleshooting tips. To summarize the phosphorylation part of the webinar, phosphorylation is a post-translational modification that controls many processes within cells. Indeed, it is estimated that 30% of the proteome is phosphorylated. It is the addition of phosphate to proteins, and this mechanism is tightly regulated. Kinases are responsible for the specificity of the phosphorylation reaction. Proteins can either be mono- or multi-phosphorylated, and serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation can alter a protein's activity, cellular localization and interaction partners. Determining the site and function of a phosphorylation event should be a combination of experiments. I would now like to introduce some of our products that will enable you to detect and identify post-translational modifications. Abcam offers a range of active ubiquitin and ubiquitin-related proteins, including single lysine ubiquitin proteins, lysine to arginine ubiquitin mutants, E1s, E2s, E3, DUBs and ubiquitin-like proteins such as SUMO. For more information please have a look at our ubiquitin resource page. For superior western blot results, Abcam offers our Optiblot western blot product range. This new range contains pre-cast gels, running buffers, prism protein ladders and gel-staining reagents. In addition to that, we have Optiblot electrophoresis kits providing denatured/unnatured proteins. If you are intrigued, please have a look at our Optiblot resource pages. For the detection step of your western blotting experiment, we recommend AbExcel secondary antibodies. These 19 AP- and HRP-conjugated secondaries have been extensively tested in the Abcam labs. The optimal dilution has been determined, and we are pleased to tell you that you can do over 1,500 blots with a vial of AP-conjugated, and over 600 blots with a vial of HRP-conjugated AbExcel secondary antibodies. If you would like to learn more, please view our AbExcel pages. An alternative to determining the amount of phosphorylated proteins by western blotting, is to perform ELISAs. In general, ELISAs tend to be more accurate than western blotting and allow the detection of lower banding proteins. Our fast and sensitive Phospho-Tracer ELISA kits allow the accurate detection of a single phosphorylation site, such as Akt serine 473 phosphorylations. We also have Phospho-Tracer ELISA kits to measure the modified and total form of a protein, and to detect a combination of modifications of several members of a protein family at once. For more information, please have a look at our Phospho-Tracer resource pages. AbcamBiochemicals offer a large selection of high purity and exceptional quality products. To elucidate phosphorylation processes, various kinase activity modulators and phosphatase inhibitors are available.

I would like to thank Miriam and Kevin, and all of you for attending and would like to let you know that the three of us are happy to now answer your questions. MF: Thank you, Judith. We have a question from Sophie and she's asking: In a poly-ubiquitin chain can you have different linkages, for instance, K83 then K67? Why or why not, and, if so, which ubiquitin determines the fate of the substrate? I think Kevin can answer this question. KH: Okay Sophie, well, there is evidence that you can get mixed chains, mixed ubiquitin chains both in vitro and in vivo , but I could say at this point, the function of those mixed chains is unlikely to be understood, probably even partially. So in vitro it's very difficult, because ubiquitin ligases are very promiscuous and so you don't know if what you're looking at is really biologically relevant. In vivo looking at chains is very difficult without reagents that specifically target those ubiquitin chains and, again, those are proving very elusive. So, yes, it can occur, but its function was not at all clear. MF: I have another question for Judy from Jung Li, and she's asking: Does phosphorylation occur in a particular subcellular site, for instance, the Golgi, or can this modification occur anywhere in the cell? JL: It is known that phosphorylation can occur anywhere within the cells; it's not limited to a specific site. MF: We think we have time for one more question. Now, John is asking: What would you recommend as the best negative control for ubiquitylation assays? We would recommend a mix of controls, so, for instance, inactive E1, E2 or E3 enzymes, and ATP is always a very good control. Also, it's possible a non-specific substrate could be used. Ubiquitin mutants, as you can see, can also be used as a negative control. Also, for instance, a negative substrate which is unrelated to the ubiquitylation, so you’re sure this will not be ubiquitylated. JL: We've also got a question from David who asked us whether there is no easier way to determine that his protein of interest is tyrosine phosphorylated? To answer your question, David, you could do treatment with T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase, or you could perform an IP with commercially-available phospho-tyrosine sepharose or agarose beads. That's a lot quicker than going via the 2G gel experiments I showed you earlier. Thank you Kevin, Judith and Miriam.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4668868390318136113/New-data-back-Ovids-Angelman-drug,-say-analysts	New data back Ovid’s Angelman drug, say analysts	After reporting mixed results in a midstage trial earlier this year, Ovid Therapeutics has new data for its OV101 drug for rare disease Angelman syndrome that it says are looking a lot stronger. The STARS trial—reported at the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) conference this week—is the first industry-sponsored trial in Angelman, a disorder caused by a defect in the UBE3A gene that leads to delayed development, seizures, sleep problems and others medical issues. Ovid reported preliminary results from the STARS trial in August, with improvements across a range of measures that helped it achieve a significant improvement in Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scale from a single 15mg dose of OV101 given in the evening, and backed its safety and tolerability. There was some debate about the earlier readout, with analysts at Ladenburg Thalman saying it “suggested minimal benefits in sleep, motor, behavior or quality of life.” However, they now suggest the new data at AACAP has firmed up OV101’s clinical profile with “additional secondary endpoints with statistically significant or trends toward improvements.”. OV101 is a selective extra-synaptic GABA A receptor agonist vying to become the first-ever approved therapy for Angelman, which occurs in around 1 in 15,000 live births and is often misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy or autism. CEO Jeremy Levin said on a conference call that with the STARS data in hand, the plan now is to start an open-label extension study before the end of the year for all OV101-treated patients, using the 15mg once daily dose. “We believe the data…will support an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA by the end of the year,” he continued, and that should clarify the clinical requirements for a regulatory filing. Ladenburg Thalman think the likelihood is a second phase 2 trial in 2019 with a phase 3 study the following year, but suggest that Ovid may be able to proceed with a single phase 2/3 trial “as there is nothing approved or adequately used today to treat the problematic behaviors of Angelman.”. Other companies targeting Angelman include GeneTx Biotherapeutics , a startup launched by the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics (FAST) earlier this year that is focusing on the developing of antisense drugs for the disorder, and Marinus Pharma, which has a drug called ganaxolone in preclinical development for Angelman that has a similar mechanism of action to OV101. Other players include Sage Therapeutics and Zynerba Pharma. 	1	0	New|data|back|Ovid|’|s|Angelman|drug|,|say|analysts	After|reporting|mixed|results|in|a|midstage|trial|earlier|this|year|,|Ovid|Therapeutics|has|new|data|for|its|OV101|drug|for|rare|disease|Angelman|syndrome|that|it|says|are|looking|a|lot|stronger|.|The|STARS|trial|—|reported|at|the|American|Academy|of|Child|and|Adolescent|Psychiatry|(|AACAP|)|conference|this|week|—|is|the|first|industry-sponsored|trial|in|Angelman|,|a|disorder|caused|by|a|defect|in|the|UBE|3A|gene|that|leads|to|delayed|development|,|seizures|,|sleep|problems|and|others|medical|issues|.|Ovid|reported|preliminary|results|from|the|STARS|trial|in|August|,|with|improvements|across|a|range|of|measures|that|helped|it|achieve|a|significant|improvement|in|Clinical|Global|Impression|of|Improvement|(|CGI-I|)|scale|from|a|single|15mg|dose|of|OV101|given|in|the|evening|,|and|backed|its|safety|and|tolerability|.|There|was|some|debate|about|the|earlier|readout|,|with|analysts|at|Ladenburg|Thalman|saying|it|“|suggested|minimal|benefits|in|sleep|,|motor|,|behavior|or|quality|of|life|.|”|However|,|they|now|suggest|the|new|data|at|AACAP|has|firmed|up|OV101|’|s|clinical|profile|with|“|additional|secondary|endpoints|with|statistically|significant|or|trends|toward|improvements|.|”|.|OV101|is|a|selective|extra-synaptic|GABA|A|receptor|agonist|vying|to|become|the|first-ever|approved|therapy|for|Angelman|,|which|occurs|in|around|1|in|15,000|live|births|and|is|often|misdiagnosed|as|cerebral|palsy|or|autism|.|CEO|Jeremy|Levin|said|on|a|conference|call|that|with|the|STARS|data|in|hand|,|the|plan|now|is|to|start|an|open-label|extension|study|before|the|end|of|the|year|for|all|OV101|-|treated|patients|,|using|the|15mg|once|daily|dose|.|“|We|believe|the|data|…|will|support|an|end-of-phase|2|meeting|with|the|FDA|by|the|end|of|the|year|,|”|he|continued|,|and|that|should|clarify|the|clinical|requirements|for|a|regulatory|filing|.|Ladenburg|Thalman|think|the|likelihood|is|a|second|phase|2|trial|in|2019|with|a|phase|3|study|the|following|year|,|but|suggest|that|Ovid|may|be|able|to|proceed|with|a|single|phase|2/3|trial|“|as|there|is|nothing|approved|or|adequately|used|today|to|treat|the|problematic|behaviors|of|Angelman|.|”|.|Other|companies|targeting|Angelman|include|GeneTx|Biotherapeutics|,|a|startup|launched|by|the|Foundation|for|Angelman|Syndrome|Therapeutics|(|FAST|)|earlier|this|year|that|is|focusing|on|the|developing|of|antisense|drugs|for|the|disorder|,|and|Marinus|Pharma|,|which|has|a|drug|called|ganaxolone|in|preclinical|development|for|Angelman|that|has|a|similar|mechanism|of|action|to|OV101|.|Other|players|include|Sage|Therapeutics|and|Zynerba|Pharma|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4647532511052081697/Angelman-Syndrome-Find-a-Buddy	Angelman Syndrome-Find a Buddy	August 27, 2018 by Mary1991 4 Comments. For most of Jessie's years, we didn't know any Angel parents. We were on our own to reinvent the wheel, navigating seizures, and sleep disturbances. Even though we heard a few words and phrases, upon learning of her Angleman diagnosis (when she was 13), I let go of the hope that Jess would talk in a traditional way. I wish I had someone that I could have shared with that understood. Earlier this week, I met with the only local Angel mom I know. We met by chance at a dance. Ashley was a chaperone. As soon as she saw Jessie, she suspected she was an Angel because she has one too. She made it her mission to meet the rest of the family before Jess left that night. Even though our children are different ages and stages, this hasn't prevented us from appreciating each other's perspective. Unfortunately, we don't get to visit that often, but when we do, we talk about anything and everything and of course, all things Angel. We all don't have the luxury of being with an Angelman mom/dad but we all can find a cyber one. I don't know if this will work but with two other Angel parents, we have just started a new Facebook group, Angelman Syndrome-Find a Buddy. (for lack of better name). This is not another chat group. The sole purpose is to find another parent to connect to on a more personal level so we can reduce that feeling of being isolated. Every day, I read a parent announce they just were given a diagnosis. Others feel isolated because their needs are different from families who have typical children. Even when we were part of playgroups, I ended up being with Jess while the other mom's got to talk because Jess needed my support. Eventually, the divide grows wider as their children meet milestones at a much faster rate. For other parents with older children, their friends become empty nesters. Going out as couples became awkward because they don't want your third wheel. Believe me, I understand wanting a child-free zone and the luxury of being with just adults, however, we rarely get to do that. My new motto is, “If you are an Angelman parent and don't know another Angelman parent, then get one”! Why specifically an Angelman parent? Because firsthand experience means you don't have to explain yourself. Sharing common interests is integral to any friendship and this opportunity could be the beginning of beautiful friendships! Some of you may already have your Angel-supports in place but maybe you could be a mentor to a young family? Maybe you or someone you know was recently diagnosed and want to invite them to this group? Or maybe you want to be part of the “3 am” club because your kid has you up all night. This venue would allow you to find others “awake” at the same time. There might be a better forum to use than FB in that it could be set up in a more efficient way, however, this is what we have to work with. To begin, Join, Angelman Syndrome-Find a Buddy. Then add a brief post about yourself and what kind of support you would like to find. Maybe you are searching for one parent or maybe you want to form a group (of three or four), or maybe you want to find someone where you check in once a week to see how they are doing? (You might find that you are FB friends already so this would be an opportunity to get to know them better).These are just suggestions. It's up to you to decide how to proceed. I don't know if this will work but I do know that Angelman parents are a very loving and supportive community. I've been blessed to make connections with families from around the world. Having friends in multiple time zones has been awesome! This week, we will be tagging our friends to join this group. I'm afraid we may duplicate requests, if we do, please don't be annoyed. Since this is the launch, there should be a period of time for this group to build before connecting. I'd like to suggest that Buddy finding begins on September 15, 2018. Either this will be a flash of brilliance or an epic fail. Even if only a few connections are made, I'll consider this a success, however, it could be so much more. This will only work if you are willing to play. I hope you do!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4642110840359238659/She-found-her-voice-by-Chance	She found her voice by Chance	August 11, 2018 by Mary1991 7 Comments. The front and back of Jessie's new business card. Over the last three years, we have shared over 500 business cards and now we have run out. These cards were given to people who either needed information or were so curious, they'd ask questions I didn't find appropriate answering. Besides, I don't believe we should talk about someone in front of them, it's rude. With Jess's permission, the cards allow us to share her story. We needed an updated look for her card. By happenchance, this photo was taken outside of the shop, Chance on Main . Their mission statement is:. a for-purpose boutique and gallery. because sometimes all you need. is a CHANCE”. If it weren't for the founder of Chance, we might not have had a story to tell. It was late one fall when I expressed my frustrations with her that Jessie did not have a reliable way to communicate. In turn, she mentioned this to her son's therapist and their response was, “I know someone who is a whiz with computers and AAC ”, and this is how we found the app Speak for Yourself . It made perfect sense for Jess to chose a photo of her holding Lucy the bull by the horns. In essence, this is what she did in order to find her voice. If you want something bad enough, you need to take matters into your own hands. The first words Jess said to me this morning were, “I love you”. Sure, she could have expressed this in a non-verbal way, but there is nothing more powerful than hearing it said. I hope that when we share her card, not only do people take the time to learn about Angelman Syndrome but they realize how vital it is to be able to choose your own words.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692885003509974944/Xconomy:-Bio-Roundup:-Medicare-Drug-Prices,-FDA-Moves,-Gene-Therapy-News--More	Xconomy: Bio Roundup: Medicare Drug Prices, FDA Moves, Gene Therapy News & More	Bio Roundup: Medicare Drug Prices, FDA Moves, Gene Therapy News & More. August 10th, 2018. * Like Us. Xconomy National —. Two imminent FDA rulings on two separate drugs aren’t just noteworthy for the patients they’ll help, but the long and winding road their developers have taken to get to this point. First is Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which has spent 16 years and over $2 billion to try to bring an unproven form of medicine, RNA interference (RNAi), to market . A positive FDA decision, which could come by Saturday, would mark RNAi as a bona fide drug-making method, and Alnylam as its standard-bearer. Then there’s Amicus Therapeutics. The company’s on-again, off-again ambitions for FDA approval of a Fabry disease drug would make a fitting sequel to the 2010 Hollywood flick about its origins, Extraordinary Measures. The most recent twist: a drug approval made possible only because the FDA unexpectedly rescinded demands for an additional study that would have taken several years. Xconomy has documented several steps of the journey, which should wrap up by Monday with an FDA decision . In other news, Medicare Advantage plans just got a new tool to negotiate drug prices, the hemophilia gene therapy race sped up, and a New York congressman faces insider trading charges. Time to wrap up this week’s biotech saga. ON CAPITOL HILL. —Starting next year, The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will give Medicare Advantage plans, which cover about 20 million seniors in the U.S., new tools to negotiate lower drug prices for the Medicare Part B drugs given in hospitals and doctor’s offices. One of them is to initiate “step therapy,” in which patients would have to fail a cheaper treatment before moving on to a more expensive one. Here’s more from Bloomberg . —GOP Congressman Chris Collins (R-NY) and two others, including his son Cameron, were arrested and indicted on charges of insider trading in the Australian biotech Innate Immunotherapeutics. Collins denied any wrongdoing. CNBC has more. —The FDA cleared a generic version of potassium chloride for hypokalemia, which causes dangerously low potassium levels. The drug, from Athenex (NASDAQ: ATNX ), is the first to market after getting the FDA’s Competitive Generic Therapy designation , a new tool to speed the development of generics. —The agency also approved mogamulizumab-kpkc (Poteligeo), from Kyowa Kirin, to treat rare non-Hodgkin lymphomas. —The FDA also OK’d the cystic fibrosis medicine ivacaftor/lumacaftor (Orkambi), from Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDA; VRTX ), for the estimated 1,300 children between two and five years old who have the most common form of the disease. The drug is already approved for adults. —Ampio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: AMPE ) shares plunged 78 percent after the company disclosed that the FDA wants it to run another trial of its osteoarthritis drug Ampion before filing for U.S. approval. —An FDA advisory panel voted to recommend U.S. approval of omadacycline, an experimental antibiotic from Paratek Pharmaceuticals’s (NASDAQ: PRTK ), for bacterial skin infections and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The FDA could approve the drug by early October. —Nearly two months after an FDA advisory panel panned an extended-release version of oxycodone (Remoxy) from Pain Therapeutics (NASDAQ: PTIE ), the regulator rejected the drug. The Austin, TX-based will now restructure. THIS WEEK IN GENETIC MEDICINE. —Shares of Spark Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ONCE ) fell nearly 30 percent after the latest update on the company’s experimental gene therapy for hemophilia. Spark plans to move its gene therapy into Phase 3 testing, but shares fell on investors’ concerns over how it stacks up to a rival therapy from BioMarin Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ: BMRN ), STAT reports. Here’s more on the long-term questions surrounding hemophilia gene therapy . —Sangamo Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SGMO ) provided the first glimpse of human data from its experimental gene editing treatment for hemophilia A. —An experimental gene therapy from RegenxBio (NASDAQ: RGNX ) for age-related macular degeneration showed early, positive signs in a Phase 1 stud y. But an update from a second gene therapy for a genetic disease that causes high cholesterol was less encouraging. Here’s more from Forbes . — Nature published two editorials critiquing the controversial work of an Oregon researcher who used CRISPR technology to edit out a genetic mutation in human embryos. That researcher also updated the results this week. Here’s more from MIT Technology Review . DEALS & CASH GRABS. —Ambys Medicines, of Redwood City, CA, started up with a $60 million Series A and an unusual, broad alliance with Japanese pharma Takeda to develop an array of drugs for liver diseases. These early, wide-ranging partnerships between biotechs and pharma companies have previously proven too limiting for small biotechs; Xconomy spoke with CEO Jeff Tong about the pros and cons of such deals . —Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN ) invested $100 million in Bluebird Bio (NASDAQ: BLUE ) as part of an alliance to co-develop a range of cell therapies for cancer. —San Diego biotech Samumed, which is developing regenerative medicines for diseases like cancer and osteoarthritis, raised an eye-popping $438 million in its latest financing round. The privately held company is worth $12 billion. Results from a Phase 2 study in osteoarthritis will be released soon, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. —SQZ Biotechnologies closed a $72 million Series C round to continue advancing its experimental cell therapies for solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. –Boston-based Akouos raised $50 million in a Series A financing round to support work on a gene therapy for hearing loss that it hopes to advance into human testing within three years. —Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDSAQ: SRPT ) invested $30 million in privately held Lacerta Therapeutics and got an option to license up to three of the startup’s experimental gene therapies for neurological diseases. —Struggling women’s fertility company Ovascience (NASDAQ: OVAS ), which trades at less than $1 a share, will merge with privately held Millendo Therapeutics, of Ann Arbor, MI, in an all-stock deal . The combined company will be 80 percent owned by Millendo shareholders, led by Millendo CEO Julia Owens, and focus on drugs for rare endocrine disorders. —Citing disappointing “market test results,” Ironwood Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: IRWD ) ended a 2016 deal with AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN ) for the struggling gout drug lesinurad (Zurampic) and returned its rights to the drug to the British pharma. Ironwood will ax 125 employees, mostly in sales. —Shares of Ovid Therapeutics (NASDAQ: OVID ) fell 30 percent on Phase 2 results for an experimental drug for the rare disease Angelman Syndrome. The study met its main goal, safety, but the benefits of the drug so far are unclear. —Protagonist Therapeutics (NASDAQ: PTGX ) will continue developing its experimental ulcerative colitis drug PTGX-100 after an independent re-analysis of its Phase 2 data suggested “ signals of clinical efficacy ” and an error in the initial assessment in March. Shares climbed more than 30 percent. AND THE FINALISTS ARE…. —This week we profiled the finalists for Xconomy’s Newcomer , Young Innovator , and Commitment to Diversity awards.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4640181778223030676/Ovid-posts-results-from-midstage-rare-disease-test,-plots-registrational-path	Ovid posts results from midstage rare disease test, plots registrational path	Ovid Therapeutics has posted a batch of topline data out of its midstage STARS trial in Angelman syndrome as it seeks out a path to approval. The study was focused on safety and tolerability, and saw OV101 hit its primary endpoint in several of these markers, although it failed to beat out placebo in a series of subsets. The phase 2 trial was set up with 88 patients randomized across three groups: a once-daily or twice-daily dose of OV101 or placebo. Your Daily Newsletter — Free. Enjoying this story?

The biotech says that at 12 weeks of treatment, OV101 “showed a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in the physician-rated clinical global impressions of improvement (CGI-I).”. Specifically, it showed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0206; Fisher’s exact test) between the combined OV101 treatment arms and placebo. “This reflects an improvement in two-thirds of the combined treatment groups versus one-third in placebo,” the startup explained. This is a measure commonly used in a test geared to help doctors capture a series of clinical symptoms, and Ovid says that CGI-I was “ranked first in the topline statistical plan.”. RELATED:. Overall, Ovid says that the study met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability given that the adverse events (AEs) with OV101 treatment were similar to placebo. The most common AEs reported in the trial were vomiting, somnolence, irritability, aggression, and pyrexia. In addition, “subsequent analyses in the hierarchy were conducted on a prespecified subset of scales across the domains of behavior, sleep and gait.”. But the company says that the analysis of these prespecified subsets “did not show a statistically significant difference from placebo,” adding that full data analyses on these domains “are ongoing,” and they’ll get back to us on what they find in the future. The drug is seeking to treat Angelman syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that can cause delayed development, seizures, sleep problems and other medical issues. OV101 is a selective extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonist in development that can mediate tonic inhibition, a key underlying pathophysiological mechanism of Angelman syndrome. This medication, from Lundbeck and Merck, was put on the scrap heap nearly a decade ago, after the pair failed to get it through the clinic for insomnia. Ovid is hoping the new test and insights will reveal the hidden value of this once-failed drug. On the back of the STARS data, Ovid now says it “intends to discuss these data with regulatory authorities to determine the next steps for a registrational pathway” and plots to start an open-label extension study (named ELARA) in the fourth quarter. “We are excited by these data, as this is the first demonstration of positive clinical effect on overall symptomology in Angelman syndrome,” said Jeremy Levin, D.Phil., MB, BChir, chairman and chief executive of Ovid. “In collaboration with the Angelman community, we designed a robust study to evaluate prespecified endpoints that may pave the way for a registrational pathway for a disorder that has no previously approved medicines. These data are a tribute to the patients and their families and we thank them.”. “These initial data from the STARS study are encouraging, particularly the statistically significant improvement in overall symptoms that we see in the CGI-I scale in the once-daily dosing group,” said Ron Thibert, D.O., MsPH, chairperson of the STARS clinical trial steering committee, director of the Angelman syndrome clinic at Mass General Hospital for Children, and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. “Angelman syndrome is a complex disorder and the CGI-I scale captures the totality of global neurological deficits and helps to define the impact of medicines on the individual and their families. “The data reported today are the first data in Angelman syndrome to show a compound specifically targeting the syndrome having a clinical effect. Ovid is the first company to have conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in Angelman syndrome, providing important clinical and scientific data. Based on these data, I believe OV101 has the potential to offer a clinically meaningful benefit specific to people living with Angelman syndrome.”. Investors weren't feeling great about the mixed data, sending the biotech's shares down 30% in early trading.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4714499630794084116/Xconomy:-PTC-Dives-Into-Gene-Therapy-with-50M-Agilis-Biotherapeutics-Deal	Xconomy: PTC Dives Into Gene Therapy with $50M Agilis Biotherapeutics Deal	PTC Dives Into Gene Therapy with $50M Agilis Biotherapeutics Deal. July 19th, 2018. * Like Us. Xconomy New York —. PTC Therapeutics is looking to gene therapy in a bid to broaden its pipeline, scooping up privately held Agilis Biotherapeutics in a cash and stock deal . South Plainfield, NJ-based PTC (NASDAQ: PTCT ) will pay $50 million up front, plus $150 million in PTC shares, for Agilis. Agilis, based in Cambridge, MA, could get up to $595 million more depending on the progress of its three most advanced gene therapy programs, which target rare central nervous system disorders. For those payments to kick in, Agilis will need to win FDA approvals for each of those three gene therapies, and get a priority review voucher as well. The FDA awards these vouchers to companies that develop drugs for neglected diseases and rare pediatric disorders. They ensure a speedier review from the agency once a company files for approval. But these vouchers have become valuable commodities themselves, bought and sold at prices topping $100 million. PTC already focuses on rare disease treatments, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in particular. The company sells two drugs for Duchenne, ataluren (Translarna) and deflazacort (Emflaza) . Ataluren is only approved in Europe, however. PTC has failed three times to win FDA approval . Combined, the two drugs generated $174 million in sales in 2017. Agilis’ lead therapeutic candidate, GT-AADC, is an experimental treatment for Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) Deficiency, an enzyme deficiency that leads to the inability to develop motor control. AADC patients develop problems breathing and swallowing, and need life-long care. PTC says based on “long-term evidence of durable clinical benefit” from Agilis’ clinical studies, it plans to file for FDA approval next year. Three additional gene therapy candidates will come to PTC in the Agilis acquisition. AGIL-FA, an experimental treatment for the rare neurodegenerative disease Friedreich’s ataxia, could start clinical trials next year. AGIL-AS, a potential gene therapy for the rare neurological disorder Angelman syndrome, and AGIL-RLN, a potential treatment for unspecified cognitive disorders, are still in preclinical development. If the gene therapies for Friedreich’s ataxia and Angelman syndrome reach the market, Agilis shareholders would get another $150 million, plus 2 to 6 percent of the net sales of the drugs, according to the agreement. PTC and Agilis expect the acquisition to close later this quarter. The deal has already been approved by the boards of both companies.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4602543128140867774/Role-of-UBE3A-enzyme-in-Angelman-syndrome	Role of UBE3A enzyme in Angelman syndrome	April 20, 2018. The group, led by the Ikerbasque professor Ugo Mayor of the UPV/EHU's Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, has just published in the journal Human Molecular Genetics an explanation of the mechanisms affected by Angelman syndrome. Thanks to an innovative, experimental design and the state-of-the-art infrastructure of the UPV/EHU's General Proteomics Research Service, they have managed to identify the changes in the proteins altered by the UBE3A enzyme, the malfunctioning of which in the brain leads to the disease. According to these new results, UBE3A is responsible for regulating the function of proteasome, a kind of shredding machine that regulates the balance of the other proteins in the cells. In this indirect way, UBE3A is responsible for the stability of a huge number of processes that take place within the cells. When there is a fault in the UBE3A, these processes do not take place correctly. This explains the complexity of the syndrome that emerges when the UBE3A enzyme fails to perform its function properly. The genetic origin and symptoms of this disease have been studied previously, but until now no explanation has been forthcoming as to how a single gene was capable of creating so many alternations in brain function. Angelman syndrome is a disease affecting one in every 15,000 newborn babies. It causes complex problems in the intellectual development of children, epilepsy, as well as difficulties in communicating, lack of motor coordination and problems in balance and movement accompanied by extremely few hours of sleep. All this is caused by the failure in the brain of a single gene: UBE3A.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4600801362658725557/Genomic-Imprinting	Genomic Imprinting	By Shelley Farrar Stoakes, MSc, BSc. In diploid organisms, two copies of a gene are inherited − one from the mother and one from the father. For most genes, both alleles are expressed, but in a small subset, only one of the copies are expressed whilst the other is inactive. This is termed genomic imprinting. Credit: Yurchanka Siarhei/Shutterstock.com. Genomic imprinting means that specific genes inherited from the mother or father are active, whilst the gene inherited from the other parent is inactive. This preferential expression of one allele is important for normal development. Genomic imprinting is found in all mammals and investigation of this process has been aided by the presence of many conserved imprinted genes between mice and humans. Genomic imprinting and development. The role of genomic imprinting in development was first noted in uniparental mouse embryo studies. Embryos derived from two paternal pronuclei were found to lack embryonic tissues whilst the embryos derived from two maternal pronuclei developed without extraembryonic tissues. This indicated that imprinted genes with preferential expression of one inherited allele (either paternal or maternal), were central to normal development. The paternally expressed IGF2 gene was one of the first imprinted genes to be identified as a positive regulator of fetal growth. Interestingly, it’s expression is controlled by the maternally imprinted IGF2R gene. Imprinted genes also have an important role in neural development and function. Genomic imprinting provides unique gene expression in the brain that is separate from patterns seen in other tissues. One example is the UBE3A gene where both copies are expressed in most tissues but only the maternal copy is expressed in brain tissue where it promotes neural plasticity. Some imprinted genes are associated with specific neuronal subtypes that assist in the establishing diverse cell types within the brain tissue. Imprinting mechanisms. Genomic imprinting occurs through the marking of a gene during gamete production via different epigenetic mechanisms. Two major mechanisms by which genes are imprinted are DNA methylation and histone modifications. During DNA methylation, a methyl group is added to a segment of DNA and is employed in the identification of a maternal or paternal allele. The epigenetic process alters gene expression through imprinting without altering the DNA sequence. Histone modifications alter the chromatin structure leading to changes in gene expression. There are numerous modifications that can be applied to the histone for imprinting including histone acetylation, which forms an accessible chromatin formation, and histone deacetylation leading to compressed chromatin. After fertilization, specific imprints from each parent must be maintained during genome reprogramming. The final stage of genomic imprinting involves the erasure of the somatic pattern of biparental imprints. Genomic imprinting and disease inheritance. Some diseases occur as a result of deletions or mutations in imprinted genes. Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome were the first reported diseases associated with genomic imprinting in humans. The diseases have distinct symptoms though they are both caused by a deletion in the same region of chromosome 15. This is because the parental origin of the affected chromosome differs between the two syndromes. Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by the loss of paternally inherited genes whilst Angelman syndrome is caused by the loss of maternally inherited genes. The loss of paternally imprinted genes can occur because of unipaternal disomy, in this case where two copies of the maternal chromosome are inherited. In contrast, Angelman syndrome occurs through the loss of the single maternally expressed gene UBE3A within brain tissue. Genomic imprinting is also associated with the formation of certain cancers. A type of embryonic kidney cancer called Wilm’s tumor is associated with the loss of imprinting for two specific genes. In normal embryonic kidney cells, the imprinted maternal copy of H19 is expressed that has a growth suppression function along with the imprinted paternal copy of IGF2, a known growth factor. In Wilm’s tumor cells the imprinting of H19 and IGF2 is lost, meaning that the lack of H19 function causes an overexpression of IGF2 resulting in tumorigenesis. Reviewed by P Surat, PhD.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4603094513892415222/Mary1991	Mary1991	When I started writing, three and a half years ago, there weren’t many blogs about young adults with Angelman Syndrome . It seemed once your child aged out of school, they might as well have dropped off the face of the planet. I wanted to know, what happens next? So, I started writing about Jess, an older Angel, hoping that something I said would help another parent. By sharing our journey, the mistakes, the lessons, and the success, maybe, just maybe someone else would benefit. In our own way, we have been trying to pave a way. At one time, there was little expectation for the Down Syndrome community. However, the parents pushed and questioned what they had been told was possible. By presuming competence and raising expectations, the perception with regards to abilities morphed into “anything is possible”. I believe the Angelman Community is following a similar path. When Jess was finally given the correct diagnosis (at 13), she was taken off the educational track and the focus was on self-help skills. This was done with my knowledge, however, I was naive. I didn’t realize why the change until years later. I didn’t realize that the diagnosis caused the shift. I dumbly followed schools lead believing they had her best interest at heart. Because communication is the foundation for learning, my main focus for this blog has been about AAC . These are the bullet points that you need to know:. 1. if you child isn’t able to communicate, you can ask the school for help, but most likely, you will need to research AAC apps and devices yourself. Be aware that SLP’s are not created equal and are not required to take courses in Augmentative and Alternative Communication. They learn after they graduate, on the job and many do this on their own time. Where once speech was about articulation, there’s a growing need for SLP’s to be versed in AAC technology. 2. When asking for supports from school, put it in writing. They will kindly blow smoke up your butt making you believe action is taking place when it is not. Requests do not exist unless it is in writing. 3. AAC evals are only as good as the person giving the evaluation. A two-week trial isn’t enough to know if the AAC is a match. 4. If you succeed in getting an AAC device, insist that it comes home with the child. Consider the device a voice prosthesis. A child wouldn’t leave a wheelchair at school and come home without one and they shouldn’t leave their voice at school either. 5. Ask for training, not just at school, but in the home too. You need to know how to support your child. How can they be successful with an AAC app unless you are able to model comfortably? You can’t just hand the child a device and expect them to talk and they especially need someone to talk to. 6. Get the whole family involved. Get your friends involved. Have your child out in the community using their Talker. Share with those that have never seen an AAC app in action so they understand this is your child’s voice and not a toy. Not only will this help your child but will make your child’s world bigger because it will encourage acceptance. 7. There is no such thing as too old to learn. For Jess to have a voice and the ability to speak for herself has been life-changing. If you are reading this and are waiting for school, do me a favor. Stop talking for an hour or two and try and communicate to your family. Or go out into the community and try and get help. You will learn quickly how difficult it is to not have a voice. So how old is your child that isn’t talking, seven, twelve, eighteen? Do you think you could be as patient without a voice as they are? If they’re acting out, then they have given you their opinion. If they aren’t responding, maybe they have given up. Jess was a combination of both. We are trying to make up for that now. It’s the best we can do. The point is, don’t wait for school. I guess I’m writing about this because I’m frustrated. It saddens me when I learn schools do not follow through and let time go by. Either it is due to ignorance or because they want to save their district money. This I know because I’ve had many teachers pull me aside over the years saying such. They’d share with me their concerns and how the administration has constrained them. I realize our schools are overwhelmed, however, you have to be the squeaky wheel. Unfortunately, I didn’t learn all of this until Jess was about to age out of school. I was ignorant about how technology was changing, however, the SFY app wasn’t available to Jess when she was eight (though that first device worked initially, it soon became apparent it didn’t meet her needs). I shudder to think what Jess’s life would have been like if we hadn’t found her voice when she turned 21. Fortunately, no child should have to wait that long anymore. PS- I forgot to mention, even though I was labeled “that over-involved parent” and teachers were “warned” about me (told to me recently by one of Jess’s teachers), I didn’t buck the system till her last two years of school.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4603247884561494096/News-|	News |	By Amberley Romo. It’s now been almost five years since I first wrote about future planning . I was 22, and living in Washington, DC — 1,300 miles away from my family in Dallas. At the time, my sister Caroline was 18. We were both entering new phases of our lives. I was fresh out of college, and she had just reached legal adulthood. (Her birthday milestones honestly were always more striking to me than my own). Caroline was born with a rare neuro-genetic disorder called Angelman syndrome . The prevalence of AS is estimated to be somewhere between 1/12,000 and 1/24,000. I was in third grade when we finally discovered my sister’s diagnosis. I know, because my mom tells the story of how I went to school, and told my third grade teacher that I was worried about how I would take care of Caroline when something happened to our parents. Years later, when my parents took our family out to dinner to celebrate my high school graduation, I have a perfect memory of sitting at the table feeling deeply guilty, and near tears. I was soon to move to DC for college. At the table, my parents expressed how important they thought it was that I go. When I later moved away to college, it was deeply unsettling for about a semester. Everything I had to do every day suddenly only revolved around, well, me. The years passed, and I thrived in DC. I love that city. It’s my home away from home. But I felt those tugs. Sometimes the feeling was quiet, sometimes it was loud; but it was there. Feeling too far away, feeling too selfish. Feeling the desire to be a present fixture in the lives of my family members — to be a more active part of Caroline’s care network. I’m now almost 28; she is almost 24. I lived in DC for eight years. Two years ago, I moved back to Texas. For one of those years, I lived in Dallas. It’s hard to explain the internal battle between feelings of obligation and not knowing with any certainty what you really want, personally. But you know what I’m talking about. It’s part of the human experience. It has nothing specifically to do with having a sibling with disabilities. It’s a universal experience. This is just a particularly salient part of how I experience this struggle. None of us can know if we’re making the right choices; We just do what we can, and keep moving forward. What I can say with certainty is that living in closer proximity to my sister deepened our connection considerably. When living further away, I could still say hi to her on the phone. (Or like when she somehow figured out how to FaceTime with me while I was at work and she was in class). But living back home, she would spend the night over at my apartment. We’d make dinner, and watch The Great British Baking Show. She loves to watch my pet rabbits run around. I got back in sync with her nonverbal cues, and she got back in sync with my micro-movements. (I swear to you she can tell when you’ve had a thought, and haven’t even said anything yet — her emotional intelligence is through the roof). It’s these subtleties that were difficult — near impossible, even — to maintain, in a long-distance relationship with her. There’s no right decision for me, or for other siblings. But I can say for certain that I don’t regret moving back to be closer. I was reflecting on these past ten years just recently; I was doing some work in a coffee shop, and a family came in. A mom, dad, older sister and younger brother. The younger brother had Down syndrome. They were all hanging his art on the coffee shop wall. As I understand it, the sister had independently reached out to the coffee shop about featuring her brother’s work, and the other artist currently featured on the wall had volunteered to share space. As I chatted with them, and watched as they arranged his art, I had an odd sense of deja vu. Reflecting on being the sister’s age, and pondering college. (She appeared to perhaps be in high school). These thoughts can feel so isolating, but they are such a deeply shared experience. Meeting them by happenstance reminded me of that. Growing up feels like continuously uncovering that behind the tapestry is a mess of loose ends. From chaos, comes order (or at least hindsight). When I was younger, I worried about Caroline’s future with a general sense of anxiety. Now that I’m older, I worry about increasingly complicated specifics. We have been having active planning conversations for years, and on some level, it grinds away in the back of my brain nonstop. Despite working so proactively, we still don’t feel close to having an answer, or feeling prepared. I hope that for anyone reading this, these thoughts inspire thoughtfulness, not paralysis. I accept that we can’t ever know anything for certain. It can be overwhelming, but I fervently hope that other siblings and families don’t shy away from these conversations.

The Arc and Walmart Foundation Renew Commitment to Providing Community-Based Employment For People With Disabilities. Posted on April 3, 2018 by The Arc. Washington, DC – The Arc’s employment program, The Arc@Work, is pleased to announce it has received a $325,000, one-year grant from the Walmart Foundation. This funding will be dedicated toward scaling the programs that The Arc@Work and Walmart have created over the past two years to train and place people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) in competitive, integrated employment within their communities. Employment rates for people with disabilities – especially people with I/DD – are critically low compared to people without disabilities. The US Census Bureau’s American Communities Survey (2015) estimates that people with any disability or a cognitive disability are employed at much lower rates (34.3% and 24.8% respectively) than those without disabilities (73.6%). Additionally, the National Core Indicators Survey of 2015-2016 reported that 19% of people with I/DD in the workforce reported having a paid job in the community. In response to these dire statistics, through funding from the Walmart Foundation, The Arc@Work has built a successful partnership in working with local chapters of The Arc to provide competitive and community-based employment opportunities and strengthening chapters’ relationships with local businesses since 2016. To do this, The Arc@Work provides technical assistance and an average sub-grant award of $10,000 to chapters of The Arc located across the country that provide community-based employment opportunities. Over this two-year span, the Walmart Foundation has supported The Arc@Work and chapters of The Arc located across the country in training more than 2,000 individuals and placing more than 800 individuals into competitive and community-based jobs. Additionally, participating chapters of The Arc have forged relationships with nearly 500 local and regional employers to provide trained job candidates and staff training on creating inclusive work environments. This new round of funding will allow for The Arc@Work and chapters of The Arc to achieve even greater impact over the next year. “For far too long, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities have been relegated to the margins of the working world. Along with private initiatives, new government regulations promise to dramatically increase the number of people with disabilities placed alongside of people without disabilities in integrated, competitive environments. The support from the Walmart Foundation will allow The Arc to continue to transform the existing pool of talented candidates with disabilities into productive employees,” said Peter Berns, CEO of The Arc. The Arc advocates for and serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD), including Down syndrome, autism, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, cerebral palsy and other diagnoses. The Arc has a network of over 650 chapters across the country promoting and protecting the human rights of people with I/DD and actively supporting their full inclusion and participation in the community throughout their lifetimes and without regard to diagnosis.

Posted on March 30, 2018 by The Arc. The Arc Wisconsin celebrates a major victory in Wisconsin, the passage of a ground-breaking Employment First bill that will hold state agencies accountable to update and improve policies, set benchmarks and report on their progress to increase the number of people with disabilities in Wisconsin working in competitive integrated employment. One of The Arc Wisconsin’s leading advocates for this legislation was Ashley Mathy of Rhinelander who has autism. In recognition of Wisconsin’s progress and Autism Acceptance Month, Ashley shares with us in her own words why this new law is so important to her and the thousands of people with disabilities in Wisconsin. By Ashley Mathy. Ashley Mathy from Wisconsin, who has autism, stands with Governor Scott Walker after he signed the state’s Employment First law on March 28. Hello, I am Ashley Mathy a self-advocate who has PDD, NOS (Autism spectrum). I have a simple answer to a question. The question is “When?”. Before I answer, please consider- as you know, the month of April is Autism Acceptance month. Education and awareness of Autism are so important to me personally because of my daily struggles with anxiety, social challenges and much more. So many people look at autism behaviors as strange versus accepting the person and all the wonderful gifts and abilities we can offer this world. On the positive side my challenges with Autism have given me the personal experience needed to share my stories, challenges and successes with so many people. Throughout this journey, it has made me realize that Autism doesn’t define me…it is just a word. The truth is I am a fighter. I am a warrior. I am a leader. I am a friend. I am a daughter. Doctors and teachers believed that I would not be able to work in the community and college would not be a likely option. I have proven doctors and teachers wrong by showing them I can overcome any obstacle that is put in front of me. I believe that you never know how strong you are unless you are put to the test…Autism was my test. Christopher Robin says: “You’re are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think” and who can argue with a Winnie the Pooh expert!! Today, I assist in the Dean’s office at Nicolet College, speak around the State of Wisconsin for disability advocacy and market Soap Sisters which stands for “Sister of Autism Princess”, (a company that my sister and I started) and take classes at Nicolet College. Ashley shared her employment story with many state legislators, including Representative James Edming pictured in this photo in the Wisconsin Capitol, to help get Wisconsin’s law passed. I am so proud and excited to be part of promoting the Employment First Law . Integrated employment for people with disabilities is by far my biggest advocacy goal. I personally know so many people with special needs that want to work AND contribute to their community, PLUS they want to make a positive impact in this world. We have so many talents they we can bring to the table such as being a reliable employee, positive can-do attitude and very hard worker. People with disabilities have that “fire” to get the job done to the best of their abilities while making every attempt to overcome any obstacles in a job. Personally, I struggled with finding the right job for my skills and abilities. I got caught between the priorities of all the agencies helping me find a job. After much determination, I found several jobs that are a perfect fit for me. With the passage of the Employment First bill, the agencies will be required to work together and develop a joint plan with the same goal in mind; securing employment for people with special needs. This teamwork will be a powerful tool for Wisconsin to move forward and for individuals to take their rightful place in the community and workforce. I believe the key to success in life is everyone working together towards the same common goal. The passage of this Employment First Bill and the determination of people with special needs along with the support of employers and agencies… will make a difference in lives, and ensure a WIN- TOGETHER! The answer to the question of, “When?”. My simple answer is, NOW- RIGHT NOW. Posted in Advocacy |. Tagged Autism Acceptance Month , Employment , Wisconsin. The Arc Joins Effort Calling on Department of Education to Keep Guidance on Treating All Students Fairly, including Students with Disabilities. Posted on March 23, 2018 by The Arc. The Arc has joined more than 140 national, state, and local organizations, led by The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, in a letter calling on the U.S. Department of Education (ED) to keep in place school discipline guidance. This guidance merely clarifies that the ED expects that schools and districts are treating all children fairly and provides practical tools and guidelines for educators to create safe, supportive, and welcoming environments for all students. In 2014, the federal guidance was issued with documents that provide important information and support for educators who want to create safer and more welcoming schools and important cautions for schools where problems of unequal treatment are not being addressed. The Arc and the organizations signing this letter maintain that rescinding the guidance would send the opposite message: that the ED does not care that schools are discriminating against children of color by disproportionately removing them from school and that ED does not see itself as having a role in helping educators create and maintain safe schools that afford all students equal educational opportunities. “We know that suspensions and expulsions have been used for far too long and too often in our schools and are used disproportionately against children of color and children with disabilities. This federal guidance helps to stop this trend, and rescinding it would harm the progress we have to make to live up to our commitment to a free and appropriate public education for minority students with disabilities,” said Peter Berns, CEO, The Arc.

This is just a particularly salient part of how I experience this struggle. None of us can know if we’re making the right choices; We just do what we can, and keep moving forward. What I can say with certainty is that living in closer proximity to my sister deepened our connection considerably. When living further away, I could still say hi to her on the phone. (Or like when she somehow figured out how to FaceTime with me while I was at work and she was in class). But living back home, she would spend the night over at my apartment. We’d make dinner, and watch The Great British Baking Show. She loves to watch my pet rabbits run around. I got back in sync with her nonverbal cues, and she got back in sync with my micro-movements. (I swear to you she can tell when you’ve had a thought, and haven’t even said anything yet — her emotional intelligence is through the roof). It’s these subtleties that were difficult — near impossible, even — to maintain, in a long-distance relationship with her. There’s no right decision for me, or for other siblings. But I can say for certain that I don’t regret moving back to be closer. I was reflecting on these past ten years just recently; I was doing some work in a coffee shop, and a family came in. A mom, dad, older sister and younger brother. The younger brother had Down syndrome. They were all hanging his art on the coffee shop wall. As I understand it, the sister had independently reached out to the coffee shop about featuring her brother’s work, and the other artist currently featured on the wall had volunteered to share space. As I chatted with them, and watched as they arranged his art, I had an odd sense of deja vu. Reflecting on being the sister’s age, and pondering college. (She appeared to perhaps be in high school). These thoughts can feel so isolating, but they are such a deeply shared experience. Meeting them by happenstance reminded me of that. Growing up feels like continuously uncovering that behind the tapestry is a mess of loose ends. From chaos, comes order (or at least hindsight). When I was younger, I worried about Caroline’s future with a general sense of anxiety. Now that I’m older, I worry about increasingly complicated specifics. We have been having active planning conversations for years, and on some level, it grinds away in the back of my brain nonstop. Despite working so proactively, we still don’t feel close to having an answer, or feeling prepared. I hope that for anyone reading this, these thoughts inspire thoughtfulness, not paralysis. I accept that we can’t ever know anything for certain. It can be overwhelming, but I fervently hope that other siblings and families don’t shy away from these conversations.

Joe Damiano Says #HandsOff – Learn His Tips for Effective Advocacy. Posted on March 14, 2018 by The Arc. This is a new series at The Arc Blog called #HandsOff. Each month, we feature a story from individuals and families across The Arc’s network about how some of today’s key policy issues impact their day to day lives. Meet Joe Damiano! Joe is 23 years old and is a very active advocate in his home state of New York. Joe is the outreach director for The Arc’s National Council of Self-Advocates, a board member for a local non-profit, and the former chair of a self-advocacy group called the Collaborative of New York. For the last several years, Joe has attended the Disability Policy Seminar in Washington, DC and participates in the lobby day to meet with his Members of Congress and talk about issues that are important to people with disabilities. Here is what Joe had to say about his advocacy and his advice for others who want to get involved to tell Congress #HandsOff important programs:. How did you get involved in advocacy? What is your favorite part of being an advocate? I’ve been doing advocacy my whole life! Once of my favorite examples of my advocacy work is when I was about 16, my dad took me to Albany, to the state capitol in New York to advocate for a bill to stop using the “r” word. It really resonated with me as a person with a disability. I heard that word in school a lot and I didn’t want people to use it anymore. My favorite part in general is attending learning sessions like at the Disability Policy Seminar so I can learn about the latest issues. My favorite part about meeting with legislators is getting my point across. Why do you think it’s important for people with disabilities to be strong advocates for programs like Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)? Programs like Medicaid and SSI help people with disabilities. Sometimes these programs are people’s only lifeline. They pretty much can’t live without it. It helps them to be independent. If Congress takes these programs away, many people will be impacted. If you’re not an advocate, those benefits may get taken away. What advice do you have for self-advocates who want to get started in advocacy? The first thing and the biggest thing, I would say, is find your local self-advocacy group. Self-advocacy groups can help you with tips on how to present to your legislators and how to get your message across, give you a chance to go to lobby days, and opportunities to meet with your legislators. They really help. You can learn about upcoming meetings for The Arc’s National Council of Self Advocates here . What tips do you have for self-advocates meeting with their legislators for the first time? I made a presentation with tips for self-advocates meeting with their legislators. You can see it here . One of the biggest things you have to do is have a group discussion, with whoever you are going with, to identify the issues you want to bring up at the meeting. It’s always good to invite other people to be part of the process, as long as they are people who support you. It’s always good to have other people be involved. Be clear on what you what you want the legislator to achieve and make sure you have stories on that topic. Sometimes you meet with a legislator or aide that don’t understand the issues or that we have disabilities – you just have to be patient and educate them.

Posted on March 12, 2018 by The Arc. The Arc has joined over 570 organizations, led by the National Fair Housing Alliance, calling on U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Dr. Ben Carson to retain references to creating “inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination” in the agency’s mission statement. Last week, 164 national organizations – including The Arc – and 409 state and local groups sent a letter to Secretary Carson following news accounts alleging that HUD is contemplating amending its mission statement to remove this language. “Across the United States, people with disabilities face a crisis when it comes to inclusive, affordable, and accessible housing in the community. Discrimination continues to be a major barrier: over half of fair housing claims filed in 2017 involved discrimination on the basis of disability. Many people with disabilities also face multiple barriers to housing based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, and religion, or familial status. “The Arc has been alarmed by recent news reports that HUD may be considering removing anti-discrimination language from its mission statement. We hope this is not the case. Removing this language would send the wrong message. We call on Secretary Carson to keep inclusion and freedom from discrimination front and center in all of HUD’s work, and to retain this important anti-discrimination language in HUD’s mission statement,” said Marty Ford, Senior Executive Officer, Public Policy, The Arc.

Washington, DC – The Arc is pleased to announce that its national employment program, The Arc@Work, has received an additional $122,000 over the next two years from the Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation to support its ongoing efforts to expand its partner program with Specialisterne®. The Arc@Work and Specialisterne®’s program consists of a four-week intensive training curriculum and on-the-job training designed to equip people with autism with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in entry-level IT jobs. Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation previously supported this project of The Arc with $105,000 in funding from 2015-2017. The Arc has a partnership with Specialisterne USA®, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization established by a Danish nonprofit organization, The Specialist People Foundation, that works to create meaningful employment for people with autism and similar challenges in the technology sector. The program engages top companies with IT needs interested in hiring young adults with ASD and pairs them with chapters of The Arc that provide the four-week training course, during which participants learn the basics about programming and data management while also improving soft skills. At the end of training, participants are hired into partner organizations as developers, programmers, analysts, and administrators. Employers also receive training on supporting employees with ASD and The Arc@Work and Specialisterne® work together to provide follow-up support for program participants. Chapters of The Arc in Philadelphia and New York were among the first to adopt the Specialisterne program in 2014, but the program has since been adopted by chapters in Tampa Bay and Washington, DC as well. The 2018-2019 grant from Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation will allow The Arc to expand this crucial program to new regions throughout the country. “Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation is committed to empowering young people with disabilities,” said Keijiro Hora, President of the Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation and CEO and President, Mitsubishi Electric US, Inc. “By continuing to support The Arc’s expansion of the. Specialisterne employment model, we hope to see increased numbers of young people with autism empowered to enter the competitive workforce and live productive lives,” continued Hora. The program emphasizes that many young adults with ASD are qualified to work in highly skilled positions and, with employer commitment and support, they can thrive in community-based jobs of their choosing. “There are many young people with ASD that possess the skills that are in high demand in the tech industry. This program plays matchmaker, and through our chapter network, we can not only connect a population we serve with employment in the community but also raise awareness in a major industry about what people with disabilities can do. It’s an exciting initiative and we are thrilled to have the Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation’s ongoing support,” said Peter Berns, CEO of The Arc. The Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation , based in the Washington, DC area, was established in 1991 by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and the Mitsubishi Electric U.S. companies, which produce, sell and distribute a wide range of consumer, industrial, commercial and professional electronics products. The foundation has contributed more than $15 million to organizations that are empowering young people with disabilities to lead more inclusive and productive lives.

Scranton, Pennsylvania already has a claim to fame as the setting for the TV show “The Office.” Now, The Arc of Northeastern Pennsylvania in Scranton is getting its own name out to the public by collaborating in community events honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and creating public service announcements. The Arc of Northeastern Pennsylvania (NEPA) was awarded a MLK Day of Service* grant for 2017. The city of Scranton has long recognized Dr. King’s commitment to service through the Greater Scranton MLK Commission, which promotes Dr. King’s principles of non-violence, equity and love through education and service. Every year, The Greater Scranton MLK Commission plans a full schedule of programs and special events that honor Dr. King’s life and legacy during the MLK Jr. holiday weekend. This year, The Arc of NEPA saw a fantastic opportunity to add to Dr. King’s vision for a more inclusive world and reached out to the commission to plan a food drive for families in need. On January 16, 2017, The Arc of NEPA and the United Neighborhood Centers of Northeastern Pennsylvania co-led a food drive to benefit Angel’s Attic Food Bank. The food drive brought together participants from the United Neighborhood Centers and University of Scranton, volunteers from the Aktion Club, a community service group of adults with I/DD; and The Arc Responds, a group of employees from The Arc NEPA who raise funds to help people in the community. After the Martin Luther King, Jr. weekend, Aktion club members became part of the regular volunteer corps at Angel’s Attic Food Bank, sorting and delivering food two to three times each week. Their efforts were much appreciated in a community where hunger is a significant problem— nearly 22.1% of Scranton families live in poverty according to 2016 US Census data . The Aktion Club is truly helping to make The Arc NEPA a name in giving back . To help spread the name further, the chapter has also created public service announcements for its NEPA Gives Back Campaign to show how people with I/DD and The Arc NEPA contributes to their neighborhood. One PSA features the Angel’s Attic volunteers and the good work they do in their community. In time, we hope that The Arc of NEPA’s name will become as common in Scranton as “Dunder Mifflin.”. For more on inclusive volunteering and how disability organizations can build partnerships that serve community needs and strengthen The Arc’s presence in the community, visit http://www.thearc.org/inclusive-volunteering . *In 2015, The Arc was selected by the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) , the federal agency that leads the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service , to plan and execute volunteer projects that unite Americans in service for the MLK Day of Service and throughout the year. To date, 16 chapters of The Arc around the country have organized inclusive volunteer service projects where people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) volunteer alongside people without disabilities to provide food to people in their communities who are in need. In total, these projects have brought together over 1,000 volunteers to serve more than 14,000 people in need. Posted in Programs and Supports |.

Washington, DC – Earlier this month, the President’s Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities (PCPID) released the 2017 report “ America’s Direct Support Workforce Crisis: Effects on People with Intellectual Disabilities, Families, Communities and the U.S. Economy ”. The Arc released the following statement in response to the report:. “Direct support professionals play a vital role in the lives of people with intellectual disability and their families, yet as this report outlines, we are facing a crisis when it comes to recruitment and retention in this essential field. These highly skilled workers allow many individuals with intellectual disability to live, work, and learn in the community and lead self-directed lives. But increasingly, our community is losing these vital workers to higher-paying, less demanding jobs where proper training and competitive benefits are provided. “Nationally the shortage of direct support professionals is a priority initiative for The Arc and our chapter network. We are grateful that this report not only sheds light on this growing epidemic but also offers tangible solutions to the Trump Administration. As this crisis continues, individuals with intellectual disability and their families face uncertainty and anxiety. The Arc and our chapter network remain a resource as we work to address this crisis nationally, but we encourage prompt and immediate action,” said Peter V. Berns, CEO of The Arc and member of PCPID. The Arc’s Direct Support Professional (DSP) Toolkit is highlighted in the report. The toolkit was created to support chapters of The Arc with DSP retention and recruitment. This tool was developed and used in pilot demonstrations conducted by the Research and Training Center on Community Living at the University of Minnesota.

The Arc Responds to House Passage of the Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Education and Reform Act. Posted on February 15, 2018 by The Arc. Washington, DC – Today, the House of Representatives passed HR 620, the Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Education and Reform Act, a bill that would create additional requirements for filing lawsuits under the ADA. The Arc released the following statement in response to the passage of the bill:. “Individuals with disabilities have faced decades of discrimination, abuse, segregation, and neglect which the ADA was designed to help counter. This sham of a bill weakens the civil rights protections people with disabilities rely on and undermines the opportunities for inclusion made possible by the ADA. The disregard that the authors and supporters of this bill have shown for people with disabilities is an assault on civil rights and an attack on citizens with disabilities. “Our nation leads the world in respecting and valuing the lives of people with disabilities, fighting tirelessly to promote their rights through landmark legislation like the ADA. This bill is the first step in a dangerous direction and it is unknown where it may lead us. To erase decades of progress is a shameful betrayal of our nation’s values. While there is not a Senate version of this bill yet, we call on our Senators to do the right thing and oppose any attempts to roll back the protections of the ADA. They are our last line of defense against this attack on the civil rights of individuals with disabilities in America,” said Peter Berns, CEO of The Arc. If HR 620 becomes law, a person with a disability who is denied access to a business would have to send a letter notifying the business that it is inaccessible and out of compliance with the ADA. The business would then have 60 days to respond and 120 days to make “substantial progress” toward fixing the problem. Only if the business failed to acknowledge the notification or make substantial progress in fixing the violation, could the business be sued. This shift in responsibility for a law that has been on the books for more than 27 years is unacceptable. Complicating and lengthening the notification requirement, thereby restricting the rights of all people with disabilities to have the ADA enforced, further delays their access to and participation in their communities. HR 620 was drafted in response to concerns about a small number of individuals who have filed ADA lawsuits for financial gain. It is important to note, however, that no monetary damages are available under the ADA; rather, damages are provided under state laws. Thus, HR 620 simply does not solve the problem it is intended to address. It’s only real impact is to dissuade and delay people with disabilities from enforcing their right to be free from discrimination. Excessive lawsuits filed for attorney fees should be addressed through other means aimed at the unscrupulous attorneys involved, not by diminishing the rights of people with disabilities.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4620051343050613886/About-You-Dont-Say	About “You Don’t Say”	You Don’t Say…. July 2014. This blog is about how our Angelman Syndrome (AS), daughter is finding her voice. Jessie is using a brilliant AAC App called Speak for Yourself (SFY). Little did we know at the time how SFY would change the path of her life. Communication is the motivator for so many things. Unfortunately, during the early years, Jessie’s body failed her and seizures were a major interruption. Even though we could see the light was bright in her eyes, we were held at arm’s length due to the effects of Angelman Syndrome. Her educational path was one long plateau. At the beginning of every school year, I would explain to the new teacher that Jess’s receptive language was good, and to please treat her accordingly. Nearly all of her teachers had the same forced smile, glassy-eyed look when we shared insights about our daughter. By the time Back to School night arrived, the teacher had a completely different demeanor and would excitedly tell us how much Jessie understands! My response was “you don’t say!”. Why is it that we quickly judge people based on their package? Unfortunately, Jess learned how to manipulate people. She understood how things should work, but she couldn’t get her body to cooperate. She learned it was easier, as well as amusing, to manage people’s expectations of her. At the time, she couldn’t even isolate a finger or say a word. Of course, all of this has changed. Paperwork, it never ends; Jessie as Snow White and our little cowgirl. We have been fortunate to find professionals that have taken a personal interest in Jess. We learned that just because she failed at something didn’t mean the door was closed. It just meant we needed to give it time and try again. We also learned that just because you do everything “right” doesn’t mean you get the result you want. The most important thing we learned was to not give up. You can’t find a new path if you start off feeling defeated. Finally, doctors and teachers can only tell you what they presently see. No one could have predicted the path that she is on now. She has a long way to go, but this is a marathon, not a sprint. Now that you are here and if you want to read a little more, this will take you to some of my favorite posts. 	1	1	About|“|You|Don|’|t|Say|”	You|Don|’|t|Say|…|.|July|2014|.|This|blog|is|about|how|our|Angelman|Syndrome|(|AS|)|,|daughter|is|finding|her|voice|.|Jessie|is|using|a|brilliant|AAC|App|called|Speak|for|Yourself|(|SFY|)|.|Little|did|we|know|at|the|time|how|SFY|would|change|the|path|of|her|life|.|Communication|is|the|motivator|for|so|many|things|.|Unfortunately|,|during|the|early|years|,|Jessie|’|s|body|failed|her|and|seizures|were|a|major|interruption|.|Even|though|we|could|see|the|light|was|bright|in|her|eyes|,|we|were|held|at|arm|’|s|length|due|to|the|effects|of|Angelman|Syndrome|.|Her|educational|path|was|one|long|plateau|.|At|the|beginning|of|every|school|year|,|I|would|explain|to|the|new|teacher|that|Jess|’|s|receptive|language|was|good|,|and|to|please|treat|her|accordingly|.|Nearly|all|of|her|teachers|had|the|same|forced|smile|,|glassy-eyed|look|when|we|shared|insights|about|our|daughter|.|By|the|time|Back|to|School|night|arrived|,|the|teacher|had|a|completely|different|demeanor|and|would|excitedly|tell|us|how|much|Jessie|understands|!|My|response|was|“|you|don|’|t|say|!|”|.|Why|is|it|that|we|quickly|judge|people|based|on|their|package|?|Unfortunately|,|Jess|learned|how|to|manipulate|people|.|She|understood|how|things|should|work|,|but|she|couldn|’|t|get|her|body|to|cooperate|.|She|learned|it|was|easier|,|as|well|as|amusing|,|to|manage|people|’|s|expectations|of|her|.|At|the|time|,|she|couldn|’|t|even|isolate|a|finger|or|say|a|word|.|Of|course|,|all|of|this|has|changed|.|Paperwork|,|it|never|ends|;|Jessie|as|Snow|White|and|our|little|cowgirl|.|We|have|been|fortunate|to|find|professionals|that|have|taken|a|personal|interest|in|Jess|.|We|learned|that|just|because|she|failed|at|something|didn|’|t|mean|the|door|was|closed|.|It|just|meant|we|needed|to|give|it|time|and|try|again|.|We|also|learned|that|just|because|you|do|everything|“|right|”|doesn|’|t|mean|you|get|the|result|you|want|.|The|most|important|thing|we|learned|was|to|not|give|up|.|You|can|’|t|find|a|new|path|if|you|start|off|feeling|defeated|.|Finally|,|doctors|and|teachers|can|only|tell|you|what|they|presently|see|.|No|one|could|have|predicted|the|path|that|she|is|on|now|.|She|has|a|long|way|to|go|,|but|this|is|a|marathon|,|not|a|sprint|.|Now|that|you|are|here|and|if|you|want|to|read|a|little|more|,|this|will|take|you|to|some|of|my|favorite|posts|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4620051149631627748/Our-Story	Our Story	I’m just the Mom…. As they say, life is a journey. My first love was horses. Worked on farms in NJ, MA, NY, and Hawaii. At some point, I realized that I didn’t have enough money, talent or the right personality to deal with the two-legged animals. When I found myself using my hair blower to warm my hands after mending the fence-line for the umpteenth time, I knew it was time to get out of the horse business. Mary up on Ginger’s Coley. June 1974 Ringoes, NJ. From there, I worked in hotel kitchens on Maui. I also worked part-time sales jobs on Front Street as well as at a stable. Taking tourists on trail rides to the beach, through fields of sugarcane and pineapple plantations was especially memorable. My job at the stable was to keep the horses tuned up and safe for vacationers. After five years of paradise, it broke my heart to move back to the mainland. The plan was to go to the CIA . Ironically, I had worked at a farm around the corner from the school. Funny to think I could return to where I started. Black Rock Terrace, Sheraton Maui, 1983. In the midst of putting my school application together, I had an epiphany. I was working for a caterer and realized, as much as I loved cooking, after 7 years working odd hours, weekends, holidays, I wanted a more traditional life. This was the early 80’s and there weren’t too many women chefs. I was tired of having to prove myself because I was a woman (it’s a very physical job). So, once again I changed paths. I wanted to find a career that could support my (horse) habit. Decided that Katy Gibbs , a secretarial school in Philadelphia, was where I could get a new skill set. After graduating; worked for a sales company, then a law firm before getting a job in NYC with Merrill Lynch. This was a GREAT job! I was an executive secretary for the head of Operations in their Unit Investment Trust division. The office was located at One Liberty Plaza. Commuting from NJ meant taking the PATH to the Twin Towers. They wanted to promote and train me in computer systems. It was a great opportunity, however, as plans often do, they changed. One evening after work, I was walking my dog and he found my future husband (good boy!). John, Mary & Trapper. September 1989. We moved to southern California the day after we were married. This is where our flower child was born. This is the end of the fairy tale and where real life begins. We were clueless as to what was ahead. We didn’t know that it would take 13 years before getting a true diagnosis, Angelman Syndrome , or that Jess would have to wait to till she was 21 before she would have a voice through the app SFY an AAC .

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4604757898073499813/You-Don't-Say	You Don't Say	Time for tea. October 17, 2017 by Mary1991. One morning last week, we were in a rush. The alarm didn’t go off and we overslept. Like a drill sergeant, I barked “hurry, let’s go, now!”. Within fourteen minutes flat, Jess ate and got dressed with barely a minute to spare before her ride arrived. She didn’t have enough time to tell me what she wanted for breakfast and we didn’t talk about our plans for the rest of the day. As I waved goodbye, I realized I was still wearing part of my jams. Even though mornings like this rarely happen, it makes me feel bad. In my opinion, lack of time is the number one reason for communication breakdowns. We can spend hours modeling language but if they feel pressure due to lack of time, then don’t be surprised when not much is said. Jess has learned to compensate by speaking in a holophrastic manner, using single words to express herself rather than a full phrase. Sometimes her opinion is stated in an emphatic “yes, yes, yes”, but mostly she interjects adjectives such as, “exceptional, ridiculous, rude”. This method is effective when she is with multiple people. Jess has also learned that one word can be used as an icebreaker. For example, she tapped the word “conversation”, then looked at Dad. She decided it was time they should talk, and they did. All it took was one word to get his attention and all it takes is one word to get her on a roll. At home, we encourage Jess to expand her sentences. A single word is not enough, especially if she is requesting something. The rule is, if it’s not in a sentence and if she isn’t specific, then the answer is no. Sounds harsh, but the bar needed to be raised. After imposing our demands, Jess said, “attention you, cookie, more Graham crackers.”. I love it when she uses words in a different way. Even though she lacks proper grammar in this example, she used “attention” in a way that she hadn’t before. Too often, people look too closely at what an AAC user says and forgets (or doesn’t appreciate the importance) that they need to practice playing with their voice. It doesn’t matter that she said this incorrectly because we have seen her self-correct over time. We are at the stage where we need to revisit how to have a polite conversation. Typical talkers (those that don’t use an AAC device) learn to ask, “how are you?”, “I am fine, how are you?”. We have never taught Jess to use a script, however, I think she’s ready. I don’t expect her to carry a conversation (not now, not yet) but I do expect her to be part of one. Maybe it would be helpful to have an afternoon tea? Jess would enjoy having scones and biscuits with polite conversation. She can practice proper etiquette by not holding her pinky out. Yes, this is what we will do. If this goes well, she may want to send invites? Stay tuned. Filed Under: AAC , Now we are talking , Speak for Yourself. AAC- Pay it Forward. October 5, 2017 by Mary1991. Every month has a holiday associated with it. New Year’s, we wipe the slate clean. June is for brides, graduations and the start of summer. Then there is October, which is AAC awareness month. Fooled ya. Betcha thought I was going to say Halloween! I’m not afraid of spooks but I am afraid that people don’t know what AAC is. Over the course of Jessie’s day, she sees only one other person using an AAC device (we call it her Talker). Imagine going to the market, a party or to work and no one expressed themselves or talked the way you did? Jess isn’t speaking a foreign language but she might as well be when she talks through her AAC device. This is why awareness is so vital. Half our problem is that people don’t know what AAC is much less it’s many forms. The other half is the assumptions people make. For example, yesterday Jess and I were at a planning committee meeting. She saw a plate of cookies and asked for some using her Talker. Fine. No problem. Then she smiled at the lady sitting next to her and did her version of shaking hands resulting in the “oh aren’t you special” treatment (I mean this as no disrespect because Jess does present herself this way. It’s her way of working a crowd). As the meeting went on, I don’t recall if Jess was making a comment, or was exasperated by the first speaker monologing (there were five more departments sharing reports) when she tapped “ridiculous”. This caused three people in earshot to chuckle and they gave knowing glances. At that moment, the woman next to Jess did a double take, she was re-assessing Jess. I then asked Jess to put her Talker into whisper mode so she didn’t interrupt the meeting again. I’m pretty sure she was bored and wanted to change the subject. Whenever Jess goes anywhere, she wears her Talker. Every day she is exposing people to “her” voice. However, we need to do more. For AAC awareness month, our wish is for every family that uses a device (or any of AAC’s many forms) to Pay it Forward. Tell three friends and ask them to tell three friends. Explain that when they share that they are making our world bigger. I want AAC to be as commonly known as a phone. And if you are not an AAC family, I want you to pay it forward too. Here’s a sample script:. You: I just met a person that uses AAC. Them: What’s AAC? You: It’s augmentative and alternative communication. Them: What does that mean? You: Dude you are already using it… when you text on your phone, you are talking without speaking. Some people aren’t able to speak so they use a computer to talk for them. Even emoji’s are AAC. Actually, this script wasn’t made up. A few years ago we were having breakfast at IHOP. I overheard our waiter tell a co-worker how Jess ordered using an iPad. Even though we educate people every chance we get, there is more emphasis during October. I’m hoping that when people Pay it Forward we feel a ripple effect because awareness has been shared. Remember, knowledge is good! Friend or foe, Fox or friend. September 30, 2017 by Mary1991. Often I listen to Talk Radio while running errands. The other day, the host was wondering how news reporters can watch someone in a dire situation and not rush to aid. For a photographer, if they stop, they will lose their shot. Of course, there are times you can’t help and you can only witness. I have read about many who picked up their camera afterward and continued. They saved the day but lost the moment. This topic intrigued me. Turning the question around, asking what would I do? I’d like to think that I’d jump in to help but you won’t know till you are in the moment. The husband says, there are two types of people. Those that run towards an opportunity or away from a problem. However, there’s a third option, those that don’t react and do nothing. Later in the day. Jess and I went apple picking with friends. It was a beautiful day to walk in the orchard. The trees were heavy with fruit and it was easy pickings. It didn’t take long to fill our bags with apples. As we headed back, slowly meandering out, Jess was leading the way. She was about forty-two feet ahead of us ( I’m specific because I replayed this event in my mind. I’ve also walked enough courses for fences to know my stride.). Just after the bend in the dirt road, I glanced up at Jess and my heart stopped. There was a Red Fox jumping at her feet! Jess had a small bottle of bubbles in her right hand and she was holding it high above her head as if she were playing keep away. The fox seemed interested in what she had and was dancing around her. Instantly, I started running towards Jess yelling, “go, go, go…”. All I could do was make noise so the fox would move along. I sensed that Jess would want to reach down to pet him like she does when she is greeted by a dog. The thought that should could get bitten made me run faster. Fox tend to keep their distance from people. To be approached could mean he was sick but this one looked healthy. My guess is he lives in the orchard and has become comfortable with humans, maybe had been released after rehabilitation. Regardless, I reacted and didn’t think. While I was alarmed, my friends were not. Was this because it wasn’t their child, or was it because they didn’t grow up on a farm? Their laid-back nature made me feel like a drama queen. (found out later that one didn’t see and the other caught a glimpse, so this explains). We were a short walk back to the register (where we’d weigh and pay for the apples), Jess voiced her displeasure the whole way. Because I yelled, she thought she was in trouble and protested the unfairness all the way back to our car. She had been minding her own business, hadn’t done anything wrong, was not afraid of the fox and couldn’t understand why she had been wronged. Over and over I repeated why I was scared. I explained that whenever an animal shows unusual behavior, you need to be careful. It took us both awhile to calm down. Earlier this summer, the husband saw a Black Bear walking through our backyard. I griefed him about not taking a photo. Now I get it. I understand how he felt. Even though the bear was just passing through, it was unusual to see and he went into protection mode. It’s been a few days and I can still visualize the fox standing at Jess’s feet, his eyes turning to look at me before fox-trotting off. He did not understand why he was being yelled at. I’m sure he too felt he did nothing wrong. It’s human nature to fear what we don’t understand. Not till I had shooed the fox did I say “damn, that would have been an awesome photo”. It’s ironic, after raising the “what would I do” question that I was tested. I guess the answer depends on what your element is. I may not have street smarts but have lived on farms, This is my comfort zone. I love knowing that Jess is an animal whisperer. It’s one of her gifts. Animals sense that she will not harm. Dog, cats, and horses are drawn to her, so why not foxes? It’s all beginning to make perfect sense. Filed Under: Now we are talking , Random reads. Bad choices make good stories. September 21, 2017 by Mary1991. Sometimes I can’t see the forest for the trees. When I watch Jess too closely, I often miss the big picture. I hate it when other people do this and I abhor it when I catch myself falling into this same trap. A couple of weeks ago, Jess had a day where she did not utter a word on her iPad. I gave her grief about her not making an effort. As it turns out, she wasn’t feeling well. Of course, no one wants to talk when they feel poorly. What annoys me most is that I didn’t allow her this option and I jumped to conclusions. I let fear take a front seat, allowing it to drive my emotions. That’s the thing about hindsight, it’s 20/20. Can’t tell you how many times I’ve assumed too much and needed to apologize to Jess. More often than not, I say, “Mommy was wrong”. How frustrating it must be for her to be misunderstood. How fortunate I am that she always forgives me. Thank goodness she doesn’t hold a grudge. Maybe I need to add the phrase “oh Mother” or my favorite “oh the humanity” so she can express the feeling of injustice? (I will ask her, maybe she will want to say both). Sometimes, Jess uses non-verbal ways when frustrated. Over the summer, as we were finishing breakfast, she reached over and made a grab for a plate of bacon. As she was lunging across the table for the food (Angelman parent’s, I know you know what I mean), our host caught her by the wrist. Before I could say anything, he turned to me and sternly said, “don’t say a word”. The first thing that swirled through my brain was disappointment. We didn’t make it through our visit without a scene. I never excuse bad behavior, however, I did try to make light of it and was shut down. In hindsight, no one asked Jess if she wanted seconds (this is where I failed). Unfortunately, it was painfully obvious that there was no tolerance at the table. This was a humiliating experience. I felt bullied because I know that the host would not have spoken to my husband this way. I felt bad for Jess because she acted out of frustration. After we left, I reminded Jess that she could have asked and then told her that we were all partly to blame. Regardless, this was not handled well. There is no excuse for bad manners/ bad behavior. Last night we had more non-verbal drama. Dinner was a two-course meal. We started with chili and then would have Chef salad. Jess saw the salad and objected to the chili. She smacked the table and left the room. So much for family unity. Within minutes, Jess returned and asked for salad on her Talker and all was well again. When she cleaned her plate, she asked for more salad. I’m not happy with how she expressed herself in the beginning, however, she pulled it together and we were all able to enjoy our meal. At dinner’s end, she said, “afterwards anybody want ice cream…eat remarkable ice cream…sprinkles”? We’ve been on a strict Whole30 diet for the last few weeks, so there has been no dessert. However, I was not going to refuse her after she made such a nice request. There wasn’t any ice cream in our freezer, one cone at our local drive-in costs as much as a half-gallon at the market, so we went to Shop-rite. Not only did I buy ice cream (which was on sale) but I picked up a bottle of sprinkles because Jess had been specific. When I was in line, I changed my mind, returned the sprinkles and purchased M&M’s instead. Back at home, I told Jess I didn’t get sprinkles. I bought M&M’s. Asked her if she was okay with this. The answer was an enthusiastic yes! Then I added the word “substituted” in her Talker. This is a typical day in our life. This is part of our Angelman journey. We are far from perfect, but we are trying to do the best we can. Honestly, I don’t know who is the grasshopper and who is the master. Learning never ends. especially when you learn from them. Filed Under: AAC , Now we are talking. Chasing dreams. September 9, 2017 by Mary1991. Over the summer, I had a bad case of writer’s block. I had nothing, nada, zilch. Looking for inspiration, I listened to a TED talk hoping to learn how writers found their spark. One lecture, had me mesmerized. Elizabeth Gilbert shared about poet Ruth Stone, how she “would run like hell home”, chased by a poem. She had to get to a piece of paper to write before the words thundered through her. If she didn’t write, it would be lost. [Read more…] about Chasing dreams. Filed Under: Distractible me , Random reads. Does she remember me? September 8, 2017 by Mary1991. Many times, we’ve been asked, “does she remember me?”. Why is it that when people realize Jess isn’t verbal, they assume she has a memory problem too? (They also presume she doesn’t understand but I’m not going to go into that now.). Over the weekend, Jess tapped “Grand Daddy” on her Talker. I asked, “can you find me his photo?”. Immediately, she got up, went to another room, returned with his picture. I can’t remember the last time Jess asked about my father. He passed twelve years ago, seven years before she got her AAC voice. Though I think of him often, I rarely talk about him. With so many years in between, it makes me wonder what else she thinks about? I don’t know what sparked her memory. Often when people ask about others, it’s because they want to know more. It makes me realize that I need to share family lore. I’ve been shortchanging her by keeping it to myself. Jess will be home soon. I’m going to tell her that her Grand Daddy grew up during the Great Depression. Will then have to explain to her what the Depression was. I’ll tell her when I was a pre-teen, he took me to the 1000 islands on a fishing trip. (I’d better get a map out). After spending the day on a small outboard motorboat, our guide took us to a tiny island, built a fire and cooked bacon, eggs and the fresh trout we caught. Even though these stories may interest her, she will probably want to hear about the times she spent with him. Photos will help tell the stories. And, of course, Jess needs to know that her Grand Daddy never stopped researching why she was unable to talk. His generation went to the library and Google hadn’t been invented yet. We didn’t find out Jess’s Angelman Diagnosis till two-months after he passed. While reminiscing, we will be modeling language and reinforcing motor-planning memory. Jess may not share all the details that she holds in her memory, but I assure you, when she sets her mind to something, it’s a steel trap. I’d better go, Jess and I have a lot to talk about.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4603247444824816944/You-Don't-Say	You Don't Say	Missed opportunities. March 14, 2018 by Mary1991. Jessie ordering using SFY. We have a saying in our house, don’t state the obvious. However, sometimes what is obvious is easily overlooked. As I was falling asleep last night, I replayed the day’s events and realized I had missed an opportunity. Because Jess isn’t as chatty at home as she is when we are out, the ice cream social was created. I don’t know which is more exciting for her, having ice cream or seeing Heidi, however, the combination is a magical combination. I wish I could say Jess had a bevy of friends, she doesn’t. It’s easy to assume that this is because she has Angelman Syndrome (AS) but on closer scrutiny, Jess is particular about who she wants to be with. She does gravitate towards other AS people but she has only met a few. Fortunately, Jess is content with quality, not quantity, and doesn’t need to be part of a crowd. One thing I know for sure is that Heidi is on her A-list. The staff at It’s Nutt’s know Jessie. Like all their patrons, they never rush her when she’s ordering. On this day, the restaurant was quieter than usual which makes it easier to hear Jessie’s Talker. photo courtesy Jessie Kay Exploring features of the 10. While waiting for the ice cream to be served (with all the toppings that she ordered), Jess saw Heidi’s new phone and didn’t hesitate to pick it up (only good friends allow others to touch their phone much less explore). Jess wasn’t interested in the apps but instead opened the photos. Somehow, she figured out how to create slideshows (I think they were of Heidi’s kids). After that, she started taking pictures and saw that she could change the filters (our phone doesn’t have this feature). Then she and Heidi played with Snapchat. All in all, it was a fun afternoon and we needed a winter distraction. Photo courtesy of Heidi LoStracco. One of the biggest challenges being an AAC user is not being able to talk to other people who use a Talker. In this sense, Jess is always the odd man out. This is when I realized that we missed an obvious opportunity. There is no reason why I can’t bring my Talker and Heidi is always packing. As important as modeling language is, it’s just as important for us all to converse with our Talkers because we can. Next time, we will. Just one more…I don’t like this photo of me but I do like the photos Jessie takes. Of course, these are just some of the unedited photos. At home, Jess uses her old iPad and an iPod. The larger iPhone 10 was easier for her to manipulate. Jess likes the artsy shots. Courtesy Jessie Kay.
