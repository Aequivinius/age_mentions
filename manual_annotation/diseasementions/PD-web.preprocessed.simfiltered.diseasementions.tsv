medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4723273462185245644/Virtual-reality-could-be-used-to-treat-autism	Virtual reality could be used to treat autism	"Playing games in virtual reality (VR) could be a key tool in treating people with neurological disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. The technology, according to a recent study from the University of Waterloo, could help individuals with these neurological conditions shift their perceptions of time, which their conditions lead them to perceive differently. ""The ability to estimate the passage of time with precision is fundamental to our ability to interact with the world,"" says co-author Séamas Weech, post-doctoral fellow in Kinesiology. ""For some individuals, however, the internal clock is maladjusted, causing timing deficiencies that affect perception and action. ""Studies like ours help us to understand how these deficiencies might be acquired, and how to recalibrate time perception in the brain."" The UWaterloo study involved 18 females and 13 males with normal vision and no sensory, musculoskeletal or neurological disorders. The researchers used a virtual reality game, Robo Recall, to create a natural setting in which to encourage re-calibration of time perception. The key manipulation of the study was that the researchers coupled the speed and duration of visual events to the participant's body movements. The researchers measured participants' time perception abilities before and after they were exposed to the dynamic VR task. Some participants also completed non-VR time-perception tasks, such as throwing a ball, to use as a control comparison. The researchers measured the actual and perceived durations of a moving probe in the time perception tasks. They discovered that the virtual reality manipulation was associated with significant reductions in the participants' estimates of time, by around 15 percent. ""This study adds valuable proof that the perception of time is flexible, and that VR offers a potentially valuable tool for recalibrating time in the brain,"" says Weech. ""It offers a compelling application for rehabilitation initiatives that focus on how time perception breaks down in certain populations."" Weech adds, however, that while the effects were strong during the current study, more research is needed to find out how long the effects last, and whether these signals are observable in the brain. ""For developing clinical applications, we need to know whether these effects are stable for minutes, days, or weeks afterward. A longitudinal study would provide the answer to this question."" ""Virtual reality technology has matured dramatically,"" says Michael Barnett-Cowan, neuroscience professor in the Department of Kinesiology and senior author of the paper. ""VR now convincingly changes our experience of space and time, enabling basic research in perception to inform our understanding of how the brains of normal, injured, aged and diseased populations work and how they can be treated to perform optimally."" The article, ""Movement-Contingent Time Flow in Virtual Reality Causes Temporal Recalibration"" was written by Ambika Bansal, Séamas Weech and Michael Barnett-Cowan, and published in Scientific Reports .

He told the lead EMT this as the man was listening to his heart with a stethoscope. The EMT told my father, ""I wouldn't worry about feeling embarrassed sir, I just came from a call where I had my hands in a man's chest trying to save him. If the only thing you feel bad about today is an embarrassing call to us, I would say that's a great day."" That completely put things in perspective for us. It got me thinking, what could have been done if he had had a heart attack? What are some of the treatments for people mid-myocardial infarction? The studies have shown over the years have shown that immediate attention to a heart attack is key to the best possible outcome to a heart attack. During the heart attack, the heart can stop altogether (cardiac arrest or beat out of synch arrhythmia but if EMTs are on the scene they can determine what course of treatments may be most immediately affective.

All the people in this club are different. I can tell you that the antagonist drugs do have more side effects for others that post. My cousin takes Pramipexole and he seems more hyper and tends to be compulsive. My doctor has kept me on plan old sinemet. My autonomic dysfunction was Constipation and hypostatic blood pressure with bouts of depression and through in fatigue. This I had before any diagnosis. I am no doctor. But I am sluggish in the morning as well. Does your husband sleep straight through till morning or does he get up throughout the night. I saw you did not mention clonazePam it is usually given for Rem Sleep disorder. (that makes you foggy in the morning.) I think Most drugs for anxiety calm you down. (Fatigue?)do to drug. I know Co-Careldopa(sinemet) makes one tired. I take 900mg/day. (diagnosed 5 years symptoms 10years) I definately would talk to you doctor about the confusion. I will tell you in my case if I have had times where my sleep has been little or none I have bouts of confusion. It is always wise when talking to some of us PWP (I know someone who is hardheaded and difficult for his wife to get him to go to the doctor)?LOL But it was helpful for me to have my cognition tested. Mine tested slowed but no start of dementia. Please this is not meant to scare you. (just clears up the confusion part of your post.) To end up your husband is lucky to have a wife like you who cares about him as you do. If he is a little hardheaded. I would let him read the post from a fellow hardhead. Going to the doctor and getting extra testes if needed are part of Parkinson’s. We are not a lesser man to admit things are changing. Going to the doctor many times restores some of the changes medicine might be causing. Everyone functions better family wise checking things out.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4720168612999889503/Our-Parkinson's-Place:-Dont-Give-Up-on-This-Bittersweet-Journey	Our Parkinson's Place: Don’t Give Up on This Bittersweet Journey	"MARCH 20, 2019 BY ""SHERRI WOODBRIDGE"" Everything’s not all right or OK. Like it or not, we have a chronic disease that won’t go away. Our days are consumed with uncontrollable thoughts; they ravage our minds, threaten our souls, and grasp for our spirits. Will we ever be “us” again — those beings who once dwelled inside these bodies? Will we become the burden we think others perceive us to be or that we believe ourselves to be? Will we pout and feel sorry for ourselves, thinking our lives are nearly done when not long ago, it seemed that they were just beginning? We need to find a way to view our circumstances with new eyes. To realize that our situation may actually be a blessing instead of a curse. We can choose to travel this bittersweet journey that’s been laid at our feet. Remaining positive despite this disease can be extremely challenging. We must remind ourselves that things could be worse and be thankful for what we have. We can consider what we can still accomplish. Adopting a fresh perspective helps us to get through each day instead of wallowing in “what could have been.”. Once in a while, someone will say something to us that should have been left unsaid; words they deemed wise yet when spoken aloud came across as ignorant, inappropriate, or distasteful. Incorrect and inadequate information about Parkinson’s disease leads to foolish comments. We can feel defensive and sad at the remarks we hear. Or we can put on our masked smiles and let them think they know better when in reality, we know best. These are the facts of having Parkinson’s: We shuffle when we walk, we choke when we eat, we drool on our pillows. We shake on the outside and the inside. Sometimes it feels as if we are going to come right out of our skins. Our toes curl and cramp, our fingers as well, and sometimes we wonder if we will ever feel normal again. “Normal” becomes a distant world. We experience stiffness on the left side and rigidity on the right, along with intense pain. We grieve for things gained and lost. Depression vies for our attention; even as we try to push it back into its place, it seeks to control by beckoning, mocking, and screaming out our names. Our speech may be soft or so slurred that others strain to hear our words. We are interrupted, cut off, and misunderstood. We feel as if we have nothing worthwhile to contribute to conversations, which in turn leaves us feeling insignificant. However, despite our “abnormalities,” and mixed-up and out-of-control feelings, we cannot, and will not, quit. Quit is a four-letter word, as foul as those others are when used in conjunction with the unrelenting challenge of finding a cure. If we quit, we give up. We relinquish control to this disease. And that is something we must — as long as it is within our power — never, ever do. Note: Parkinson’s News Today is strictly a news and information website about the disease.

I know saying that might scare you, but the truth is Type 2 diabetes is a growing epidemic in America that goes hand in hand with obesity. If you are not diabetic or your have pre-diabetes it is not too late to turn things around! The truth is, diabetes if left unchecked can cause major health problems years from now. The symptoms are often silent, but if you are overweight or obese chances are you are insulin resistant. Diabetes is partly due in part to genetics and lifestyle. You can greatly reduce your chances of developing the disease by lowering your weight and following a slow carb diet, such as The Day Off Diet. You need to dramatically decrease your dependency on sugar and refined flours. Foods that are high on the GI index like starch, sugar and flour. Doing this alone with help you dramatically reduce your body weight. You don't have to give up your favorite foods forever, you just have to cut back on them dramatically and learn to make your favorite foods in new ways. 	1	0	Diabetes|Research|-|Learn|How|to|Treat|Diabetes|Now|!|-|Parkinson-Web-Forum	Diabetes|Research|-|Learn|How|to|Treat|Diabetes|Now|!|I|know|saying|that|might|scare|you|,|but|the|truth|is|Type|2|diabetes|is|a|growing|epidemic|in|America|that|goes|hand|in|hand|with|obesity|.|If|you|are|not|diabetic|or|your|have|pre-diabetes|it|is|not|too|late|to|turn|things|around|!|The|truth|is|,|diabetes|if|left|unchecked|can|cause|major|health|problems|years|from|now|.|The|symptoms|are|often|silent|,|but|if|you|are|overweight|or|obese|chances|are|you|are|insulin|resistant|.|Diabetes|is|partly|due|in|part|to|genetics|and|lifestyle|.|You|can|greatly|reduce|your|chances|of|developing|the|disease|by|lowering|your|weight|and|following|a|slow|carb|diet|,|such|as|The|Day|Off|Diet|.|You|need|to|dramatically|decrease|your|dependency|on|sugar|and|refined|flours|.|Foods|that|are|high|on|the|GI|index|like|starch|,|sugar|and|flour|.|Doing|this|alone|with|help|you|dramatically|reduce|your|body|weight|.|You|don't|have|to|give|up|your|favorite|foods|forever|,|you|just|have|to|cut|back|on|them|dramatically|and|learn|to|make|your|favorite|foods|in|new|ways|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4719095424271251530/Investigating-the-Role-of-LRRK2-in-Mycobacterial-Infection	Investigating the Role of LRRK2 in Mycobacterial Infection	HOME › ABOUT THE FOUNDATION › FUNDED GRANTS ›. LRRK2 Challenge, 2013. Mutations in the LRRK2 gene are the most common known genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease. Although we know that these mutations can cause Parkinson's disease, the physiological function of the LRRK2 protein (genes encode proteins) remains a mystery. However, a hint of the LRRK2 function emerged from genetic studies in people with leprosy, a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae. They found that LRRK2 is associated to susceptibility to infection with M. leprae. The aim of this project is to find out if LRRK2 participates in the immune response to mycobacteria. Project Description:. We will use a wide range of cellular and pre-clinical models of mycobacterial infection combined with methods of LRRK2 manipulation such as pharmacological inhibition and gene knockdown/knockout. First, we will evaluate the impact of pharmacological manipulation of LRRK2 s activity and LRRK2 loss of function on the infective process of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in cellular models. Second, we will investigate whether the loss of LRRK2 in knockout models alters the susceptibility to infection by M. tuberculosis . Relevance to Diagnosis/Treatment of Parkinson s Disease:. Understanding the physiological roles of LRRK2 has the potential to shape our view of its role in Parkinson s disease as well as our approach to targeting LRRK2 as a means to developing a therapy.

AbbVie has launched a Phase 1 trial in the United States to assess the safety and tolerability of an investigational antibody targeting alpha-synuclein called ABBV-0805 in healthy volunteers. This study comes after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an investigational new drug application for ABBV-0805 in February. Findings of this initial Phase 1 trial will provide critical information for the design and progression of future clinical studies on this antibody as a potential disease-modifying treatment for patients with Parkinson’s disease . Formerly known as BAN0805, ABBV-0805 was initially engineered and developed by BioArctic . It is a monoclonal antibody designed to specifically bind and destroy toxic aggregates of alpha-synuclein protein, which are known to contribute to the development of Parkinson’s disease. In preclinical studies , this investigational antibody effectively decreased the levels of alpha-synuclein clumps by 65% compared with placebo. In addition, treatment with ABBV-0805 also delayed disease progression, reduced Parkinson’s-associated motor symptoms , and improved overall survival in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease. BioArctic and AbbVie established a strategic collaboration agreement in 2016 for the further development and future marketing rights on BioArctic’s portfolio of antibodies directed against alpha-synuclein. More recently, in December 2018, AbbVie exercised its option to acquire full rights over ABBV-0805. The company is now responsible for the clinical program and regulatory approval of the new antibody as a treatment for Parkinson’s and other potential indications. “It is gratifying that our partner AbbVie has started the first clinical trial, a Phase 1 study, with ABBV-0805,” Gunilla Osswald, PhD, CEO of BioArctic, said in a press release . “We are now looking forward to ABBV-0805 moving forward in the clinical program and developing into a therapy with the potential to provide meaningful advances for patients with Parkinson’s disease.”. BioArctic will continue to develop other potential therapies targeting misfolded and abnormal proteins linked to Parkinson’s disease in the continued collaboration with AbbVie. “I am looking forward to continuing the successful partnership with the ambition to deliver a new innovative disease modifying treatment to improve the quality of life for the large number of patients with Parkinson’s disease,” Osswald said in a previous press release . 	1	0	Our|Parkinson's|Place|:|Potential|Parkinson|’|s|Therapy|ABBV|-|0805|Enters|Phase|1|Testing|in|Healthy|Volunteers	MARCH|15|,|2019|BY|ALICE|MELÃO|.|AbbVie|has|launched|a|Phase|1|trial|in|the|United|States|to|assess|the|safety|and|tolerability|of|an|investigational|antibody|targeting|alpha-synuclein|called|ABBV|-|0805|in|healthy|volunteers|.|This|study|comes|after|the|U|.|S|.|Food|and|Drug|Administration|approved|an|investigational|new|drug|application|for|ABBV|-|0805|in|February|.|Findings|of|this|initial|Phase|1|trial|will|provide|critical|information|for|the|design|and|progression|of|future|clinical|studies|on|this|antibody|as|a|potential|disease-modifying|treatment|for|patients|with|Parkinson|’|s|disease|.|Formerly|known|as|BAN|0805|,|ABBV|-|0805|was|initially|engineered|and|developed|by|BioArctic|.|It|is|a|monoclonal|antibody|designed|to|specifically|bind|and|destroy|toxic|aggregates|of|alpha-synuclein|protein|,|which|are|known|to|contribute|to|the|development|of|Parkinson|’|s|disease|.|In|preclinical|studies|,|this|investigational|antibody|effectively|decreased|the|levels|of|alpha-synuclein|clumps|by|65|%|compared|with|placebo|.|In|addition|,|treatment|with|ABBV|-|0805|also|delayed|disease|progression|,|reduced|Parkinson|’|s-associated|motor|symptoms|,|and|improved|overall|survival|in|a|mouse|model|of|Parkinson|’|s|disease|.|BioArctic|and|AbbVie|established|a|strategic|collaboration|agreement|in|2016|for|the|further|development|and|future|marketing|rights|on|BioArctic|’|s|portfolio|of|antibodies|directed|against|alpha-synuclein|.|More|recently|,|in|December|2018|,|AbbVie|exercised|its|option|to|acquire|full|rights|over|ABBV|-|0805|.|The|company|is|now|responsible|for|the|clinical|program|and|regulatory|approval|of|the|new|antibody|as|a|treatment|for|Parkinson|’|s|and|other|potential|indications|.|“|It|is|gratifying|that|our|partner|AbbVie|has|started|the|first|clinical|trial|,|a|Phase|1|study|,|with|ABBV|-|0805|,|”|Gunilla|Osswald|,|PhD|,|CEO|of|BioArctic|,|said|in|a|press|release|.|“|We|are|now|looking|forward|to|ABBV|-|0805|moving|forward|in|the|clinical|program|and|developing|into|a|therapy|with|the|potential|to|provide|meaningful|advances|for|patients|with|Parkinson|’|s|disease|.|”|.|BioArctic|will|continue|to|develop|other|potential|therapies|targeting|misfolded|and|abnormal|proteins|linked|to|Parkinson|’|s|disease|in|the|continued|collaboration|with|AbbVie|.|“|I|am|looking|forward|to|continuing|the|successful|partnership|with|the|ambition|to|deliver|a|new|innovative|disease|modifying|treatment|to|improve|the|quality|of|life|for|the|large|number|of|patients|with|Parkinson|’|s|disease|,|”|Osswald|said|in|a|previous|press|release|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4717663863964274894/Research-details-how-manganese-exposure-cancontribute-to-onset-of-Parkinson's-like-symptoms	Research details how manganese exposure can contribute to onset of Parkinson's-like symptoms	"Reviewed by Alina Shrourou, BSc Mar 13 2019. A new study from Iowa State University biomedical researchers illuminates the biological processes by which exposure to some metals can contribute to the onset of Parkinson's-like symptoms. The study, published today in the peer-reviewed journal Science Signaling , focuses on the metal manganese, which has a range of industrial uses as an alloy. Anumantha Kanthasamy, a Clarence Hartley Covault Distinguished Professor in veterinary medicine and the Eugene and Linda Lloyd Endowed Chair of Neurotoxicology, said the research details how manganese exposure can lead to misfolded proteins in the brain, which cause a neurological disease. Kanthasamy said the findings could lead to earlier detection of the disease and better outcomes for patients. Kanthasamy said small amounts of manganese are necessary for the proper functioning of the human body, but too much exposure has been linked with neurological symptoms much like those experienced by patients with Parkinson's Disease. Links between manganese and neurological disorders have been noted since the 1950s, Kanthasamy said, because of the tendency of manganese to accumulate in brain tissues. The latest study found that manganese combines with a protein in the brain called alpha- synuclein. Previous studies showed the protein was susceptible to misfolding, but Kanthasamy and his colleagues set out to discover how it interacted with manganese and how that interaction facilitates the progression of disease. The researchers found the pathological form of misfolded alpha-synuclein proteins get packaged into vesicles, which allow the misfolded proteins to transfer from cell to cell to propagate the protein-seeding activity. These vesicles provoke inflammation of tissues and can lead to a neurodegenerative response, the study found. The study drew on data gathered from mice as well as blood serum samples from welders provided by clinicians at Penn State University. The study found welders exposed to manganese had increased misfolded alpha-synuclein serum content, meaning the welders are at a higher risk for developing Parkinson's symptoms, Kanthasamy said. The research could contribute to a new assay, or medical test, to detect the presence of misfolded alpha-synuclein proteins. This could lead to earlier detection of Parkinson's Disease and a way to gauge the effectiveness of drugs designed to slow the disease. ""As the disease advances, it's harder to slow it down with treatments,"" Kanthasamy said. ""Earlier detection, perhaps by testing for misfolded alpha-synuclein, can lead to better outcomes for patients. Such a test might also indicate whether someone is at risk before the onset of the disease."" Kanthasamy cautioned the research is still at an experimental stage, meaning it could be years before such an assay could be available.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4717663863965180231/Study:-Low-risk-hip-replacement-patients-can-skip-standard-hip-precautions	Study: Low-risk hip replacement patients can skip standard hip precautions	"Reviewed by Alina Shrourou, BSc Mar 13 2019. Low-risk patients undergoing a total hip replacement with a posterior approach can skip the standard hip precautions currently recommended for post-surgical recovery, according to a new study conducted at Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), in New York City. Eliminating standard precautions in this population did not increase the risk of hip dislocation, according to the research presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, March 12-16 (abstract #140). ""The majority of patients we see are low risk; 90% of patients probably qualify for minimized precautions,"" said Peter Sculco, MD, the study's lead author and an orthopedic surgeon specializing in hip and knee replacement at HSS. In the last ten years, surgeons have started favoring the anterior approach (through the back of the hip) for total hip replacement over the posterior approach, because it doesn't involve standard hip precautions. Little data, however, backs the standard hip precautions recommended for the posterior approach. For a posterior approach, standard precautions are not flexing your hip past 90 degrees, not internally rotating your hip more than 10 degrees, using an elevated seat cushion at all times and a grabber for anything that is on the ground, and sleeping on your back for six weeks. ""The precautions can be limiting and cause fear in patients,"" said Dr. Sculco. ""Sleeping on your back is very uncomfortable for many people. You often hear from physical therapists that patients are relieved when they can finally cross their legs and sleep on their side."" The literature showing that hip precautions make a difference in hip dislocation is poor. ""The current precautions are based on hip replacements done 25 years ago, and we have changed a lot in terms of improving how we do hip replacements that has given us more confidence in the stability of our hips,"" said Dr. Sculco. ""Our understanding of the dynamic movement of the pelvis and how we put the parts in is much different. The quality of our soft tissue repair and closure at the end of surgery is much more robust."" When patients are on stringent precautions, they are not as active, which can hamper recovery. ""If you minimize the hip precautions in an appropriate way, patients focus more on their mobility and recovery and less on the fear of how they turn their leg ten degrees,"" said Dr. Sculco. In the new study, researchers retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing a posterior primary uncemented total hip replacement (total hip arthroplasty) from January 2014 to June 2016 at HSS. Surgeons had the choice to put patients on standard precautions or a pose avoidance protocol, to avoid a single pose, a flexed external rotation position that occurs when a person puts on their shoe or shaves their leg. A total of 1,311 patients met the inclusion criteria for the pose avoidance cohort, and the minimum followup was six weeks. Researchers then matched patients 1:1 in this group to a historical cohort of patients based on age, gender, and body mass index that were treated with standard posterior hip precautions. Within the first six postoperative weeks, six dislocations occurred in the pose avoidance group (0.46%) compared with seven in the matched group (0.53%), a difference that was not statistically or clinically significant. ""Our results suggest that the standard postoperative precautions in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty through the posterior approach without known risk factors for instability are unnecessary,"" said Dr. Sculco. ""We may find that precautions don't make sense for any of our patients, but we need to look at in a stepwise fashion."" Risk factors include neuromuscular issues, such as stroke, Parkinson's disease and lumbar spine fusions. The study was limited in that it is not a randomized controlled trial, usually the gold standard for dictating a change in practice. ""The bottom line of the study is in recent years, we have learned more about interventions that matter after joint replacement and those that don't really have efficacy. In most patients, we got rid of powerful anticoagulants, for example, and we are moving toward a shorter stay and even outpatient arthroplasty for total hip replacement,"" said Dr. Sculco. ""Minimizing precautions and simplifying the postoperative recovery is part of the larger simplification of surgery where we are using more selected resources and interventions for people, instead of blanketing everyone with the same kind of protocols."" Dr. Sculco noted that there is an increasing demand for hip replacement in the United States. ""In 2010, there were 310,000 hip replacements in the United States and that number is increasing. Its probably 350,000 if not more now,"" said Dr. Sculco.

Images show illustrative examples of visual R2? modifications within substantia nigra (SN) at baseline (24-72 h) and follow-up (1 y) in striatum (participants 1 and 2) and control groups (participants 3 and 4). Credit: Radiological Society of North America. A simple MRI method that measures iron content can provide a more comprehensive picture of the consequences of stroke-related damage to the brain, according to a study published in the journal Radiology . Researchers said the findings point to a role for MRI brain iron measurements in monitoring recovery from stroke. Strokes can result in significant impairments caused by infarctions, or the death of tissue due to the brain 's blood supply being blocked by a clot. Long-term outcomes may also be affected by delayed degeneration of brain areas away from the location of the stroke. One such area is the substantia nigra (SN), a structure of the midbrain that is connected with other parts of the brain in several complex networks . ""Overall, the SN is strongly involved in motor control , but also in regulation of emotions, cognition and motivation,"" said study co-author Thomas Tourdias, M.D., Ph.D., professor of radiology at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire in Bordeaux, France. ""Usually, stroke doesn't directly affect the SN but, by interrupting circuits, stroke can induce secondary degeneration of that area."" Prior to the new study, this secondary degeneration of SN had only been seen on post-mortem brain examinations. Imaging on a living person has not been able to capture the long-term degeneration, so for the new study, Dr. Tourdias and colleagues employed an MRI technique that measures iron content in the brain. Iron is important for normal brain function, but an excess of it has been linked to neurodegeneration. Iron is released from dying neurons and iron -rich immune cells present around injured neurons. The excess iron further accelerates neurodegeneration through a process called oxidative stress . Average R2* maps (axial plane) in striatum (n = 75) and control (n = 106) groups at baseline (24-72 h) and follow-up (1 y). All infarcts were flipped on left side. Color-coded R2? values for striatum group and control group are shown at baseline and follow-up. Lower rows show voxel-based comparison of R2? values between striatum and control groups at baseline and follow-up. The researchers used an MRI technique called R2* mapping to evaluate 181 patients who had suffered a stroke. One year after a baseline evaluation, some of the patients showed higher iron content in the SN. This high iron content was associated with worse long-term outcomes, particularly when it was found on the same side of the brain that the stroke occurred. ""We showed that imaging of iron can also be used to image degeneration remotely from stroke in disconnected areas,"" Dr. Tourdias said. ""This finding could be clinically useful because it shows that a simple magnetic resonance imaging method such as R2* can provide a more comprehensive picture of the consequences of an infarct."" The results suggest that R2* mapping may be added to the follow-up MRI after stroke to monitor neurodegeneration, Dr. Tourdias said, by assessing iron levels in the SN. More generally, the findings lend support to the use of iron imaging as a marker for neurodegeneration, an idea that is already being explored for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. Therapies that prevent iron deposition could potentially be used to slow or stop the degeneration of the neurons. Images show voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) quantified impact of baseline infarct location on SN-AI95 of R2? at 1-year follow-up. Z score resulting from Brunner-Menzel testing is indicated by color range and is overlaid on three-dimensional T1-weighted image normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute 152 space atlas in axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. Association between infarct voxels and higher SN-AI95 is shown by lower Z score. ""We are currently investigating this direction,"" Dr. Tourdias said. ""Our imaging approach could become crucial in the clinic if modulation of iron develops as a neuroprotective strategy in the future.""

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4717726929068447992/New-insights-emerge-in-an-effort-to-repurpose-Novartis-cancer-drug-Tasigna-in-Parkinsons-disease	New insights emerge in an effort to repurpose Novartis’ cancer drug Tasigna in Parkinson’s disease	A research team at Georgetown University Medical Center previously repurposed Novartis’ blood cancer drug Tasigna for Parkinson’s disease, and turned up promising results in a preclinical mouse study and in a small group of patients. Now, they have returned with further insight into how the drug works in people with Parkinson’s. A pharmacology analysis of 75 Parkinson’s patients who are currently participating in a phase 2 study showed that Tasigna can reduce levels of toxic alpha-synuclein protein clumps that are the hallmark of the disease. That increases the levels of dopamine in the patients’ brains. The Georgetown team reported their findings in the journal Pharmacology Research & Perspectives . Tasigna (nilotinib) is approved by the FDA as a treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia. It is meant to be given twice daily at a recommended dose of as much as 400 mg for adults. In the Parkinson's study, the Georgetown researchers found that the drug could improve Parkinson’s biomarkers at a lower dose. BioBasics: Biotech For The Non-Scientist. BioBasics: Biotech for the Non-Scientist is a two-day course for those who want to better understand the science driving the industry. The course starts with basic scientific concepts and quickly delves into the causes of genetic and infectious disease and the therapeutic strategies used to mitigate disease. The latest innovations in immunotherapies, gene therapy, checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T and more are explained. The team, led by Charbel Moussa, first demonstrated Tasigna’s anti-neurodegeneration potential in 2013, testing the drug in mice that over-express alpha-synuclein. When the protein folds in the wrong way, it can block the brain from releasing neurotransmitters such as dopamine from small storage vesicles. That loss of dopamine can lead to motor symptoms like the impaired coordination that's commonly seen in Parkinson’s. After the mouse trial showed that Tasigna could help clear the harmful accumulation of alpha-synuclein and improve movement, Moussa and colleagues moved to a small trial of 12 people with either advanced Parkinson’s or dementia with Lewy bodies. The observed improvements in motor functioning and cognitive outcomes, according to a 2016 report in the Journal of Parkinson’s Disease . But in an editorial that ran alongside it, critics cautioned that the small sample size and lack of a control group made it impossible to rule out a placebo effect. RELATED: Novartis cancer drug to be tested for Parkinson’s disease. In collaboration with the Michael J. Fox Foundation and others, the Georgetown researchers started the larger phase 2 trial. While the primary goal was to determine the safety of Tasigna, the researchers also searched patients’ cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for traces of Parkinson’s biomarkers. They measured levels of 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the CSF. Because these molecules are produced when dopamine is metabolized, they could indicate how much dopamine was being used in the brain. The patients were divided into five groups that received Tasigna at 150 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg or 400 mg or a placebo. After a single dose of Tasigna, the researchers found higher levels of DOPAC and HVA than were seen in the control group. “When the drug is used, levels of these breakdown molecules quickly rise,” Moussa said in a statement. “This is exciting because this kind of potential treatment for Parkinson’s could increase use of a patient's own dopamine instead of using or periodically increasing drugs that mimic dopamine.”. Furthermore, Tasigna at 200 mg—which the team found to be the optimal dose for elevating DOPAC and HVA—also significantly increased the level of TREM-2 in the central nervous system. Because of TREM2’s anti-inflammatory role in the brain, some have suggested it could target misfolded alpha-synuclein and other harmful plaques in neurodegenerative disorders. Other scientists are also investigating potential new uses of approved drugs in neurodegeneration. A team at University College London, for example, previously showed that GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide, which is the active ingredient in AstraZeneca’s Byetta and Bydureon for Type 2 diabetes, also improved motor functions in some Parkinson’s patients. Fernando Pagan, principal investigator of the Tasigna phase 2 trial and first author of the paper said the findings suggest the Novartis drug can reduce protect dopamine-secreting neurons. But how that can be translated into clinical outcomes remains to be seen. The trial is expected to be completed in mid-2020, according to a listing on ClinicalTrials. 	1	0	New|insights|emerge|in|an|effort|to|repurpose|Novartis|’|cancer|drug|Tasigna|in|Parkinson|’|s|disease	A|research|team|at|Georgetown|University|Medical|Center|previously|repurposed|Novartis|’|blood|cancer|drug|Tasigna|for|Parkinson|’|s|disease|,|and|turned|up|promising|results|in|a|preclinical|mouse|study|and|in|a|small|group|of|patients|.|Now|,|they|have|returned|with|further|insight|into|how|the|drug|works|in|people|with|Parkinson|’|s|.|A|pharmacology|analysis|of|75|Parkinson|’|s|patients|who|are|currently|participating|in|a|phase|2|study|showed|that|Tasigna|can|reduce|levels|of|toxic|alpha-synuclein|protein|clumps|that|are|the|hallmark|of|the|disease|.|That|increases|the|levels|of|dopamine|in|the|patients|’|brains|.|The|Georgetown|team|reported|their|findings|in|the|journal|Pharmacology|Research|&|Perspectives|.|Tasigna|(|nilotinib|)|is|approved|by|the|FDA|as|a|treatment|for|chronic|myeloid|leukemia|.|It|is|meant|to|be|given|twice|daily|at|a|recommended|dose|of|as|much|as|400|mg|for|adults|.|In|the|Parkinson's|study|,|the|Georgetown|researchers|found|that|the|drug|could|improve|Parkinson|’|s|biomarkers|at|a|lower|dose|.|BioBasics|:|Biotech|For|The|Non-Scientist|.|BioBasics|:|Biotech|for|the|Non-Scientist|is|a|two-day|course|for|those|who|want|to|better|understand|the|science|driving|the|industry|.|The|course|starts|with|basic|scientific|concepts|and|quickly|delves|into|the|causes|of|genetic|and|infectious|disease|and|the|therapeutic|strategies|used|to|mitigate|disease|.|The|latest|innovations|in|immunotherapies|,|gene|therapy|,|checkpoint|inhibitors|,|CAR-T|and|more|are|explained|.|The|team|,|led|by|Charbel|Moussa|,|first|demonstrated|Tasigna|’|s|anti-neurodegeneration|potential|in|2013|,|testing|the|drug|in|mice|that|over-express|alpha-synuclein|.|When|the|protein|folds|in|the|wrong|way|,|it|can|block|the|brain|from|releasing|neurotransmitters|such|as|dopamine|from|small|storage|vesicles|.|That|loss|of|dopamine|can|lead|to|motor|symptoms|like|the|impaired|coordination|that's|commonly|seen|in|Parkinson|’|s|.|After|the|mouse|trial|showed|that|Tasigna|could|help|clear|the|harmful|accumulation|of|alpha-synuclein|and|improve|movement|,|Moussa|and|colleagues|moved|to|a|small|trial|of|12|people|with|either|advanced|Parkinson|’|s|or|dementia|with|Lewy|bodies|.|The|observed|improvements|in|motor|functioning|and|cognitive|outcomes|,|according|to|a|2016|report|in|the|Journal|of|Parkinson|’|s|Disease|.|But|in|an|editorial|that|ran|alongside|it|,|critics|cautioned|that|the|small|sample|size|and|lack|of|a|control|group|made|it|impossible|to|rule|out|a|placebo|effect|.|RELATED|:|Novartis|cancer|drug|to|be|tested|for|Parkinson|’|s|disease|.|In|collaboration|with|the|Michael|J|.|Fox|Foundation|and|others|,|the|Georgetown|researchers|started|the|larger|phase|2|trial|.|While|the|primary|goal|was|to|determine|the|safety|of|Tasigna|,|the|researchers|also|searched|patients|’|cerebral|spinal|fluid|(|CSF|)|for|traces|of|Parkinson|’|s|biomarkers|.|They|measured|levels|of|3,4-|Dihydroxyphenylacetic|acid|(|DOPAC|)|and|homovanillic|acid|(|HVA|)|in|the|CSF|.|Because|these|molecules|are|produced|when|dopamine|is|metabolized|,|they|could|indicate|how|much|dopamine|was|being|used|in|the|brain|.|The|patients|were|divided|into|five|groups|that|received|Tasigna|at|150|mg|,|200|mg|,|300|mg|or|400|mg|or|a|placebo|.|After|a|single|dose|of|Tasigna|,|the|researchers|found|higher|levels|of|DOPAC|and|HVA|than|were|seen|in|the|control|group|.|“|When|the|drug|is|used|,|levels|of|these|breakdown|molecules|quickly|rise|,|”|Moussa|said|in|a|statement|.|“|This|is|exciting|because|this|kind|of|potential|treatment|for|Parkinson|’|s|could|increase|use|of|a|patient's|own|dopamine|instead|of|using|or|periodically|increasing|drugs|that|mimic|dopamine|.|”|.|Furthermore|,|Tasigna|at|200|mg|—|which|the|team|found|to|be|the|optimal|dose|for|elevating|DOPAC|and|HVA|—|also|significantly|increased|the|level|of|TREM|-|2|in|the|central|nervous|system|.|Because|of|TREM|2|’|s|anti-inflammatory|role|in|the|brain|,|some|have|suggested|it|could|target|misfolded|alpha-synuclein|and|other|harmful|plaques|in|neurodegenerative|disorders|.|Other|scientists|are|also|investigating|potential|new|uses|of|approved|drugs|in|neurodegeneration|.|A|team|at|University|College|London|,|for|example|,|previously|showed|that|GLP|-|1|receptor|agonist|exenatide|,|which|is|the|active|ingredient|in|AstraZeneca|’|s|Byetta|and|Bydureon|for|Type|2|diabetes|,|also|improved|motor|functions|in|some|Parkinson|’|s|patients|.|Fernando|Pagan|,|principal|investigator|of|the|Tasigna|phase|2|trial|and|first|author|of|the|paper|said|the|findings|suggest|the|Novartis|drug|can|reduce|protect|dopamine-secreting|neurons|.|But|how|that|can|be|translated|into|clinical|outcomes|remains|to|be|seen|.|The|trial|is|expected|to|be|completed|in|mid|-|2020|,|according|to|a|listing|on|ClinicalTrials|.

It can cause you to redefine your relationship with your own parents, it can imbue a sobering sense of responsibility and it may even cause you to examine your own mortality. Now we know that it can also make you fat. That is the finding from a 20 year study of over 10,000 men published in the American Journal of Men's Health. As well as a bouncing bundle of joy, fatherhood also delivers an average 4.4 extra pounds for a six-foot daddy. A father who does not live with his kids can expect to gain 3.3 pounds whereas men who do not become fathers actually lose weight, around 1.4 pounds on average. Other factors that can influence weight gain such as age, race, education, income, screen time and daily activity were taken into consideration, so the weight gained was purely down to fatherhood. This extra weight gain also has the knock-on effect of raising a dad's risk of developing heart disease, diabetes and cancer. This is probably not surprising news to dads. Sleepless nights, extra treat foods and a mountain of leftovers from picky eater kids is not exactly a recipe for weight loss. Time becomes a luxury for parents and there is less of it to spare to take care of yourself. Dr. Craig Garfield is the lead author of the study and an associate professor of pediatrics and of medical social sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and attending pediatrician at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. Dr. Garfield attributes the weight gain to differences in lifestyle and eating habits between the three groups. ""You have new responsibilities when you have your kids and may not have time to take care of yourself the way you once did in terms of exercise. Your family becomes the priority,"" he stated. Luckily the Dad Bod is trending right now so dads need not lament the fact that their kids ruined their figure. However for the sake of our kids dads need to concentrate a bit more on their own health. Two women. Two stories. One problem Some years ago, I knew two very nice women, both approaching retirement age, and both with seemingly different problems. The first woman suffered from continuous pain. When I first met her, I felt sorry for her immediately. The pain was persistent and debilitating. What was most remarkable about the pain was that the source shifted. For days, she would suffer from a bad lower back. Then the pain in her back dissipated, but moved to her foot. Occasionally, she suffered from migraines. The knees, the shoulders, the neck, and other areas took turns as the source of the persistent pain. She received cortisone shots, prednisone, oxycodone, and other medications to ease her pain. Sometimes they worked briefly, only to have the pain reroute to another part of the body almost immediately. Other times, the medicine did little. After a while, I began to wonder about her condition. I believed that she experienced pain, however, I did not understand how debilitating back pain one day, could completely disappear the next, as the pain relocated. One day she could not walk; the next day she walked normal. I once asked her about this, in the most compassionate way possible. She explained that it was God having pity on her. He felt she could not handle too much pain all at once, so that when a new pain appeared, He removed the old pain so she could still function. The second woman also suffered from illnesses. She had poor general health and also experienced pain. However, more than anything else, she believed that she was a victim of society. Over the years, she related to me many stories about her life. She seemed not only to be a victim, but an incredibly unlucky person. As with the first woman, I felt sympathy for her. However, over time the stories became problematic. She began to repeat some of the accounts, only the facts appeared to change. Sometimes she altered pertinent points, while other times the chain of events grew preposterous and unbelievable. Without mentioning it to her, I began to question how true they were. Then she told me about something that happened a few months earlier. As she told the story to me, I realized that she was discussing an event of which I was familiar. Her account of that day was completely different from what actually happened. She turned a seemingly forgettable event into yet another occasion where she was an innocent victim of other people's cruelty.

One of the founding members of the University Ultra Omega Burn Review of Pittsburgh's ""Crossfit"" club, Zach Miller, took it upon himself to stay late and help train new members on correct lifting techniques. He also lobbied the college to use an unused storage space to transform it into an area they could use for their activities because of ever shrinking space at the university gym. On August 4th however Zach Miller was in a terrible car accident which caused him to be ejected from the car and subsequently be put into a coma. As bleak and sad as this sounds it could have been far worse.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4708662915579130677/Welcome-to-the-club	Welcome to the club	"I was you a year ago. I'm 49, and was diagnosed in early-mid 2018 via DAT scan. I'd had slight one-sided hand and foot tremors for four years; my initial neurologist was on the ball and told me from the outset that my tremor was concerning (because of its one-sided onset), and that it could develop into Parkinson's or could be nothing more than a tremor. He ordered the DAT scan at my request, after feeling some rigidity in one arm on one of my follow-up visits. I now see an MDS, who didn't feel any rigidity at all, but who confirmed the diagnosis of PD last May. The good news is that for many people our age progression is slow (although if you've read this forum or other resources you know PD is a boutique disease, so no promises). I'm at least 4-5 years from my initial onset of symptoms, and still have nothing more than a slight tremor. I'm on no medication. Before my diagnosis was confirmed I read an interview with a guy who was around 70 and had lived with PD for many years--he said were he to find out for the first time today that he had PD he would head to the gym before the doctor. And the gym was the first place I went--I have seen a personal trainer three times a week, every week, since the day of my diagnosis, and do additional HIIT workouts on my own. I heartily recommend truly vigorous exercise, not just because it's our only possibly effective method of slowing progression, but because it helps reduce the associated stress of knowing you have PD. I think I'm mostly at a place of acceptance, but it did not come easy (for some time after my diagnosis, there was the constant drumbeat in my head of ""You have Parkinson's,"" which now thankfully has abated somewhat). I have not shared my diagnosis with anyone other than my wife and kids. I did not tell my co-workers and have not told any of my friends. I will when the time is right, but for now I am functioning as before and don't want to introduce PD into those situations. My kids are teens, and my wife and I sat them down and gave them a frank talk about the diagnosis and what it someday might mean (and might not mean, given ongoing research). The great thing about kids is that they are resilient, and once they saw that I was going to continue living my life as before, , and they got back into their own lives, things quickly returned to normal. You will get there in time. Those who have been at this a lot longer than I have tell me that attitude is critical in dealing with PD. I try to remind myself of that every day. I have a little plaque in my closet that only I can see that reads ""do not go gentle into that good night,"" and a game of thrones inspired key chain that says, ""what do we say to the god of death? not today."" They remind me to get off my butt, stop feeling sorry for myself (not always easy), and live.

We want to hear your feedback and suggestions. What is involved in Fox Insight participation? Fox Insight is a completely online study that allows you take part anywhere at any time. Every 90 days you'll be asked to go online and complete a series of health-related questionnaires. Each time you complete your questionnaires you’ll be completing a study visit. The first study visit is the longest and takes about 45 minutes to an hour to complete. You can complete it in a single sitting, or spread across the first study visit (the first 90 days in the study). Later study visits take 20-40 minutes to complete depending on the visit and some of the responses you provide. As you take part in Fox Insight, you may also be invited to take part in other sub-studies or complete limited time surveys. All messaging about these will come through your study profile, and will describe the time commitment and any other steps you must take before you decide to take part. These sub-studies are all optional in addition to completing your routine study visits. Who can take part in Fox Insight? Anyone can take part in the study, including control volunteers without Parkinson’s, as these volunteers are essential to providing researchers with comparison data. Fox Insight also accepts participants from all around the world. I am a care partner. Can I complete Fox Insight Study Visits for someone with Parkinson’s? If you are a care partner for someone with Parkinson's, you can work together to complete Fox Insight Study Visits. Just make sure that you only input information about that person in their account including their personal information and most importantly, their PD status. If you are interested in enrolling in the Fox Insight study, here is how to get started:. 1. Visit the study homepage, www.foxinsight.org. 2. Click the orange “Register for Fox Insight” button to create your own account. 3. You’ll be immediately directed to consent to take part in the study. 4. You will then provide health-related information through a series of researcher-designed questionnaires on health related topics– from the comfort of your own home! What if I miss a Fox Insight Study Visit? If you are traveling or unable to complete a study visit for any reason, you will continue to be eligible for the rest of the study. We just ask that when your next study visit opens, you return to the site and continue to complete your questionnaires! Where can I learn more about PD research? If you’re interested in learning more about PD, PD research or developing a care team, we invite you to visit the MJFF website (michaeljfox.org) for information and connections to available resources about the disease. If you’re interested in learning about other PD studies in your area, we invite you to register for Fox Trial Finder (foxtrialfinder.org), a ‘match.com’-like platform for clinical trials.

Ideally your specialist should be a neuro. specialist in movement disorders. Most GP's would admit to knowing very little about the management of PD.. Anxiety is very common in Parkinsons and sometimes pre-dates the diagnosis. Most people, at whatever age, are very shocked at the PD diagnosis and your mother may be sparing you the worst of her fears especially if like me the only person I had known with PD was my mother-in-law years ago when the there was no treatment.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705622785808678607/Normal-datscan,-what-happens-next?	Normal datscan, what happens next?	Hi Andy, From my limited knowledge an MRI scan doesn't give a definitive diagnosis of PD but can rule out other neurological diseases. A DaTscan is also an imaging technology that uses small amounts of a radioactive drug to help determine how much dopamine is available in a person's brain. It's a machine similar to but smaller than an MRI machine. It measures the amount and location of the drug in the brain. I don't think DaTscans can definitely diagnose Parkinson's disease but are used to help a doctor confirm a diagnosis. The results of a DaTscan can be used to help rule out other diseases that may cause loss of dopamine in the brain. As far as I'm aware a DaTscan cannot differentiate between those diseases and Parkinson's but can give a very good indication. Push to see your Neurollogist ASAP. As you say, let's hope no news is good news! Jules77. 	1	1	Normal|datscan|,|what|happens|next|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715806475545702640/Severe-Tremors	Severe Tremors	Good Day Doctors,. I am 52 year old male. Have had Parkinson's for 8 years. I take 8-25/250 Sinemet at 7a-9a-11a-1p eat at 2p 20 grams of protein or less in my meal. Next pill at 7p-9p-11p-1a. At 1:30a I eat another meal more protein then carbs. About 30 grams. I weigh about 210lbs. I take Ducolax and a muti. nothing else. When I first started Sinemet I was on 5-25/100 per day. That was two years ago this month. Lately I have noticed the Sinemet seems not work well after I eat even if I wait 4 or 5 hours to take my pill and when they do start to work I seem to go into a tremor fit with both arms and sometimes both my legs and I it lasts about 5 minutes or less. Then come the dystonia in my right forearm and right foot toes. My question is why is my tremor so bad before the Sinemet kicks in? Are there any meds. that can help with the tremors? Also I noticed something else... when my 1pm med. wears off after I eat... about an hour later sometimes my right hand stops shaking and I am able to do things with it... this sometimes comes and goes and lasts about 10 to 15 minutes. Is this normal for Parkinson's?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4703170692530172710/NLRP3-Inflammasome-in-Parkinson's-Disease	NLRP3 Inflammasome in Parkinson's Disease	HOME › ABOUT THE FOUNDATION › FUNDED GRANTS ›. Target Validation, 2015. Objective/Rationale:. The goal of this proposal is to validate the NLRP3 inflammasome as a therapeutic target in Parkinson s disease. Unlike circulating inflammatory mediators whose complex functions are notoriously difficult to target, inflammasomes are intracellular initiators of inflammation. By validating the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome in central nervous system tissues from Parkinson s patients, we will inform emerging clinical trials of small molecule inflammasome inhibitors designed to suppress neuroinflammation during the progression of disease. Project Description:. To assess directly the activity of inflammasomes in the central nervous system (CNS) of Parkinson s disease patients, we will evaluate post-mortem tissues obtained at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and through collaboration with the Wisconsin Parkinson s Association. Using matched cryopreserved and fixed tissue specimens obtained from patients with Parkinson s disease we will conduct a dual biochemical and immunohistologic evaluation designed to characterize cellular and molecular manifestations of NLRP3 inflammasome activity. In so doing, we will also determine the cellular origins of NLRP3 activity in CNS tissues thereby providing a comprehensive characterization of NLRP3 activity in sporadic Parkinson s disease. Relevance to Diagnosis/Treatment of Parkinson s Disease:. Neuroinflammation is now recognized as a hallmark of Parkinson s disease, but this discovery has not yet resulted in the advancement of anti-inflammatory therapies designed to modify progressive neurodegeneration. By characterizing the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome in Parkinson s disease, we hope to provide a new platform from which to design, monitor and evaluate new diagnostic indicators and novel therapeutic targets. Anticipated Outcome:. Our goal is to block the progression of Parkinson s disease by suppressing neuroinflammation and the associated neurodegeneration prior to the development of debilitating motor and non-motor symptomology. Based upon new and exciting preliminary data, we anticipate this study will identify NLRP3 activation as a key pathologic mechanism in Parkinson s disease and thereby catapult forward the development of anti-inflammasome therapeutics for clinical trials in patients with Parkinson s disease. FINAL OUTCOME. Most molecules that promote inflammation do that by stimulating the cells from the outside. Unlike these traditional inflammatory mediators, inflammasomes initiate the inflammation from the inside the cell. One of the inflammasomes, NLRP3, initiates and perpetuates inflammation in response to cellular stress. In this study, we analyzed tissue samples and genetic data obtained from people with Parkinson's disease (PD) to determine whether the NLRP3 inflammasome represents a therapeutic target in PD. We found that, in some nerve cells, the levels of NLRP3 are higher in people with Parkinson's than in healthy people. This finding is important because it clarifies how distressed neurons contribute to brain inflammation in PD. To further investigate whether NLRP3 plays a role in PD, we analyzed genetic data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), a landmark study to find biomarkers -- disease indicators -- of Parkinson's disease. We identified a genetic abnormality in the NLRP3 gene whose presence was associated with a reduced risk of developing PD. Our studies clarify the role of NLRP3 in PD. They also provide a platform for improving our understanding of PD-associated inflammation and developing new therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating the activity of NLRP3 in Parkinson's disease.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715806350786793407/Let's-talk-dystonia.-I'll-show-you-mine,-if-you-show-me-yours	Let's talk dystonia. I'll show you mine, if you show me yours	"Let's talk dystonia. I'll show you mine, if you show me yours. Yup, Teresa and TNdad, same here. One of the first signs that Sinemet is wearing off is the return of dystonia. My MDS told me last year not to be afraid of taking Sinemet more frequently to limit the off times if the pain was getting too bad. My prescription is still for one pill, four times each day, but since my last dose now falls about 8:00 p.m., I will take an extra pill later if I go to bed late (New Year's Eve) or awake during the night and can't fall back to sleep faster than Parkinson's can turn back on. Also, if I am too active during the day and self-induce dystonia, I will take one-half a dose between full doses to free up my muscles again and help reduce the pain. (Disclaimer: you would have to ask your MDS about whether more frequent doses of Sinemet is right for you.). Looking back on my medical history, the first real clear sign of Parkinson's is what we now know was dystonia. My neck just froze up. A few months later the dam broke and released all of the other fun-house symptoms of Parkinson's that my then doctors said were ""just temporary and will go away soon."" They only got worse. Couple of other ""treatment"" options that I forgot: Ibuprofen and a soft cervical collar/brace. Ibuprofen helps me with the muscle pain. Before Sinemet, Ibuprofen was worthless to me as a pain killer. The only thing that halfway worked was the Norco I got from the ER after I busted up my face. After that, my doctors gave me prescriptions for the less potent Vicodin but I really didn't want to take that either for fear of addiction, and we still didn't really know what was going on. Since starting Sinemet, Ibuprofen now suddenly works (to varying degrees) to ease my muscle pain. The soft cervical collar I got from my mother after she had a surgery and wasn't allowed to move her neck for a few weeks. For me, it takes some of the load off my muscles that hold up my head. My neck tires less quickly. The head still wants to turn, but it's not as painful. I don't use the brace very often because I want my muscles to get the benefit of the exercise from holding my head up, but it comes in handy when I need to remain as pain free for as long as possible--so I can remain as politely sociable for as long as possible. TNdad, never thought I'd find another person with Parkinson's and secondary Tourette's! My MDS laughed when I told him Parkinson's gave me Tourette's. He said he understood. It opened up new areas of discussion between us. Other physicians I've told that to just have no understanding of Parkinson's, or sense of humor. Swimmer, yes I've heard that DBS is touted to help with dystonia, but I only hear about it in situations where someone has dystonia in one focal point of the body, not multiple. Like the Botox injections, I'm sort of concerned about the number of surgeries and especially the number of stimulators that would have to be inserted into someone's brain to control so many varied muscles, though I have not asked my MDS and he has not mentioned it either.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693918742336869029/Does-dance-help-with-Parkinson's-symptoms?	Does dance help with Parkinson's symptoms?	Yes, dance does help with Parkinson's symptoms! It has been widely observed and there has been much research to support this view. One of the distinctions that should be made between the types of 'dance' for people with Parkinson's is in the balance between pure physiotherapy and sheer enjoyment. These elements are not mutually exclusive. The UK Dance for Parkinson's network is a collection of teachers and interested parties across the UK who have benfitted in some way from the Dance for PD Programme set up 10 years ago by Mark Morris Dance Group and Brooklyn Parkinson's Group. This Programme is widely accepted as the most advanced of its kind. Not only does the movement have benefits for the particpants but it is an enjoyable experience with real dancers in a real dance environment, live music and to one which partners and caregivers are invited. It is a real dance class. Rather than explain more here, if your interested have a look at http://danceforparkinsons.org. Some of the UK network is listed on this site and includes ballet, modern and tango based classes. It is not an exhaustive list and others teaching dance to people with Parkinson's are invited to join in this collaboration to share experiences in order to extend the provision of dance to more Parkinson's sufferers. The site also includes a list of the research already done in this field. The most recent is an excellent study by University of Roehampton and English National Ballet. More details are on http://www.ballet.org.uk/learning/dance-for-parkinsons-an-investigative-study.html. 	1	1	Does|dance|help|with|Parkinson's|symptoms|?

He sleeps few minutes, wakes up, walks and tries to sleep again without success. I've read here cbd oil helps to relax and sleep. We have gotten some cbd oil 5% from cbd Brothers and my father started taking some drops 3 days ago. We have not seen any effects yet, but I've been told it takes a time to work. Let's see. I know insomnia is difficult. If you take the oil talk to your doctor first because it shouldn't be taken with some anti depressants. Be patient until you find the best meds for you.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715785497654857058/Going-it-alone	Going it alone	Thank you Joanne for the advice and information. I would willingly discuss taking Macuna Pruriens with ANY health professional, if I could find one to talk to about the subject! As Sheila says, neurologists and PD nurses have either never heard of it, or just dismiss the whole idea of taking alternative supplements, out of hand. Many of us want the choice to decide for ourselves and are desperate for some expert advice from someone who can advise us properly about taking MC. Surely there must be some neurologist, somewhere who has looked into this. After all MC has been around for centuries and proved a very effective method of relieving symptoms of Parkinson's, in India. I have spent hours trawling through information on the Internet, trying to find a reliable provider of Macuna. I always contact the manufacturer to get more information, before I buy the product. You need to know how much L-Dopa you are taking in each type of preparation.....be it powder, capsule or tablet. I think it is scandalous that we cannot get proper help with this topic and have to experiment ourselves and pass on information to each other, as we do.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4701375688008374182/Call-for-participants-for-our-clinical-trial-of-GDNF	Call for participants for our clinical trial of GDNF	Hi everyone As you know we are currently supporting a cutting-edge drug trial of a drug called GDNF which has great potential for people with Parkinson's. We have already successfully recruited a number of people with Parkinson's to take part in this ground-breaking trial but we still need more people to come forward – especially those within relatively easy reach of Bristol, where the study is taking place. Please help us make this trial successful by reading the information below and passing the information on to anyone who may be interested in the study. Aim: To test whether a drug called GDNF has the potential to slow the course of Parkinson's, which is something no current treatment can do. Who do the researchers need? People aged between 35-75 who have had Parkinson's for at least 5 years. You need to meet a range of specific criteria to be eligible and be able to travel regularly to Bristol. What is involved? This is a clinical trial of a new treatment for Parkinson's so taking part involves in-depth assessments, complex surgery and regular visits to the research centre in Bristol for treatment and follow-up visits. Background This £2million trial is funded by Parkinson's UK, with support from the Cure Parkinson's Trust and in association with the North Bristol NHS Trust. Because GDNF is a large protein it's quite difficult to get it into the brain. In this trial participants will have surgery to implant a device that can deliver GDNF directly into the right area of the brain. The researchers are looking for 36 people with Parkinson's, preferably living within easy reach of Bristol, to take part in this 9-month trial. Who can take part? As well as being aged between 35-75 and having Parkinson's for at least 5 years, to be a suitable candidate you must also experience problems with your Parkinson's medication - in particular, 'off' periods, when the medication stops working and symptoms become severe. People who have previously had Deep Brain Stimulation, experience severe tremor or dyskinesia, or who have dementia or significant mood problems are not suitable to take part in this study. All reasonable expenses incurred while taking part in the study will be fully reimbursed. Taking part in this study is a significant commitment as it involves regular visits to Bristol for assessments, surgery, brain scans and treatment. Interested in taking part? For further information please read the full details available on our website carefully and watch the videos to get a full understanding of what the study involves: www.parkinsons.org.uk/gdnf If you decide you'd be interested in participating in the study and think you may be a suitable candidate please contact the Parkinson's UK research team directly: [email protected] or on 0207 963 9326.

Systemic Synuclein Sampling Study (S4). An Observational Study to Identify the Best Biofluid(s) and Tissue(s) for Measuring Alpha-Synuclein Outside the Brain as a Potential Biomarker of Parkinsonâ  s Disease. Recruitment Information:. Seeking volunteers with following diagnosis: Only Controls Study Type: Observational. Eligible Ages: 40 - 100 Status: Completed. Time Since Diagnosis: Any may be eligible Study Focus:. Study Purpose:. The Systemic Synuclein Sampling Study (S4) is an observational clinical study to develop biomarkers to measure progression of Parkinsonâ  s disease (PD). A biomarker is a substance or characteristic in our bodies that is associated with the presence of disease or that changes over time in a way that can be linked to the progression of disease. Biomarkers are valuable tools to help confirm a diagnosis, track disease progression and testing the effectiveness of new therapies. Currently there is no validated biomarker for PD, making this an important study to move forward the development of biomarkers. More Details ▼. Currently, one of the most promising biomarkers for PD is alpha-synuclein â   a protein that clumps in the brains of people with Parkinsonâ  s. We do not yet have a way to measure alpha-synuclein in the brain, but this protein can also be measured in bodily fluids and tissues, offering an alternative route to potentially monitor changes in the disease. The goal of S4 is to identify the best biofluid(s) and tissue(s) for measuring alpha-synuclein outside of the brain as a potential biomarker of Parkinsonâ  s disease.Â. S4 is an observational study, which means participants will undergo tests and assessments and will provide biologic samples. Study volunteers will not receive an experimental drug or treatment.Â.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4593436987124841914/drug-interactions-|	drug interactions |	Today, I had two old, mercury amalgam patched gold crowns removed. They said they took out a LOT of Mercury amalgam from under the crown. They will replace them with Zirconium crowns that the man who analyzes the Clifford tests suggested to my dentist. That man at Clifford would also be very interesting to interview. He has a wealth of info about compatible dental materials. Another issue is the difficulty that epinephrine can cause. One woman new to our support group never had a tremor until recently when she was given pain killer containing epinephrine and she has not stopped having tremors since that dental appointment. Another woman said her “Parkinson's” began at a dentist appointment. Our group leader asked his dentist who had been to a special conference where they said not to use Novocaine with epinephrine with people who have neurological challenges. Another man was given a copy of the printed info that comes with both kinds of pain killer. Today my dentist gave me plain Novocaine without epinephrine. After 2 hours of sitting while they worked I was shaky all over but it did go away. It felt like it might be my body adjusting to the big clump of amalgam leaving. I feel much better tonight. I strongly feel people with Parkinson's or a pre-disposition (heredity) should be informed about this issue and choice. My dentist said they keep both kinds of pain killer available because there are people who are sensitive. (Also, the dermatologist uses pain killer with epinephrine and could be asked to use a non-epinephrine alternative.). What are others learning about this issue? Karen.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4577466576663377972/Abyraz	Abyraz	"NOTICE: This Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) is intended for persons living in Australia. ABYRAZ. aripiprazole. Consumer Medicine Information. What is in this leaflet. This leaflet answers some common questions about ABYRAZ. It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist. All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking ABYRAZ against the benefits they expect it will have for you. If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again. What ABYRAZ is used for. ABYRAZ contains the active ingredient aripiprazole (ari-pip-rah-zol). ABYRAZ belongs to a group of medicines called antipsychotic agents which improve the symptoms of certain types of mental illness. ABYRAZ is used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a mental illness with disturbances in thinking, feelings or behaviour. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason. There is no evidence that this medicine is addictive. This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription. ABYRAZ is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18, as safety and efficacy have not been established in this age group. Before you take ABYRAZ. When you must not take it. Do not take ABYRAZ if you have an allergy to:. any medicine containing aripiprazole. any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet. Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include:. shortness of breath. wheezing or difficulty breathing. swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body. rash, itching or hives on the skin. Do not take this medicine after the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. If it has expired or is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal. If you are not sure whether you should start taking this medicine, talk to your doctor. Before you start to take it. Tell your doctor if you have allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes. Tell your doctor if you have or have had any of the following medical conditions:. use dot points to list relevant conditions as per PI. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Your doctor can discuss with you the risks and benefits involved. ABYRAZ is not recommended for use during pregnancy. If you need to take ABYRAZ during your pregnancy, your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and risks of taking this medicine. Babies exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk of experiencing shaking, muscle stiffness, difficulty in feeding and/or withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms may resolve spontaneously or require additional medical treatment. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. It is recommended that you do not breast feed while taking ABYRAZ as it may pass into the breast milk and therefore there is a possibility that the breast-fed baby may be affected. Tell your doctor if you have, or have had, any medical conditions, especially the following:. a reaction to some medicines with a sudden increase in body temperature, sweating, fast heartbeat, muscle stiffness and fluctuating blood pressure, which may lead to coma. This reaction is called neuroleptic malignant syndrome. a reaction to some medicines with abnormal movements of the tongue, or other uncontrolled movements of the mouth, tongue, cheeks or jaw which may progress to the arms and legs. This reaction is called tardive dyskinesia. low blood pressure. problems with your heart or blood vessels. epilepsy, seizures or fits. problems with your oesophagus (food pipe) such as difficulty swallowing. high blood sugar or diabetes mellitus. Alzheimer's disease or dementia. alcohol or drug abuse or dependence or a history of one of these. venous thromboembolism or are at risk of venous thromboembolism. lactose intolerance. Tell your doctor if you drink alcohol. Your doctor may advise you to avoid alcohol as it can magnify the side effects of this medicine. If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell them before you start taking ABYRAZ. Taking other medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Some medicines and ABYRAZ may interfere with each other. These include:. medicines used to treat brain disorders such as anxiety, depression, mood swings, epilepsy or seizures, Parkinson's disease or insomnia. medicines used to treat high blood pressure. medicines used to treat fungal infections. medicines used to treat heart rhythm disturbances. medicines used to treat bacterial or viral infections. a medicine called ciclosporin (Neoral ® ; Sandimmun ® ). a medicine called cimetidine (Magicul). These medicines may be affected by ABYRAZ or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicines, or you may need to take different medicines. Eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice may affect how ABYRAZ works. Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking this medicine. How to take ABYRAZ. Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet. If you do not understand the instructions on the pack, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help. How much to take. Your doctor will tell you how much you need to take each day. This will depend on your condition and whether you are taking any other medicines. How to take it. Swallow the tablets whole with a full glass of water. When to take it. Take your medicine at about the same time each day. Unless your doctor gives you other directions, you should take ABYRAZ only once a day. Taking it at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take it. It does not matter if you take this medicine with or without food. How long to take it. Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you. This medicine helps to control your condition, but does not cure it. Improvement in symptoms may take several days to some weeks to occur. It is important to keep taking your medicine even if you feel well unless your doctor tells you to. If you forget to take it. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally. Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist. If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints. If you take too much (overdose). Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) for advice, or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much ABYRAZ. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention. While you are using ABYRAZ. Things you must do. If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking ABYRAZ. Tell any other doctors, dentists, and pharmacists who treat you that you are taking this medicine. If you are going to have surgery, tell the surgeon or anaesthetist that you are taking this medicine. If you become pregnant while taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately. Keep all of your doctor's appointments so that your progress can be checked. Things you must not do. Do not take ABYRAZ to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to. Do not give your medicine to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you. Do not stop taking your medicine or lower the dosage without checking with your doctor. If you stop taking it suddenly, your condition may worsen. Things to be careful of. Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how ABYRAZ affects you. ABYRAZ may cause some people to become drowsy or less alert than they are normally or cause light-headedness, dizziness or tiredness. If this occurs do not undertake the activity. If ABYRAZ makes you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint, be careful when getting up from a sitting or lying position. Standing up slowly, especially when you get up from bed or chairs, will help your body get used to the change in position and blood pressure. If this problem continues or gets worse, talk to your doctor. Be careful when drinking alcohol while you are taking this medicine. Your doctor may suggest you avoid alcohol while you are being treated with ABYRAZ. Make sure you keep cool in hot weather and keep warm in cool weather. ABYRAZ may affect the way your body reacts to temperature changes. It may prevent sweating, even during heatwaves. You may feel dizzy or faint if you are too hot. To stay cool in hot weather, try to do the following:. wear light clothing. spend time in air-conditioned environments (or keep windows open and use electric fans). drink plenty of water. take cool baths or showers and avoid hot baths and saunas. try to restrict exercise or heavy work to cool parts of the day. Side effects. Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking ABYRAZ. Like other medicines, ABYRAZ may cause some unwanted side effects. These are likely to vary from patient to patient. ABYRAZ is generally well-tolerated and the side effects are often hard to distinguish from disease symptoms. It is important to tell your doctor as soon as possible about unwanted side effects. You may need medical attention if you get some of the side effects. Do not be alarmed by the following lists of side effects. You may not experience any of them. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the following and they worry you:. headache. indigestion. nausea. vomiting. constipation. insomnia. drowsiness. light-headedness. anxiety. agitation. inability to sit or stand still; restless movement of the arms and legs such as tapping, marching in places, rocking, crossing and uncrossing the legs. The above list includes the more common side effects of your medicine. The following are very rare side effects:. weight gain. weight loss. loss of appetite. excessive sweating. Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any of the following:. feeling dizzy, especially when getting up from a lying or sitting position. chest pain. frequent infections such as fever, severe chills, sore throat or mouth ulcers. bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. signs of high blood sugar (e.g. excessive thirst, increased appetite with weight loss, feeling tired, weakness and passing lots of urine) or the onset or worsening of diabetes. difficulty in speaking or slurred speech. urinary incontinence. difficulty swallowing. If any of the following happen, tell your doctor immediately or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital:. seizure, fits or convulsions. fainting. abnormal movements of the tongue or other uncontrolled movements of the tongue, mouth, cheeks or jaw which may progress to the arms and legs. sudden increase in body temperature, sweating, fast heartbeat, muscle stiffness, high blood pressure and convulsions. sudden drop in body temperature. rash. allergic reaction. muscle pain, muscle weakness or muscle stiffness. severe upper stomach pain often with nausea and vomiting (may be a sign of inflammation of the pancreas). painful irreversible erection. difficulty in passing urine. yellowing of the skin and/or eyes, also called jaundice, with or without nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, feeling generally unwell, fever, itching and dark coloured urine. serious lung infection with fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain and blood streaked phlegm. thoughts or talk about death or suicide; thoughts or talk about self-harm or doing harm to others; any recent attempts at self-harm; an increase in aggressive behaviour, irritability or agitation. If you or someone you know if showing these signs contact your doctor or a mental health advisor right away or go to the nearest hospital for treatment. The above list includes very serious side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice anything that is making you feel unwell. Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some people. While taking ABYRAZ, some elderly patients with dementia have suffered serious side effects such as a ""mini"" stroke, stroke, pneumonia or heart problems. These serious side effects can be life threatening. After using ABYRAZ. Storage. Keep your tablets in the pack until it is time to take them. If you take the tablets out of the pack they may not keep well. Keep your tablets in a cool dry place where the temperature stays below 25°C. Do not store ABYRAZ or any other medicine in the bathroom or near a sink. Do not leave it on a window sill or in the car. Heat and dampness can destroy some medicines. Keep it where children cannot reach it. A locked cupboard at least one-and-a-half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines. Disposal.

Chan, DDS, MICCMO Today, our dental professions diagnostic paradigms are evolving beyond only identification of dental caries, marginal breakdown of old fillings and crowns, root canal lesions, fractured teeth and periodontal breakdown. These basic dental problems are often only indications of a more hidden muscular, occlusal and temporomandibular joint problem that go often undetected, even within the medical and dental profession. TMJ/TMD is a problem that is not easily seen by cursory dental x-ray and intra-oral evaluation. It presents with many signs and symptoms that can mimic other medical and dental problems as vascular disorders, brain tumors, aneurisms, cervical disc disorders, throat and oral cancer, etc."" and also this site: http://www.tmjscale.com/general-tmj-info/ All you ever wanted to know about TMJ and comes with on line self assessment tool (for a cost).

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693919505931790635/TMJ-for-Parkinsons	TMJ for Parkinsons	I have been researching Parkinson's treatments for my wife who has had PD for around 12 years. In the last five years or so I have taken 3 other alternative treatments to Parkinson's UK, they were unaware of. This is the fourth and I alerted PDUK this week, and my wife and I are currently visiting TMJ practitioners to decide which one to use for my wife's treatment. TMJ is a disorder of the jaw joint and is extremely common. By realigning the jaw through the non invasive treatment of creating a plate which fits over the lower teeth, the imbalance can be corrected. The jaw joint is the most complex and important in the body, though apparently few Doctors are aware of the problems misalignment can cause. It may even be that since the symptoms of this condition entirely parallel the symptoms of Parkinson's a few, some or even many Parkinson's diagnoses are mistaken!! This treatment has been taking place in the USA for about five years and there seem to be three leading Orthodontists doing it. Below are a series of videos readily available on U tube about this condition and showing extraordinary and almost instantaneous changes in balance and walking having been fitted with one of the these plates. Dr. Dwight Jennings one of these Othodontists told me he thought about 300 people had been treated in the USA who had Parkinson's with a 70-80% success rate. To date I know of only 4 people in the UK and the success rate by the Orthodontist who did it, is put at 50%.THIS IS NOT A CURE! It is a way of greatly alleviating some of the most unpleasant motor symptoms. The videos below are bu a selection of those available but they show clearly the kind of improvements which can be produced. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXVR423Xlpchttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnVI-nPYkNk&list=UU44UOUJtqfyXr42JwzarWRAhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no0ifu7Yzo4&list=UU44UOUJtqfyXr42JwzarWRAhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be5P-el6sXA&list=UU44UOUJtqfyXr42JwzarWRAhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlax-XFowS4&list=UU44UOUJtqfyXr42JwzarWRAhttp://tmjstack.com/I have already alerted those at the top of Parkinson's Uk to this discovery and this time they seem to be taking it more seriously. However your voice matters, and if like me, you can see that this would be a valuable asset to current treatments, add your voice to mine in requesting urgent action and research to be funded by Parkinson's UK. An article by Dr. Jennings, can be found on the website I created, www.positiveparkinsons.com under Latest News 3.Why haven't we known about this before? Because this treatment is primarily dental in origin, it falls in a gap and the medical profession simply haven't considered it. Furthermore because nearly all the major Parkinson's organisations are focused so much on drugs, anything 'alternative' is given short shrift. In the US I know from conversations with Dr. Jennings that it has been equally difficult to get known and heard. Scepticism is natural and I am the first to be doubtful. However all I have discovered convinces me there is for once a non invasive treatment which really may be able to help PD patients. 	1	1	TMJ|for|Parkinsons	I|have|been|researching|Parkinson's|treatments|for|my|wife|who|has|had|PD|for|around|12|years|.|In|the|last|five|years|or|so|I|have|taken|3|other|alternative|treatments|to|Parkinson's|UK|,|they|were|unaware|of|.|This|is|the|fourth|and|I|alerted|PDUK|this|week|,|and|my|wife|and|I|are|currently|visiting|TMJ|practitioners|to|decide|which|one|to|use|for|my|wife's|treatment|.|TMJ|is|a|disorder|of|the|jaw|joint|and|is|extremely|common|.|By|realigning|the|jaw|through|the|non|invasive|treatment|of|creating|a|plate|which|fits|over|the|lower|teeth|,|the|imbalance|can|be|corrected|.|The|jaw|joint|is|the|most|complex|and|important|in|the|body|,|though|apparently|few|Doctors|are|aware|of|the|problems|misalignment|can|cause|.|It|may|even|be|that|since|the|symptoms|of|this|condition|entirely|parallel|the|symptoms|of|Parkinson's|a|few|,|some|or|even|many|Parkinson's|diagnoses|are|mistaken|!|!|This|treatment|has|been|taking|place|in|the|USA|for|about|five|years|and|there|seem|to|be|three|leading|Orthodontists|doing|it|.|Below|are|a|series|of|videos|readily|available|on|U|tube|about|this|condition|and|showing|extraordinary|and|almost|instantaneous|changes|in|balance|and|walking|having|been|fitted|with|one|of|the|these|plates|.|Dr|.|Dwight|Jennings|one|of|these|Othodontists|told|me|he|thought|about|300|people|had|been|treated|in|the|USA|who|had|Parkinson's|with|a|70-80|%|success|rate|.|To|date|I|know|of|only|4|people|in|the|UK|and|the|success|rate|by|the|Orthodontist|who|did|it|,|is|put|at|50|%|.|THIS|IS|NOT|A|CURE|!|It|is|a|way|of|greatly|alleviating|some|of|the|most|unpleasant|motor|symptoms|.|The|videos|below|are|bu|a|selection|of|those|available|but|they|show|clearly|the|kind|of|improvements|which|can|be|produced|.|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXVR423Xlpchttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnVI-nPYkNk&list=UU44UOUJtqfyXr42JwzarWRAhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no0ifu7Yzo4&list=UU44UOUJtqfyXr42JwzarWRAhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be5P-el6sXA&list=UU44UOUJtqfyXr42JwzarWRAhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlax-XFowS4&list=UU44UOUJtqfyXr42JwzarWRAhttp://tmjstack.com/I|have|already|alerted|those|at|the|top|of|Parkinson's|Uk|to|this|discovery|and|this|time|they|seem|to|be|taking|it|more|seriously|.|However|your|voice|matters|,|and|if|like|me|,|you|can|see|that|this|would|be|a|valuable|asset|to|current|treatments|,|add|your|voice|to|mine|in|requesting|urgent|action|and|research|to|be|funded|by|Parkinson's|UK|.|An|article|by|Dr|.|Jennings|,|can|be|found|on|the|website|I|created|,|www.positiveparkinsons.com|under|Latest|News|3.Why|haven't|we|known|about|this|before|?|Because|this|treatment|is|primarily|dental|in|origin|,|it|falls|in|a|gap|and|the|medical|profession|simply|haven't|considered|it|.|Furthermore|because|nearly|all|the|major|Parkinson's|organisations|are|focused|so|much|on|drugs|,|anything|'|alternative|'|is|given|short|shrift|.|In|the|US|I|know|from|conversations|with|Dr|.|Jennings|that|it|has|been|equally|difficult|to|get|known|and|heard|.|Scepticism|is|natural|and|I|am|the|first|to|be|doubtful|.|However|all|I|have|discovered|convinces|me|there|is|for|once|a|non|invasive|treatment|which|really|may|be|able|to|help|PD|patients|.

I am 47y/o-my symptoms began to worsen after the death of my 21y/o daughter(in picture with me from Brugada disease-rare heart disease that can cause sudden death).I kept trying to convince myself my symptoms(slowed movements left sided,sleep disturbances,etc) were due to the depression. Than began to have balance issues and left thumb tremors before finally going to doctor. I am still working full-time-youngest child is now 18-best advice is to exercise,keep moving whether waking,riding,swiming,gardening,etc-helps alot. I do take selgeline and vitamins/herbals-green tea also. Some days I wake up and all I can think is""I have Parkinson's"".But have to remind myself not to let my thoughts control me. My 18y/o son has had difficulties with all of this. With death of his sister we were genetically tested for brugada and he and myself also carry the gene and at the same time as my PD diagnosis my husband was disabled at work due to a spinal injury. Life throws us speed bumps-you just have drive around them and find a new normal. For me the worst are the non motor symptoms of extreme fatigue,constipation and sleep disorder. Exercise does help with the fatigue when i'm not to tired to exercise lol!. We have no known family history of PD-also had no known family history of Brugada-lots of wonderful sites for information about the motor and non motor symptoms of PD. Knowledge has helped me cope. It is difficult not knowing what to expect progression wise as we all experience PD differently but knowing the motor and non motor symptoms has helped me understand the disease better not only for myself but for the patients I work with(home care nurse).Explaining to kids that mommy is sick and may not always be able to do everything you used to do helps also. My son was 13 when he and I noticed symptoms-also 13 when his sister passed and he has been very supportive most of the time and understanding when I am to tired or muscle/joint pain or stiffness keeps me from doing the same things with him I used to do. My job is aware because I chose to disclose but they don't seem to care and at present it doesn't interfere to much with my ability to work-other than the exhaustion. Support groups help for some people but difficult to schedule going to around work,kids,life in general! Thoughts and prayers for you and your family.

I'm 29 years old and have been displaying some neurological symptoms for about two years. I'm losing my mind not knowing for certain what is going on. The symptom that pointed me to Parkinsons was reduced arm swing in the right arm and now my right foot scuffs the floor. I move slower than i used to (i used to dance) and i just have fatigue all the time. I've been treated for essential tremor, but it is not an action tremor, it will mostly only move when my hand is sitting there. It does make it hard to text and type. I have bipolar disorder as well, and starting me on antipsychotics greatly amplified the slowness and feeling of apathy. Over the past two years I've become a recluse, haven't had much of a social life and haven't been able to study like i used to. The non-neuro doctors I've spoken with tell me it isn't Parkinsons because i don't have rigidity and the tremor isn't a full pill-rolling tremor. I've got a scheduled appointment with an MDS, but it is 4 months away. It's killing me feeling my body and mind change and not have any answers. 	1	1	Lost|waiting|for|a|diagnosis	My|name|is|Christian|an|I'm|new|to|posting|on|the|forums|,|but|have|been|reading|for|a|while|now|.|I'm|29|years|old|and|have|been|displaying|some|neurological|symptoms|for|about|two|years|.|I'm|losing|my|mind|not|knowing|for|certain|what|is|going|on|.|The|symptom|that|pointed|me|to|Parkinsons|was|reduced|arm|swing|in|the|right|arm|and|now|my|right|foot|scuffs|the|floor|.|I|move|slower|than|i|used|to|(|i|used|to|dance|)|and|i|just|have|fatigue|all|the|time|.|I've|been|treated|for|essential|tremor|,|but|it|is|not|an|action|tremor|,|it|will|mostly|only|move|when|my|hand|is|sitting|there|.|It|does|make|it|hard|to|text|and|type|.|I|have|bipolar|disorder|as|well|,|and|starting|me|on|antipsychotics|greatly|amplified|the|slowness|and|feeling|of|apathy|.|Over|the|past|two|years|I've|become|a|recluse|,|haven't|had|much|of|a|social|life|and|haven't|been|able|to|study|like|i|used|to|.|The|non-neuro|doctors|I've|spoken|with|tell|me|it|isn't|Parkinsons|because|i|don't|have|rigidity|and|the|tremor|isn't|a|full|pill-rolling|tremor|.|I've|got|a|scheduled|appointment|with|an|MDS|,|but|it|is|4|months|away|.|It's|killing|me|feeling|my|body|and|mind|change|and|not|have|any|answers|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693737623547978864/I'm-at-a-loss	I'm at a loss	A strong family history of parkinsonism suggests the presence of genetic parkinsonism, thus arguing against idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Genetic parkinsonism may manifest with a variety of clinical syndromes. Its commonest form, especially among patients with young onset disease, is parkin disease, which is caused by mutations of the parkin gene. 	1	1	I'm|at|a|loss	A|strong|family|history|of|parkinsonism|suggests|the|presence|of|genetic|parkinsonism|,|thus|arguing|against|idiopathic|Parkinson's|disease|(|IPD|)|.|Genetic|parkinsonism|may|manifest|with|a|variety|of|clinical|syndromes|.|Its|commonest|form|,|especially|among|patients|with|young|onset|disease|,|is|parkin|disease|,|which|is|caused|by|mutations|of|the|parkin|gene|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693738857471894001/Post-of-the-Week:-Neuropsychiatric-Effects-of-Parkinson's-Treatments	Post of the Week: Neuropsychiatric Effects of Parkinson's Treatments	I am hoping to find information on this forum to help guide me in caring for my father, who is suffering from Parkinsons. Over the past year my father has developed new onset behaviors that I believe are related to either parkinsons dementia or dopaminergic side effects. The symptoms include compulsive behavior and hypersexuality. To be more specific, he is making contact with strangers and arranging to meet with them. He meets them through online dating sites or through telephone services. Generally these people express a need for financial assistance. It is of great concern to my family to keep him safe, however it has become extremely difficult to attempt to stop these behaviors without limiting his freedom. It is really tearing my family appart. We are afraid one day he will leave and not return. The activity described above has been reported to his neurologist who stop prescribing Requip to him. This worked for a short time but he was simply unable to live with the tremors without having something. He currently takes the following meds:. Amantadine 100 mg Capsules 2 per day. Carbidopa-Levodopa 25-100 TAB 8 per day. Carbidopa/levo ER 25-100 TAB 8 per day (He takes two different Carbidopa Levo. Azilect 1 MG Tab 1 per day. Verapamil ER 240 MG TAB 1 per day. Carbamazepine 200 MG TAB 2 per day (This is the tegretol he took for Trigeminal Neuralgia, but still takes 2 per day.). Valsartin-HCTZ 160-12.5 MG TAB 1 per day. Hydrocodon-Acetaminophen 5-500 only as needed. Doesn't take regularly. I feel that we can not continue the therapy as prescribed now and am hoping for any advice possible. He refuses to go through psychoanalysis. His neurologist now beleives he is suffering from Parkinsons dementia. The behaviors are becoming increasingly more dangerous. I need expert advice. Dr. Okun, if you are reading my message I would like to mention that I also am involved in healthcare at Shands UF. Any help you can give me through the forum would be much appreciated. I would be more than happy to arrange to speak with you if you are ever available, however my father does not live here in town and he can not proceed with formal patient consultation at this time. Just looking for help.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4596539092557388943/Parkinson-Related?	Parkinson Related?	For the past 2 years I have been experiencing pain in my right & left groin area. Approx. 5 years ago I had a hernia operation on my right side. After seeing several doctors regarding this current pain, and after a Cat Scan and ultra sounds the doctors (my reg. MD & a surgeon) do not see anything that could be causing the pain. One dr. suggested it may be a nerve that was affected by the hernia operation. The pain I am experiencing is not constant, but comes and goes. Last night I experienced the pain on both sides of the groin area, and pain in my lower back. Do you think that this pain is associated with my Parkinsons? I have had PD for over 17 years, and am being treated with Sinemet CR, regular Sinemet and Comtan. I take this medication 5 times a day at 4 hour intervals. The Senemet CR is taken only in the morning and at night. Please advise what you think may be causing this pain.

I really am on my way back from a weekend out of town AFTER the conference I attended. I decided to take a side trip to visit with someone I had met about a year ago while on vacation. Mr Business and I met purely by accident and have been emailing for quite a while. I decided, since I was in the same general part of the country, to visit his city. I have never really had the opportunity to do the tourist thing there. And, I figured, as a bonus, I could sightsee with a local. Plus, since Mr Business already knows about my PD, I figured this would be a relatively pressure-free weekend. Well, it was and it wasn't. Mr Business turned out to be nothing but business. Very much in the mode of Ayn Rand's Objectivism. This included his approach to relationships: Relationships have value to him only if they are in his self-interest. What this translated into was his belief that if I flew all the way over to his city, it must be because I wanted a little ""action."" Um, no. In fact, putting it that way, hell no! Of course, this makes it sound like we had a discussion. We did not. He asked, I said no; I went back to my hotel, he said he'd call for me in the morning; morning arrived, he never did. (I knew he was ok because later that evening he accidentally pocket- called me and I heard his voice!) And that was just fine with me. Cross that one off my list! Fortunately, PD has neither affected my judgment nor diminished my self-worth. In the end, I had a very nice weekend hanging out with myself. As an aside:. Dgray, I understand what you are going through. You are likely fatigued and unhappy. You need to reset your perspective. All of that is draining. But over time, you will find that you will either roll with the PD or fight it. You will choose the course that suits you best. So give yourself a little time and allow yourself a large measure of kindness. They are announcing my flight--time to look and act particularly Parkie so I can board with the others who need ""a little extra time""....

I am not sure that my employer will accommodate my disability,If I disclose my health status. I am about to inform my employer tomorrow that I will be applying for SSDI.

Do you driving,while you are on sinemet? If so,how often and have you ever experience sleep attacks while driving? All these parkinson meds have horrible side effects.. I am currently on leave from work,to allow me try some dopamine agonist and see how it affects me.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693739374862185575/Young-Adult-Children-and-my-Parkinson's	Young Adult Children and my Parkinson's	Delta- Thank you for your update. I hope the knee surgery gives you the results you hope for! I am wondering if you and your husband and children are getting counseling? I am guessing that some of what you are dealing with is compounded by the PD diagnosis but may have begun even before the diagnosis. Relationships are challenging enough even without PD. I am also wondering if there might be a support group for you as well as some of your willing family members. There isn't going to be some magic solution to your problems (I'm sure you didn't expect that) but it is going to require some hard work that may require a professional to facilitate. Read all that you can in the meantime. Find books about dealing with chronic illness, relationships with your adult children and about marriage. Don't give up. If your children won't talk to you then send them a quick note of encouragement. Be brief in your note and focus on their lives instead of your own situation. Let them know you care about them. Tell your daughter you are excited that she is going to be able to live in Spain and that you hope she will send you lots of pictures and stories about it. Tell her you'll miss her during her spring break but you're happy she has good friends to spend her break with. I think the years during college are typically spent trying to be independent and that means parents feel ignored except when their kids need money. My 19 year old is in the very same stage. I miss him but I think it is normal that he doesn't share his life with me. I know your pain is real but try to evaluate how much of what you are dealing with might be simply part of having independent adult children. That is where counseling may be important in helping you with your grieving. Even though you may not feel like they care about you, they probably need to be reminded that you care about them. I know it is depressing and lonely. I know it is hard. I am sorry it is so hard. Sometimes life is painful. I hope you have a bright spot in your day today. Some days you have to look really hard to find the bright spot. Keep looking! 	1	1	Young|Adult|Children|and|my|Parkinson's	Delta|-|Thank|you|for|your|update|.|I|hope|the|knee|surgery|gives|you|the|results|you|hope|for|!|I|am|wondering|if|you|and|your|husband|and|children|are|getting|counseling|?|I|am|guessing|that|some|of|what|you|are|dealing|with|is|compounded|by|the|PD|diagnosis|but|may|have|begun|even|before|the|diagnosis|.|Relationships|are|challenging|enough|even|without|PD|.|I|am|also|wondering|if|there|might|be|a|support|group|for|you|as|well|as|some|of|your|willing|family|members|.|There|isn't|going|to|be|some|magic|solution|to|your|problems|(|I'm|sure|you|didn't|expect|that|)|but|it|is|going|to|require|some|hard|work|that|may|require|a|professional|to|facilitate|.|Read|all|that|you|can|in|the|meantime|.|Find|books|about|dealing|with|chronic|illness|,|relationships|with|your|adult|children|and|about|marriage|.|Don't|give|up|.|If|your|children|won't|talk|to|you|then|send|them|a|quick|note|of|encouragement|.|Be|brief|in|your|note|and|focus|on|their|lives|instead|of|your|own|situation|.|Let|them|know|you|care|about|them|.|Tell|your|daughter|you|are|excited|that|she|is|going|to|be|able|to|live|in|Spain|and|that|you|hope|she|will|send|you|lots|of|pictures|and|stories|about|it|.|Tell|her|you'll|miss|her|during|her|spring|break|but|you're|happy|she|has|good|friends|to|spend|her|break|with|.|I|think|the|years|during|college|are|typically|spent|trying|to|be|independent|and|that|means|parents|feel|ignored|except|when|their|kids|need|money|.|My|19|year|old|is|in|the|very|same|stage|.|I|miss|him|but|I|think|it|is|normal|that|he|doesn't|share|his|life|with|me|.|I|know|your|pain|is|real|but|try|to|evaluate|how|much|of|what|you|are|dealing|with|might|be|simply|part|of|having|independent|adult|children|.|That|is|where|counseling|may|be|important|in|helping|you|with|your|grieving|.|Even|though|you|may|not|feel|like|they|care|about|you|,|they|probably|need|to|be|reminded|that|you|care|about|them|.|I|know|it|is|depressing|and|lonely|.|I|know|it|is|hard|.|I|am|sorry|it|is|so|hard|.|Sometimes|life|is|painful|.|I|hope|you|have|a|bright|spot|in|your|day|today|.|Some|days|you|have|to|look|really|hard|to|find|the|bright|spot|.|Keep|looking|!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715561894399705676/New-CaretakerDrug-Interactions	New Caretaker/Drug Interactions	I am beyond overwhelmed with my husband's recent Parkinson's diagnosis. I'm desperately trying to research it. My husband is just out of surgery for a non-related issue. The surgeon promised he would not let the nurses give him any meds that interact with Rasagiline (Azilect). Then the nurse wanted to give him Norco. I looked it up and found eight seemingly credible medical websites that said it's either not recommended or outright dangerous to combine these two. The nurse told me it wasn't dangerous and got another nurse to come in and say that none of the medical websites were accurate. You can't say that eight medical websites saying the same thing aren't accurate. Then they said it couldn't be dangerous because the pharmacist would never give something that would get them sued. I'm in the legal field and I can tell you that hospitals get sued all the time for this type of thing. I'm feeling very helpless. I'm already not trusting doctors since his neurologist put him on Rasagiline even when it can make you fall asleep when you are driving, when driving is my husband's job.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715561975248337903/Difficulty-understanding-my-husband	Difficulty understanding my husband	Thank you for writing with this important question. Speech problems are very common in people with Parkinson disease! It has been reported that as many as 89% of people with PD have trouble with their speech or voice. The most common difficulties include reduced vocal loudness, monotone, mumbled articulation and a hoarse or breathy sounding voice. Unfortunately, the medications that can be so helpful for improving limb movement don’t always have a positive effect for movement of speech muscles and increasing intelligibility. That is why people who have PD and communication difficulties need behavioral speech treatment. The experience of having difficulty finding the right words may also be common for people with Parkinson's disease particularly as the disease progresses. Both of these can have a negative impact on quality of life and I am glad that you wrote to learn more about it. The difficulties initiating speech and slower thinking are similar to difficulties in limb movements with delayed initiation and slowness of movement. Bradykinesia is the term typically used to describe this slowed initiation of movement. The underlying cause of some of speech and voice difficulties has multiple sources:. • Reduced vocal fold adduction. • Reduced mouth opening. • Decreased dynamic modulation of muscles of articulation. • Mismatch between the person’s perception of their loudness during communication and actual levels of loudness. Many times there is also a mismatch between the person’s perception of their loudness during communication and actual level of loudness and understandability just as the one you reported. For example, someone with PD may think people in their family need hearing aids when in fact it is the person with PD who is speaking too softly to be easily understood. No wonder you thought you needed a hearing aid. Unfortunately, the medications that can be so helpful for improving limb movement don’t always have a positive impact on bradykinesia for movement of speech muscles. That is why people who have communication difficulties as a result of PD need behavioral speech treatment. Research has shown that the homework component of treatment is critical for long-term success and carryover outside of the clinical environment. The good news is that speech treatment may help your husband. I recommend that you speak to your physician and get a referral to a speech-language pathologist (SLP). Find an SLP who is experienced in treating communication deficits associated with PD. That person will do an evaluation to determine how much of your difficulty is due to changes in speech motor control and how much may be caused by changes in cognitive/linguistic abilities. The significant memory changes that you described in your email are of concern so soon after diagnosis and is something that should e evaluated specifically. I hope this information helps and that you will seek an evaluation soon to get started on improving your communication skills. Please write again if you have any additional questions. 	1	1	Difficulty|understanding|my|husband	Thank|you|for|writing|with|this|important|question|.|Speech|problems|are|very|common|in|people|with|Parkinson|disease|!|It|has|been|reported|that|as|many|as|89|%|of|people|with|PD|have|trouble|with|their|speech|or|voice|.|The|most|common|difficulties|include|reduced|vocal|loudness|,|monotone|,|mumbled|articulation|and|a|hoarse|or|breathy|sounding|voice|.|Unfortunately|,|the|medications|that|can|be|so|helpful|for|improving|limb|movement|don|’|t|always|have|a|positive|effect|for|movement|of|speech|muscles|and|increasing|intelligibility|.|That|is|why|people|who|have|PD|and|communication|difficulties|need|behavioral|speech|treatment|.|The|experience|of|having|difficulty|finding|the|right|words|may|also|be|common|for|people|with|Parkinson's|disease|particularly|as|the|disease|progresses|.|Both|of|these|can|have|a|negative|impact|on|quality|of|life|and|I|am|glad|that|you|wrote|to|learn|more|about|it|.|The|difficulties|initiating|speech|and|slower|thinking|are|similar|to|difficulties|in|limb|movements|with|delayed|initiation|and|slowness|of|movement|.|Bradykinesia|is|the|term|typically|used|to|describe|this|slowed|initiation|of|movement|.|The|underlying|cause|of|some|of|speech|and|voice|difficulties|has|multiple|sources|:|.|•|Reduced|vocal|fold|adduction|.|•|Reduced|mouth|opening|.|•|Decreased|dynamic|modulation|of|muscles|of|articulation|.|•|Mismatch|between|the|person|’|s|perception|of|their|loudness|during|communication|and|actual|levels|of|loudness|.|Many|times|there|is|also|a|mismatch|between|the|person|’|s|perception|of|their|loudness|during|communication|and|actual|level|of|loudness|and|understandability|just|as|the|one|you|reported|.|For|example|,|someone|with|PD|may|think|people|in|their|family|need|hearing|aids|when|in|fact|it|is|the|person|with|PD|who|is|speaking|too|softly|to|be|easily|understood|.|No|wonder|you|thought|you|needed|a|hearing|aid|.|Unfortunately|,|the|medications|that|can|be|so|helpful|for|improving|limb|movement|don|’|t|always|have|a|positive|impact|on|bradykinesia|for|movement|of|speech|muscles|.|That|is|why|people|who|have|communication|difficulties|as|a|result|of|PD|need|behavioral|speech|treatment|.|Research|has|shown|that|the|homework|component|of|treatment|is|critical|for|long-term|success|and|carryover|outside|of|the|clinical|environment|.|The|good|news|is|that|speech|treatment|may|help|your|husband|.|I|recommend|that|you|speak|to|your|physician|and|get|a|referral|to|a|speech-language|pathologist|(|SLP|)|.|Find|an|SLP|who|is|experienced|in|treating|communication|deficits|associated|with|PD|.|That|person|will|do|an|evaluation|to|determine|how|much|of|your|difficulty|is|due|to|changes|in|speech|motor|control|and|how|much|may|be|caused|by|changes|in|cognitive|/|linguistic|abilities|.|The|significant|memory|changes|that|you|described|in|your|email|are|of|concern|so|soon|after|diagnosis|and|is|something|that|should|e|evaluated|specifically|.|I|hope|this|information|helps|and|that|you|will|seek|an|evaluation|soon|to|get|started|on|improving|your|communication|skills|.|Please|write|again|if|you|have|any|additional|questions|.

Now fast forward I think how simple PD care can be. One forum I came across explained how to find our proper dose and timing. It said to take one pill 25/100 and see if it works in 15 to 20 minutes. You might have to take a little more. Then see how long it lasts and then you have a good sense of what you need. I myself have added just 1/2 comtan which extends the interval depending on my exercise demand. That's about al for meds for me in almost two years. of self management. Having other interest helps a lot also. That idea of not paying attention to our symptoms pays off also.. Often I wake up with anxiety,to which I remind myself its not my thoughts but my imbalance caused by PD. I can either ignore my mind racing or take a 1/2 c/l.lol.

One of the potential side effects of DBS therapy is inducing a very positive mood state referred to as mania. These authors examined where DBS leads were located in patients that got ""manic"" and the majority were stimulated off of deep contacts in the substantia nigra region. If this side effect is encountered you should seek medical attention immediately either for reprogramming or for changes in medicine (mood stabilizers). Here is the abstract below:. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2010 Nov 3. [Epub ahead of print]. Contact dependent reproducible hypomania induced by deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease: clinical, anatomical and functional imaging study. Ulla M, Thobois S, Llorca PM, Derost P, Lemaire JJ, Chereau-Boudet I, de Chazeron I, Schmitt A, Ballanger B, Broussolle E, Durif F. CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Service de Neurologie A, Clermont-Ferrand, France. Hypomanic symptoms depending on anatomical location of contacts are reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, the underlying cortical and subcortical dysfunction is debated. In this study, five PD patients implanted with DBS-STN who presented with reversible and reproducible hypomanic symptoms after stimulation of specific 'manic' contacts were investigated. Hypomanic symptoms were assessed using the Bech and Rafaelsen Mania Scale (MAS). Three dimensional anatomical location of 'euthymic' and 'manic' contacts, after matching the postoperative CT scan with the preoperative stereotactic MRI, and a H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) study testing 'euthymic' and 'manic' contacts, were performed. Under 'euthymic' conditions, MAS score (mean±SD) was 0.6±0.5 compared with 7.8±3.1 under 'manic' conditions. Nine of 10 'manic' contacts were located in the substantia nigra, mainly in its ventral part. PET showed that hypomania was associated with strong asymmetrical cerebral activation involving preferentially the right hemisphere and was mediated by activation of the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex. The present study demonstrates the role of the subcortical structures in the genesis of hypomania in PD patients treated with DBS and stresses the involvement of the substantia nigra.

I begged and pleaded for two and a half years to no avail. My husband's unwillingness to get past his fears mean that he lives free of the encumbrances, both emotional and financial, of my PD, and I live in an adult family home. I question whether men are less likely to honor their marriage vows, specifically the main three: For better or for worse, for richer or poorer (have you noticed PD makes you poor quicker than say, diabetes?), in sickness and in health (discounting entirely the only other one, remaining faithful only to each other), until death parts us? According to Luthersfaith's theory that women are naturally better caregivers, does that mean we are more likely to be by our spouse's side through PD than he or any other man would be for their wives? What about all the male nurses now doing patient care? Are they more likely to stay with wives with PD because they are nurses and not because they are men? No, I don't think we can wholly blame this on inherent differences between men and women. There are those who are able to stand the pressure and those who are not. I've met men whose wives left them because they couldn't handle it and ""didn't sign on for it.""

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693737932913377476/Parkinson's-and-Dating	Parkinson's and Dating	I have been thinking about this topic for a few days. My story is much different. I have been married for over 20 years before being diagnosed. The marital commitment between my wife and myself has never been questioned. But to be a single person having PD and also being interested in a relationship, could be a quandary. I myself have no experience with it, But I know of a couple who fell in love after the woman became a Quadriplegic. It's a true love story. http://www.amazon.com/dp/0310314690/ref=as_li_ss_til? tag=dietofbookwor-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0310314690&amp;adid=0C9QHTBP1BQF43DP30Q1&amp;&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.challies.com%2Fbook-reviews%2Fjoni-ken-an-untold-love-story. 	1	1	Parkinson's|and|Dating	I|have|been|thinking|about|this|topic|for|a|few|days|.|My|story|is|much|different|.|I|have|been|married|for|over|20|years|before|being|diagnosed|.|The|marital|commitment|between|my|wife|and|myself|has|never|been|questioned|.|But|to|be|a|single|person|having|PD|and|also|being|interested|in|a|relationship|,|could|be|a|quandary|.|I|myself|have|no|experience|with|it|,|But|I|know|of|a|couple|who|fell|in|love|after|the|woman|became|a|Quadriplegic|.|It's|a|true|love|story|.|http://www.amazon.com/dp/0310314690/ref=as_li_ss_til|?|tag|=d|ietofbookwor|-|20|&|camp|=|213381|&|creative|=|390973|&|linkCode|=|as4|&|creativeASIN|=|03103146|90|&|adid|=|0C9QHTBP1BQF43DP30Q1|&|&|ref-refURL|=|http|%|3A|%|2F|%|2Fwww.challies.com|%|2Fbook|-|reviews|%|2Fjoni|-|ken-an-untold-love-story|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715561927847320070/No-Sleep-For-The-Weary	No Sleep For The Weary	I am reaching out to anyone who can please help. We are at our wits end. My 82 year old mother was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease about 5-6 years ago. She's been on Sinemet the whole time with increases here and there or changing her time to take. Mirapex was introduced probably at the beginning of 2016 because the Sinemet was not holding her over between doses. However, at some point at one of her visits, the Neuro doctor told her to take the Sinemet and Mirpaex together, 3 x's day. She has had so many falls, that I'm surprised that she's only broken her nose 4 times, front teeth, fractured T-12 that healed without physical therapy and she now has almost a solid 90 degree bend looking down and so many bruised and swollen knees that it's just a permanent symptom for her. For these past two years, she has also had a few hospital stays due to different things: UTI, flu/dehydration, intestinal issues. The Parkinson's Disease Dementia is blowing its way into her life now and is a constant part of her life instead of just crazy talk once in awhile. My reason for reaching out to you is to see if there is anyone out there who knows what can be taken for her not sleeping at night. Is there something out there that can truly help someone in the late stages of PD to fall asleep and stay asleep at night? She twitches and jerks so hard at night that she wakes herself up! Then of course, she needs to potty, then get back in bed, drift off to sleep, jerk herself awake, potty, back in bed, sleep, jerk, potty, bed, sleep, jerk, potty and on and on from 10:30pm (sometimes 10:00pm) - 5:00am (sometimes 6:00am), anywhere from 3 x's to 20 x's. Do you see my problem and it is a problem, not just an issue. Her general practitioner prescribed Xanax. Um, NO... then she's in a dope induced haze the next day. Also prescribed Ambien, that would be a double NO as she had hallucinations so bad she tried to eat a plastic bottle cap. We figured out the Sinemet needs to be taken no later than 6:00pm so it doesn't keep her awake. And after dinner which is between 6-7, she doesn't do a lot of drinking so the initial reason is not because she has a full bladder. I've read about everything I can get my hands on about this and everything that is going on is definitely PD related. So I know there must be someone out there who has or is going thru the same thing that has a suggestion or a medication that we could try to give her some peace and my brother, the primary caregiver a night's sleep so he can go to work his regular 9-5 M-F job. Any help and advice would be appreciated! 	1	1	No|Sleep|For|The|Weary	I|am|reaching|out|to|anyone|who|can|please|help|.|We|are|at|our|wits|end|.|My|82|year|old|mother|was|diagnosed|with|Parkinson's|Disease|about|5-6|years|ago|.|She's|been|on|Sinemet|the|whole|time|with|increases|here|and|there|or|changing|her|time|to|take|.|Mirapex|was|introduced|probably|at|the|beginning|of|2016|because|the|Sinemet|was|not|holding|her|over|between|doses|.|However|,|at|some|point|at|one|of|her|visits|,|the|Neuro|doctor|told|her|to|take|the|Sinemet|and|Mirpaex|together|,|3|x's|day|.|She|has|had|so|many|falls|,|that|I'm|surprised|that|she's|only|broken|her|nose|4|times|,|front|teeth|,|fractured|T|-|12|that|healed|without|physical|therapy|and|she|now|has|almost|a|solid|90|degree|bend|looking|down|and|so|many|bruised|and|swollen|knees|that|it's|just|a|permanent|symptom|for|her|.|For|these|past|two|years|,|she|has|also|had|a|few|hospital|stays|due|to|different|things|:|UTI|,|flu|/|dehydration|,|intestinal|issues|.|The|Parkinson's|Disease|Dementia|is|blowing|its|way|into|her|life|now|and|is|a|constant|part|of|her|life|instead|of|just|crazy|talk|once|in|awhile|.|My|reason|for|reaching|out|to|you|is|to|see|if|there|is|anyone|out|there|who|knows|what|can|be|taken|for|her|not|sleeping|at|night|.|Is|there|something|out|there|that|can|truly|help|someone|in|the|late|stages|of|PD|to|fall|asleep|and|stay|asleep|at|night|?|She|twitches|and|jerks|so|hard|at|night|that|she|wakes|herself|up|!|Then|of|course|,|she|needs|to|potty|,|then|get|back|in|bed|,|drift|off|to|sleep|,|jerk|herself|awake|,|potty|,|back|in|bed|,|sleep|,|jerk|,|potty|,|bed|,|sleep|,|jerk|,|potty|and|on|and|on|from|10:30|pm|(|sometimes|10:00|pm|)|-|5:00|am|(|sometimes|6:00|am|)|,|anywhere|from|3|x's|to|20|x's|.|Do|you|see|my|problem|and|it|is|a|problem|,|not|just|an|issue|.|Her|general|practitioner|prescribed|Xanax|.|Um|,|NO|...|then|she's|in|a|dope|induced|haze|the|next|day|.|Also|prescribed|Ambien|,|that|would|be|a|double|NO|as|she|had|hallucinations|so|bad|she|tried|to|eat|a|plastic|bottle|cap|.|We|figured|out|the|Sinemet|needs|to|be|taken|no|later|than|6:00|pm|so|it|doesn't|keep|her|awake|.|And|after|dinner|which|is|between|6-7|,|she|doesn't|do|a|lot|of|drinking|so|the|initial|reason|is|not|because|she|has|a|full|bladder|.|I've|read|about|everything|I|can|get|my|hands|on|about|this|and|everything|that|is|going|on|is|definitely|PD|related|.|So|I|know|there|must|be|someone|out|there|who|has|or|is|going|thru|the|same|thing|that|has|a|suggestion|or|a|medication|that|we|could|try|to|give|her|some|peace|and|my|brother|,|the|primary|caregiver|a|night's|sleep|so|he|can|go|to|work|his|regular|9-5|M-F|job|.|Any|help|and|advice|would|be|appreciated|!
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693740547476930926/depressed-PWP	depressed PWP	"I personally have been on antidepressants for years. I firmly believe that half the population should be on antidepressants. The other half NEEDS to be on them. Depression is a common symptom with PD patients. Whether it is due directly from the Parkinson's or if it is just the monumental struggle that comes from dealing with Parkinson's, it really doesn't matter. It's THERE. DH's neuro gave him an Rx for an antidepressant rather early in the game, but I think it was due to the fact that the diagnosis of PD came just two years after he was diagnosed with seizure disorder, and THAT had a significant impact on his life. I think antidepressants need a different name. Too many people don't want to even think about taking them, because they feel they would be labeled with the stigma of depression, and the common belief is depression is a weakness. If you are a strong person, you should be able to ""snap out of it."" And to be truly ""depressed,"" you would be crawling into a nearby corner and crying your eyes out. I've lectured many family and friends that this category of drugs is truly a neurotransmitter. If you have difficulties in your life, it often disrupts the chemical soup in your brain, and your brain cannot function efficiently. All this medication does is bring balance back to that chemical soup. If a certain antidepressant doesn't seem to be working, talk to your doctor. There are a zillion antidepressants available today, and perhaps another one would be effective. It takes at least two and a half weeks for it to kick in... and when it does, the effect is astounding! ~VOW.

I hope by some miracle that you do not have PD. If you do try not to worry too much time will be the tell all. It took me going to the right doctor who called in three other neurologist, and the better part of the day, going over previous testing, and doing exams, before I received the preliminary diagnosis, reached by the team. The first pill the following morning confirmed the diagnosis for me. I was scheduled with a MDS, who confirmed the diagnosis three months later.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693738535491821789/Activity	Activity	"I'm new to this forum, and I""m looking for some ideas of activities that I can maybe do with my uncle. He is in his 60's and parkinsons has taken his eye sight, speech, and recently due to an infection he had to have his leg amputated. The loss of vision, and speech came on rather quickly. And now with the recent loss of his leg, I'm afraid he is not in the best of spirits. I visit him on my work lunch hour, and wish there was something that I could do, but I just don't know what. I usually just sit and talk to him about my day, and my family. Does anyone have any suggestions? Reading out loud? Or ideas for easy ways to communicate? His hands are usually clenched tight most of the time. He is not able to write with them. He can get some words across, but it is labored, and often times just a whisper that is hard to understand. Also, the speech therapist is working on his swallowing. After his leg surgery for serveral reasons he was unable to eat, and in just that short time his swallowing muscles weakened.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693738746785308223/onset-symptoms?	onset symptoms?	Greetings, ND... My first piece of advice is to slow down and take a breath! I know you are anxious. Knowing that something is not right in your body, and not knowing what that is, can be nerve-wracking. No one here can really diagnose you...so, I'm glad you have a neurological appointment scheduled. I have had Parkinson's for nine years (33 at diagnosis). My initial symptom was poor fine motor control in my fingers. While tremors are a common indicator of Parkinson's, they are more common in later onset as opposed to early onset (diagnosis before 50). To date, I still do not experience tremors. PD tremors usually begin on one side and, with time, move to the other side. They are also resting tremors, meaning they appear when at rest and go away upon movement. What you are experiencing could be due to many things...from anxiety to PD to whatever... Your best bet is to gather all of your symptom information and share all of that with the neurologist. With PD, there is no definitive dianostic test. The diagnosis is made after rule-out of other conditions via various tests. So, be prepared that you will likely not get an answer on the day of your appointment. I know it's hard not to worry (especially at 28)...but try to relax and proceed logically. It is my prayer that you'll find the answer... If you'd like to talk by phone, e-mail me and I'll get contact information to you. Peace and blessings,. Mihai (Michael). 	1	1	onset|symptoms|?

Use ""Parkinson's support group"" as a search term to find local chapters of various kinds, one or more of which may be close to you or close to what you're looking for. I don't have a lot of advice because I'm relatively new to the disease but a theme that resonates with me is the more exercise, healthy diet, and in-depth research I can do about the disease the more I will forestall intensification of symptoms. There are some interesting exercise programs showing results (slowing progression) available as illustrative YouTube videos. One shows that a test in which the non-Parkinson's partner rode a tandem bicycle with the Parkinson's partner the NPP was able to drive the pace and distance farther than would otherwise have occurred. Likewise, there is some research in something called ""Rock Steady Boxing"" in which noncontact sparring for exercise is showing some positive results. Group exercises and classes will tend to escalate your participation in your own care. If your introversion or possibly lack of results from joining an exercise support group get in the way of your future exercise then start your own support group that is more to your liking. In my community there are exercise groups of every kind one can think of, and many of them have overcome the shyness and introversion of new members. It's not clear what your health insurance options are. Lucky for me, I am Medicare eligible and have expensive but broad-based secondary coverage. So far that means I'm able to see a physical therapist once a week for a 45 minute-one hour appointment. It is right next to the gym where I regularly work out. The PT has been gradually increasing the amount of exercise with which I am being challenged. I also volunteered for a research study on cognition effects that included a free MRI brain scan, which I view as establishing my personal baseline for some future point when I may need (or be evaluated for) deep brain stimulation. Whether the MRI or cognition test show anything at all is still open-ended, but it helps to keep engaged with what's going on especially if you have a research center like the NIH close by. The original post was about how to get motivated to exercise. I think the hardest part is considering (and making the decision) that daily serious exercise will be the new lifestyle (I call mine Parkinson's+).. And what is so totally awesome is that my partner/caretaker joins in and motivates me mightily with her expectations that it's not a chore, but rather a lifestyle. Hope this helps.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693738423043912820/Cerebrospinal-fluid-concentrations-of-N-acetylcysteine-after-oral-administration-in-Parkinson's-disease.	Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of N-acetylcysteine after oral administration in Parkinson's disease.	This is a very small study, and not conclusive. Nonetheless, it is encouraging research, as previously it has been thought that glutathione could not be produced in the brain by those with PD. The fact that N-acetylcysteine is present in spinal fluid after being taken orally seems to indicate that it does cross the blood-brain barrier. If that is the case, then potentially it may be found to produce glutathione in the brain. In the interview shown below the journal abstract, one of the authors describes the study further. The authors indicate, however, that the study results are still under scrutiny, and that individuals should not begin using NAC outside of clinical trials at this time (see bolded text). -Kathrynne. Parkinsonism Relat Disord. 2015 May;21(5):500-3. doi: 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2015.02.020. Epub 2015 Feb 28. Katz M1, Won SJ2, Park Y3, Orr A2, Jones DP3, Swanson RA2, Glass GA2. Author information. Abstract INTRODUCTION:Depletion of neuronal glutathione may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can restore neuronal glutathione levels, but it has not been established whether NAC can cross the blood-brain barrier in humans. METHODS:Twelve patients with PD were given oral NAC twice daily for 2 days. Three doses were compared: 7 mg/kg, 35 mg/kg, and 70 mg/kg. NAC, cysteine, and glutathione were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at baseline and 90 min after the last dose. Cognitive and motor functions were assessed pre- and post-NAC administration using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III motor subscore (UPDRS-III). RESULTS:Oral NAC produced a dose-dependent increase in CSF NAC concentrations (p &lt; 0.001), with the highest dose producing a CSF concentration of 9.26 ± 1.62 μM. There were no significant adverse events. NAC had no acute effect on motor or cognitive function. CONCLUSION:Orally administered NAC produces biologically relevant CSF NAC concentrations at doses that are well tolerated. The findings support the feasibility of NAC as a potential disease-modifying therapy for PD. Published by Elsevier Ltd. =======.

Maya Katz: I obtained my undergraduate and medical degree at Cornell University, and completed my residency in Neurology at Mount Sinai Medical Center, where I was chief resident. I then completed a Movement Disorders Fellowship at UCSF Medical Center. I have been fortunate to be able to stay at UCSF as a junior faculty member in the Department of Neurology. I also have the privilege of helping to care for our nation’s veterans through a joint appointment at the San Francisco VA Parkinson’s Disease Research Education and Clinical Center (PADRECC).KH: What got you interested in studying the role of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in Parkinson’s disease (PD)?MK: Ultimately, seeing my patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) progress, and being unable to stop the development of disability from PD with current therapies inspired me to pursue disease modifying treatments. There is a known association between glutathione depletion and neurodegeneration in PD. NAC is an exciting compound to study as a potential neuroprotective therapy because there is robust evidence of NAC being able to replete glutathione and reduce neuronal loss in multiple animal models of PD. NAC is also readily available, inexpensive, and already FDA approved for short-term and long-term indications. A preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic trial in PD patients was the logical next step to help move our understanding of this potential neuroprotective treatment forward. KH: What is the biochemistry of NAC that might alter the pathophysiology of PD? MK: We know that glutathione is a vital antioxidant that is necessary for neuronal survival. We also know that glutathione is depleted in PD, and that this likely contributes to neuronal loss. NAC has the capacity to replete glutathione, and is therefore, a potential disease modifying therapy in PD. KH: Where did you come up with the doses of 7 mg/kg, 35 mg/kg, and 70 mg/kg given twice daily (or were those the total daily doses)? How were they taken? With meals or away from meals? In a single dose or divided dose? MK: The doses were taken twice daily in either 1) liquid form (20% solution, USP verified), or 2) capsule form (compounded by the UCSF pharmacy using USP verified NAC in powder form). The liquid form is currently commercially available, and has a rather noxious smell and taste. As a result, the capsule form was better tolerated. The majority of the patients took the medication with food, and we did not require fasting prior to ingestion because we wanted to ascertain if adequate CSF levels could be attained without this restriction. We used a systematic approach to identify the doses used in our study. The first step was to identify the NAC dose at which biological effects could be demonstrated in a rodent model. The CSF concentration ofNAC at this oral dose was then determined. This then led us to investigate what oral dose was required to achieve this concentration in the CSF of human PD patients. The initial dose of 7 mg/kg used in the study correlated well with the 600 mg twice daily dose already approved for use by the FDA as a mucolytic and for contrast-induced nephropathy. This low dose did not yield adequate CSF levels, prompting us to study higher doses. The largest chronic dosing study of NAC in normal controls showed that 11.2g/day used over 6 to 9 months was safe and well-tolerated. This dose correlated well with the maximum dose administered in our study (70 mg/kg) and was within the FDA guidelines for use of this agent. We then looked at 50% ofthat dose (35 mg/kg) to further understand the pharmacokinetics of this compound, and to see if lower doses yielded adequate CSF levels over 2 days. KH: Were blood and/or CFS levels of NAC or other biochemical markers taken before, during or after the intervention? If so did they correlate with symptoms and supplementation with NAC? MK: CSF levels were taken prior to and after the intervention, and revealed that NAC readily crosses the blood-brain-barrier to achieve biologically relevant CSF NAC concentrations. KH: Can you tell us about your study and the basic results? MK: Our study showed that orally administered NAC is well tolerated and produces a dose-dependent increase in CSF NAC, indicating that this compound readily crosses the blood-brain-barrier, and that it achieves levels in the central nervous system that are more than 40-fold greater than the concentrations shown to have biological effects in a rodent model, making it a potential disease-modifying therapy in PD. KH: Were there any side effects with the NAC therapy? How was the patient compliance? MK: This study had 100% patient compliance. There were mild transient adverse effects in two subjects, both at the 70 mg/kg dose (one subject with mild nausea, and one with mild diarrhea).There were no dropouts from the study due to side effects from NAC. KH: Who is a candidate for NAC therapy? All subjects with PD? Only those with low CFS or serum levels of NAC? If so how would you estimate the dose? MK: Currently, PD patients should not take NAC outside of clinical trials because its efficacy and optimal dosing are still being investigated. In addition, NAC available over-the-counter (OTC) is not regulated by the FDA, and is therefore of variable purity and should not be taken for medical purposes. If NAC is shown to significantly delay PD progression in future blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, then potentially all patients with PD would be candidates for NAC, prescribed in a FDA-regulated capsule form. Baseline NAC levels in the CSF are zero, so this would not be a useful way to determine patient eligibility. The dose of NAC is likely to be based on findings from our pharmacokinetic study, and from further studies in larger numbers of patients confirming safety, tolerability and efficacy. KH: How can the public or health professionals use this information? MK: People with Parkinson’s disease should be hopeful that there are several potential disease modifying therapies being studied, and that there is a tremendous amount of scientific effort being expended to try to find a way to delay PD progression. The public needs to be conservative in their interpretation of our preliminary study. We have shown that NAC is well tolerated and safe in only a small number of PD patients, taking NAC for a short amount of time. Further larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. KH: Do you have any further comments on this very interesting subject? MK: We are currently planning a Phase II trial to further determine the safety and tolerability of NAC in PD patients, as well as further investigate optimal dosing strategies. 	1	1	Cerebrospinal|fluid|concentrations|of|N-acetylcysteine|after|oral|administration|in|Parkinson's|disease|.

Do you have any trouble with MCI with your PD? I know I do. I cannot even remember what my wife fixed for me last night. I know that sounds crazy, but I can only remember what I ate today. In a sense, I am glad I was diagnosed with PD, because I believe God had something better for me than I could possibly imagine. I mean, it's not going to be one of those scenarios like for instance Michael J. Fox, were I start my own foundation for a cure. In some form of fashion we are all activists' who happened to be diagnosed with PD. The terms on and off mean a whole lot to some people. Like for instance, Saturday, my family and I went to Walmart, the people that work the self check out. The lady said to me was, how are you today? At this point, it was about time when I normally take my dosage of Requip. I just happen to say, ""Not good ma'am, I am coming ""off"". That lady didn't understand what I was talking about, but my wife knew, because I always carry my PD meds when I go somewhere. That lady looked at my wife and said, ""What's wrong with him"". My wife replied, ""My husband has Parkinson's Disease"". My wife looked at me and said, ""The medicine is in my purse. Do you need to go to the car"".

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693737566928975002/tai-chi	tai chi	Tai Chi for Parkinson's blog..... It’s Friday morning and I meet my fellow Tai Chi practitioners in the park. As we stand silently among the budding rose bushes and almond trees, I struggle to empty my mind. I feel nervous. Will I be able to get through the form? Will the others notice my trembling hands? Will I lose my balance while doing the kicks? My Tai Chi instructor, Arieh Breslow, slowly takes a deep breath, exhales and sinks into his right leg. We all begin to follow as he starts the form. I take a deep breath of the cool Jerusalem air and exhale as I sink, telling myself to relax, relax. As I progress through the form, I begin to gain confidence in my body. Breathing deeply, sinking, flowing, relaxing, releasing tension, I realize that I can still do this. I feel good. I feel wonderful. Starting the form was not always filled with such trepidation. There was a time when I felt completely confident. But, Parkinson’s disease has changed that. I had my first symptoms of Parkinson’s at the age of 49. My left shoulder wasn’t moving easily during warm-up exercises and my left hand wasn’t always in the correct position when doing the Tai Chi form. At first, I shrugged it off as stiffness. A year later I developed a small tremor in my left hand and my arm didn’t swing properly when I walked. It was then that I decided to see a neurologist - I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. I knew that if I wanted to maintain a high quality of life, I would need to develop a program for coping with this disease. My doctor prescribed a cocktail of medications for reducing my symptoms, with a myriad of side effects. This prompted me to investigate alternative approaches that would allow me to function as normally as possible. My medical journey led me into Chinese herbal medicine and Ayurvedic treatments from a doctor in India, pressure-point massage and acupuncture from a Tibetan monk, and Yoga lessons. Although these treatments gave me some relief, I felt that none of them could match the combination of proper medication and Tai Chi. Today, my personal program is based on three pillars: medication, exercise (with Tai Chi as the basis), and a low-fat vegetarian diet high in antioxidants to protect and boost my remaining brain cells. The program is by no means static - I constantly adjust it to my changing medical condition. Over time, I’ve noticed the accumulative effects of my health regimen. A good Tai Chi workout seems to be as effective for me as taking a pill and the results of a session last for hours. Tai Chi is an internal martial art form that uses the mind to control the movements of the body. It helps you become aware of your body and the integration of each part with the whole. Visual imagery is used to help in this mind–body connection and to aid in movement and coordination. The slow, deliberate movements of the Tai Chi form can directly address many of the major Parkinson's symptoms. For example: &lt;&gt;·Preventing falls and developing flexibility - The constant sinking, turning, and shifting of weight in the Tai Chi form gives a tremendous workout to the legs and lower body. The constant transition from move to move stretches the hip and groin area strengthening the muscles and joints. Each stance ends with roots sunk deep into the ground, while remaining flexible like a tree in the wind.&lt;&gt;·Balance - In Tai Chi, proper alignment of the body is obtained by tucking in the chin, raising the back of the neck slightly, and elongating the spine as if it is suspended from the top of the head like a string of pearls. This “string” imagery relieves the stress on the back muscles, relaxes the shoulders and improves posture and balance.&lt;&gt;·Rigidity and freezing - It is not unusual for Parkinson’s people to experience rigidity or to suddenly become frozen when walking. Concentrating on flowing like a river in the form produces beautiful even movements that are thrilling to experience. Through Tai Chi, I get a sense of accomplishment and well being, knowing that I can still function relatively well and, in some cases better, than a person with no physical limitations.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693759818629513505/New-Study:-ECT-to-Treat-Depression-in-Parkinson's	New Study: ECT to Treat Depression in Parkinson's	Dear doctors,. My father had shock treatment twice and it worked wonderfully. His doctor tried all the medicines available to mankind and it did absolutely nothing. The shock treatments worked as well as Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead. I would try it first instead of last for depression. Unfortunately, doctors are bound to a certain code, whereby they have to try every medicine before they try shock therapy. It does no harm if done right, the only side effect was short term memory loss. But I am afraid that so many doctos are ignorant about the effectiveness of the treatment that many patients are not well served. The second time my father had the treatment, I had told the phsychiatrist at the nursing home that my father had shock therapy 3 years prior. He said he knew and that my father had said it did not work. I told him he had to be kidding. You don't ask a patient if the treatment worked because if it did they don't remember how bad they were before the treatment. Unbelieveable! Right now my father is in the hospital with pnuemonia after having a fecal impaction a month ago. He got both in my opinion because his doctor and my mom and siblings refused to give him shock therapy again, which in my opinion, should have been done a couple years ago. 	1	1	New|Study|:|ECT|to|Treat|Depression|in|Parkinson's	Dear|doctors|,|.|My|father|had|shock|treatment|twice|and|it|worked|wonderfully|.|His|doctor|tried|all|the|medicines|available|to|mankind|and|it|did|absolutely|nothing|.|The|shock|treatments|worked|as|well|as|Jesus|raising|Lazarus|from|the|dead|.|I|would|try|it|first|instead|of|last|for|depression|.|Unfortunately|,|doctors|are|bound|to|a|certain|code|,|whereby|they|have|to|try|every|medicine|before|they|try|shock|therapy|.|It|does|no|harm|if|done|right|,|the|only|side|effect|was|short|term|memory|loss|.|But|I|am|afraid|that|so|many|doctos|are|ignorant|about|the|effectiveness|of|the|treatment|that|many|patients|are|not|well|served|.|The|second|time|my|father|had|the|treatment|,|I|had|told|the|phsychiatrist|at|the|nursing|home|that|my|father|had|shock|therapy|3|years|prior|.|He|said|he|knew|and|that|my|father|had|said|it|did|not|work|.|I|told|him|he|had|to|be|kidding|.|You|don't|ask|a|patient|if|the|treatment|worked|because|if|it|did|they|don't|remember|how|bad|they|were|before|the|treatment|.|Unbelieveable|!|Right|now|my|father|is|in|the|hospital|with|pnuemonia|after|having|a|fecal|impaction|a|month|ago|.|He|got|both|in|my|opinion|because|his|doctor|and|my|mom|and|siblings|refused|to|give|him|shock|therapy|again|,|which|in|my|opinion|,|should|have|been|done|a|couple|years|ago|.

I did RSVP for one of their talks that is local to me though, let's see. Interesting. I will have to look and see if specific types have different effects. Intuitively, anaerobic and weight based training seems like it would lead to more BDNF-1 type growth factors, but I'd be curious as to see the specific data. Interesting clinical trials. I also came across the Michael J Fox link for therapies in development which has been great as well:. https://www.michaeljfox.org/understanding-parkinsons/living-with-pd/topic.php? therapies-in-development-disease-modify. It seems that MCC 9050 is still so early in development that they haven't even listed it as a potential agent yet. Inosine and urate levels are an interesting complex. I tried finding out about SURE-PD3, but the NIH still lists the study as active for some reason (https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT02642393). That's is disappointing to hear though. Our own neurologist said the same thing, fairly lukewarm reviews on Azilect. Her naturopath seemed to be a huge fan of the medication though. I had her taking Emsam which is transdermal selegiline to reduce potential MAO effects in the gut (though these are supposedly theoretical and overhyped, I wanted to be cautious). Her neurologist disagreed, changed her back to the pill form, and she started having episodes of severe fatigue, dizziness sweating so he took her off. I do believe since discontinuing the medication there has been some worsening of her tremor, though I am not sure. I think I will be starting her on the patch again shortly. That's a great resource, thank you. In particular I found their 'top posts' link to be fascinating: https://scienceofparkinsons.com/top-posts/. 	1	1	Parkinson's|:|therapies|for|'|disease|modification|'|instead|of|'|symptom|masking|'|-|a|physician's|perspective	Thank|you|,|it|does|seem|to|be|fairly|early|in|its|development|.|I|did|RSVP|for|one|of|their|talks|that|is|local|to|me|though|,|let's|see|.|Interesting|.|I|will|have|to|look|and|see|if|specific|types|have|different|effects|.|Intuitively|,|anaerobic|and|weight|based|training|seems|like|it|would|lead|to|more|BDNF|-|1|type|growth|factors|,|but|I'd|be|curious|as|to|see|the|specific|data|.|Interesting|clinical|trials|.|I|also|came|across|the|Michael|J|Fox|link|for|therapies|in|development|which|has|been|great|as|well|:|.|https://www.michaeljfox.org/understanding-parkinsons/living-with-pd/topic.php|?|therapies-in-development-disease-modify|.|It|seems|that|MCC|9050|is|still|so|early|in|development|that|they|haven't|even|listed|it|as|a|potential|agent|yet|.|Inosine|and|urate|levels|are|an|interesting|complex|.|I|tried|finding|out|about|SURE-PD|3|,|but|the|NIH|still|lists|the|study|as|active|for|some|reason|(|https://clinicaltrials|.|gov|/|ct2|/|show|/|NCT|02642393|)|.|That's|is|disappointing|to|hear|though|.|Our|own|neurologist|said|the|same|thing|,|fairly|lukewarm|reviews|on|Azilect|.|Her|naturopath|seemed|to|be|a|huge|fan|of|the|medication|though|.|I|had|her|taking|Emsam|which|is|transdermal|selegiline|to|reduce|potential|MAO|effects|in|the|gut|(|though|these|are|supposedly|theoretical|and|overhyped|,|I|wanted|to|be|cautious|)|.|Her|neurologist|disagreed|,|changed|her|back|to|the|pill|form|,|and|she|started|having|episodes|of|severe|fatigue|,|dizziness|sweating|so|he|took|her|off|.|I|do|believe|since|discontinuing|the|medication|there|has|been|some|worsening|of|her|tremor|,|though|I|am|not|sure|.|I|think|I|will|be|starting|her|on|the|patch|again|shortly|.|That's|a|great|resource|,|thank|you|.|In|particular|I|found|their|'|top|posts|'|link|to|be|fascinating|:|https://scienceofparkinsons.com/top-posts/|.

It entailed a lot of walking about and of course handling meals on plates, it was quite funny at meal times serving meals when my hand started to shake, the food nearly ended up on the floor, but the staff were very good and understood and helped!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693918670001899414/Going-it-alone	Going it alone	Hi Tabbycat, I had been taking Ropinirole for about 2yrs., gradually increasing the dose by 2mg., until I was on 12mg. It made me feel slightly light headed and not quite 'with it'. Each time I increased the dose, I expected things to improve, which they didn't. The Ropinirole also played havoc with my eyesight, causing my prescription to change every 3 months, (expensive when you're paying out £250 a time, for new lenses)!!! I continued taking Selegiline, but since reducing the Ropinirole and coming off it altogether, I feel more like my old self again. My Parkinson's is very mild anyway...... I don't have dystonia or dyskinesia, just bradykinesia, a slow right arm and some clumsiness. That's the trouble with all these meds., we all react differently to them And yes, I am going to begin taking half a Maucuna tablet, a day and see how I feel.

I'll look him up in a bit and try to contact him. Most kind of you. Like you, HughsNewbie, I've been taking Macuna Pruriens for just over a month. At first I thought it was working, but now, not so sure. Seem to have goodish days and bad days, but never much energy and my walking gets poorer. I'm taking 2 capsules twice a day. I got these capsules from a reputable supplier in India....came with proper documentation and stamp of approval by standards board. I emailed the manufacturers to ask when and how many capsules I should take for Parkinson's. They suggested 2 capsules, after food taken with milk. Up until then, all the info I'd read, said to take them half an hour before food, with a cup of green tea. So, I've tried both methods, but can't say I've noticed much difference. As you say, don't really know what dosage we need. Still experimenting though, as my head feels a lot clearer than when I was on conventional meds. Will try to find out more from this Andrew J.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693918672938607586/Understanding-my-Dad's-behavior	Understanding my Dad's behavior	Hi Jodie, I'm really sorry to hear your story. I have direct experience of dopamine agonists and the effects they can have on some people. For a while I was on quite a high dose and I was utterly unaware of the devastating effects these drugs can have. Behaviour and attitude changes crept up on me and for a while I was quite out of control. When I reduced and then stopped taking the dopamine agonist drug my thinking changed so starkly I was amazed. My experience wasn't quite as extreme as your Dad's but I recognise all the traits in your story. Feeling compelled to do something even though you 'know' you don't want to do is very scary. If you can get him off dopamine agonists (with the support of your PD Nurse) you may well find you get your old Dad back. Parkinson's is a complex condition. It can be very hard on the PWP and everyone around them. I hope you can take some comfort from the fact that there are people here who have been through what you are now facing and have survived.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693918658661964233/Positive-Thinking	Positive Thinking	Hi Lexi, What medication are you starting on? Sorry to hear that you had no advice, I was actually given a lot of information when I started taking stuff (don't think I took any of it in beyond the word 'Parkinson's' but at least they tried). Being positive is a great aim but it shouldn't be a pressure; it's ok to feel how you do, just chip away at it. I have days, even weeks and weeks, when I'm doing ok and then I can hit the floor again. I got completely stumped Xmas shopping tonight because I was rushing so then I couldn't get my purse out of my bag, and I couldn't get my card out of my purse and I got embarrassed so it all got worse. Sometimes I can laugh it off, sometimes not so much. Be kind to yourself and, as you wisely say, one day at a time. Take care, J. 	1	1	Positive|Thinking	Hi|Lexi|,|What|medication|are|you|starting|on|?|Sorry|to|hear|that|you|had|no|advice|,|I|was|actually|given|a|lot|of|information|when|I|started|taking|stuff|(|don't|think|I|took|any|of|it|in|beyond|the|word|'|Parkinson's|'|but|at|least|they|tried|)|.|Being|positive|is|a|great|aim|but|it|shouldn't|be|a|pressure|;|it's|ok|to|feel|how|you|do|,|just|chip|away|at|it|.|I|have|days|,|even|weeks|and|weeks|,|when|I'm|doing|ok|and|then|I|can|hit|the|floor|again|.|I|got|completely|stumped|Xmas|shopping|tonight|because|I|was|rushing|so|then|I|couldn't|get|my|purse|out|of|my|bag|,|and|I|couldn't|get|my|card|out|of|my|purse|and|I|got|embarrassed|so|it|all|got|worse|.|Sometimes|I|can|laugh|it|off|,|sometimes|not|so|much|.|Be|kind|to|yourself|and|,|as|you|wisely|say|,|one|day|at|a|time|.|Take|care|,|J|.

Sometimes I’m fine but sometimes I get slushy and vague and it tends to make me just fall asleep. I’m embarrassed to admit I can cope with these symptoms ( most things in life are a trade off :-S) but it does nothing for my mood in the short or long term so it’s had to go. Worryingly, I think not drinking is having as big an impact on my social life as the Parkinson’s itself! Nowadays, I’m slightly slow, slightly shaky, slightly slurry, slightly embarrassing and very sober. The slightly merry version was apparently more acceptable so the absence of wine appears to be quite a factor in the ever decreasing invites to all things social. :-/ Jx. 	1	1	In|effect|of|alcohol|on|Parkinsons|drugs	Have|also|pretty|much|ditched|wine|.|Sometimes|I|’|m|fine|but|sometimes|I|get|slushy|and|vague|and|it|tends|to|make|me|just|fall|asleep|.|I|’|m|embarrassed|to|admit|I|can|cope|with|these|symptoms|(|most|things|in|life|are|a|trade|off|:|-|S|)|but|it|does|nothing|for|my|mood|in|the|short|or|long|term|so|it|’|s|had|to|go|.|Worryingly|,|I|think|not|drinking|is|having|as|big|an|impact|on|my|social|life|as|the|Parkinson|’|s|itself|!|Nowadays|,|I|’|m|slightly|slow|,|slightly|shaky|,|slightly|slurry|,|slightly|embarrassing|and|very|sober|.|The|slightly|merry|version|was|apparently|more|acceptable|so|the|absence|of|wine|appears|to|be|quite|a|factor|in|the|ever|decreasing|invites|to|all|things|social|.|:-/|Jx|.

I looked into it some time ago after OH diagnosed with Parkinson's for almost 20 years at age 47 and felt that they did not meet the criteria. They worked for many years in a very demanding job until they could no longer do this and then, for a few years I went back to work full time. PUK are currently undertaking a campaign regarding PIP. I have said this before on another thread and donned my tin hat:some are applying for PIP far too soon after diagnosis and therefore jeopardising others. You may not like what I have said, and being mindful that PWP symptoms all progress at different rates, BUT, most PWP do not require PIP after a few years after diagnosis. Recently, after being diagnosed with Parkinson's dementia, that was recognised as a criteria for an award of PIP. I hope you are never in the same situation in the future. 	1	1	Entitlement|to|any|form|of|financial|support	PIP|is|not|a|means|tested|benefit|,|BUT|,|you|do|have|to|meet|the|criteria|that|they|set|.|I|looked|into|it|some|time|ago|after|OH|diagnosed|with|Parkinson's|for|almost|20|years|at|age|47|and|felt|that|they|did|not|meet|the|criteria|.|They|worked|for|many|years|in|a|very|demanding|job|until|they|could|no|longer|do|this|and|then|,|for|a|few|years|I|went|back|to|work|full|time|.|PUK|are|currently|undertaking|a|campaign|regarding|PIP|.|I|have|said|this|before|on|another|thread|and|donned|my|tin|hat|:|some|are|applying|for|PIP|far|too|soon|after|diagnosis|and|therefore|jeopardising|others|.|You|may|not|like|what|I|have|said|,|and|being|mindful|that|PWP|symptoms|all|progress|at|different|rates|,|BUT|,|most|PWP|do|not|require|PIP|after|a|few|years|after|diagnosis|.|Recently|,|after|being|diagnosed|with|Parkinson's|dementia|,|that|was|recognised|as|a|criteria|for|an|award|of|PIP|.|I|hope|you|are|never|in|the|same|situation|in|the|future|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715785469656143077/critical-illness-claim	critical illness claim	No. I could not get paid. My case is complicated I was diagnosed with Parkinson Disease in 2014 and I had put my first claim for group critical illness to insurance company in early March 2015. Insurance company sent me a reply in July 2015 stating that they could not pay a claim because my condition had not satisfied the definition of Parkinson Disease because my medical reports did not report me as having a tremor or postural instability. The letter also stated that I should remain a member of the scheme and should my condition deteriorate to the required severity after April 1st 2016, then they would be happy to reconsider a further claim. But I had already deselected the group critical illness cover from my company benefits list on March 2015 as my claim was already made to insurance company and the policy document also stated that any pre-existing medical conditions or associated conditions are not covered. After receiving this letter, I did try my best to re-enroll into the scheme but the company could not open the window for selecting the group critical illness benefit until the following year, March 2016, and I immediately re-selected the scheme once available. Inevitably, my condition deteriorated to the required severity, so I requested a second claim against group critical illness in August 2017. But insurer did not agree to pay the claim this time either stating I was not a member of the scheme between April 2015 and March 2016. 	1	1	critical|illness|claim	No|.|I|could|not|get|paid|.|My|case|is|complicated|I|was|diagnosed|with|Parkinson|Disease|in|2014|and|I|had|put|my|first|claim|for|group|critical|illness|to|insurance|company|in|early|March|2015|.|Insurance|company|sent|me|a|reply|in|July|2015|stating|that|they|could|not|pay|a|claim|because|my|condition|had|not|satisfied|the|definition|of|Parkinson|Disease|because|my|medical|reports|did|not|report|me|as|having|a|tremor|or|postural|instability|.|The|letter|also|stated|that|I|should|remain|a|member|of|the|scheme|and|should|my|condition|deteriorate|to|the|required|severity|after|April|1st|2016|,|then|they|would|be|happy|to|reconsider|a|further|claim|.|But|I|had|already|deselected|the|group|critical|illness|cover|from|my|company|benefits|list|on|March|2015|as|my|claim|was|already|made|to|insurance|company|and|the|policy|document|also|stated|that|any|pre-existing|medical|conditions|or|associated|conditions|are|not|covered|.|After|receiving|this|letter|,|I|did|try|my|best|to|re-enroll|into|the|scheme|but|the|company|could|not|open|the|window|for|selecting|the|group|critical|illness|benefit|until|the|following|year|,|March|2016|,|and|I|immediately|re-selected|the|scheme|once|available|.|Inevitably|,|my|condition|deteriorated|to|the|required|severity|,|so|I|requested|a|second|claim|against|group|critical|illness|in|August|2017|.|But|insurer|did|not|agree|to|pay|the|claim|this|time|either|stating|I|was|not|a|member|of|the|scheme|between|April|2015|and|March|2016|.

Consultant neurologists, GPS, many PWP have no knowledge of these devastating side effects. PDUK had done very little to publicise the problem although it has been known about for the last 10 years. Latest research in France shows 50% of patients will suffer devastating impulse control disorders in time, as doses increase. The drug companies involved deliberately keep us in the dark to hang on to their massive profits. Those of us who have got caught up in this nightmare try to support each other and get the message out there to prevent more people falling into this pit. You have been shocked at the reality of the side effects and are now less likely to suffer…you will hopefully now have family or friends watching out for signs of ICDs. Maybe you will warn other Parkinsons patients. That is what we damaged families want.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4574306965808787720/Parkinson's-Disease-and-Employment	Parkinson's Disease and Employment	"HOME › UNDERSTANDING PARKINSON'S › Living with Parkinson's. Parkinson's and Employment. Will Parkinson's disease affect my ability to work? Like every other activity in your life, the extent to which Parkinson's disease may affect your ability to work depends on the type and severity of your symptoms and the extent to which those symptoms interfere with the duties of your particular job. There are some Parkinson's patients who are still working 20 years after diagnosis. Others have been unable to continue in their jobs after a year or two. For example, if you are a house painter and have balance problems, climbing a ladder may be dangerous. Generally speaking, most people can expect to be able to work for several years before Parkinson's disease substantially interferes with their ability to function. Am I protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Job protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is available only if you are ""disabled,"" inform your employer of your disability, and request a ""reasonable accommodation"" to allow you to continue to do your job at a satisfactory level. At the same time, many people understandably prefer to keep their personal and professional lives separate, out of fear that if they tell their employer, they will be eventually be terminated on some pretext that disguises the employer's real reason -- the employee's Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease in its advanced stages is recognized by the federal government as a disability, allowing those affected to secure the protections of the ADA. The actual determination of disability is made by the individual states according to federal standards. However, because the ADA requires an individual to be impaired in some material way affecting his daily life, not every Parkinson's patient will meet the standards set. If one seeks a determination at an early stage of the disease, it is unlikely that the claim will meet the standards of an accepted disability. An additional note on the ADA, from the Houston Business Journal : ""Since Congress passed the ADA in 1990, courts have attempted to juggle the sweeping statutory and regulatory text, the realities of the workplace and the ADA's mandate to protect the disabled. The courts have, for the most part, narrowed the viable claims under the ADA. As a result, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has experienced an annual decrease in the number of disability charges it receives, and the percentage of federal cases in which plaintiffs have prevailed under the ADA has decreased annually. It is likely that this trend will continue."" (Ted Meyer, February 2002.). Should I tell my employer, and if so, when? Each situation is different and much depends on your relationship with your boss or employer. But spend some time thinking this through before you make up your mind. You can be fired for any reason except for discrimination of race, age, gender or disability under some very narrow circumstances. Being disabled doesn't protect your job. You can be fired if you can no longer perform your job satisfactorily. Even the nicest boss in the world has an obligation to keep the business running. You may not want to ""come out"" at work until you are ready to ask for accommodation, as outlined in the ADA (see above). In general, the decision of whether to inform your employer is dependent on individual factors to such an extent that one-size-fits-all advice is not possible. Many Parkinson's patients find that they receive far more support than they thought they would, but that depends on their reputation before Parkinson's disease, the quality of the company they work for, and their ability to make meaningful contributions despite the disease. We believe it is best to make your decision based on these highly individual circumstances. Where conflict with your employer is unavoidable, however, you should consult with an attorney who practices in this area. One other note about Parkinson's disease in the workplace: If you have a personal preference not to tell your employer or co-workers about your Parkinson's disease, and your symptoms are not apparent, then you may well be able to keep it to yourself. However, it has been our experience that most Parkinson's patients are surprised to find that their co-workers have guessed their condition long before they thought their symptoms were noticeable. They may not have surmised that you have Parkinson's disease, but they've noticed something is not right. The symptoms of Parkinson's disease can appear as drunkenness, for example. You may consider telling only your close co-workers, but when considering who to tell and who not to tell, remember, if you have told anyone at work, you may find that you have told everyone at work. What happens financially if I can no longer work? That depends on your situation when you stop working. If you are already of retirement age, and are fully vested in your pension, you probably will retire much as if you would if you did not have Parkinson's disease. Some pension plans include medical benefits that may even cover prescription medications . In some cases, you may be eligible for early retirement, which generally reduces the amount of your benefits by a percentage that depends on how many years away from full retirement you are when you stop working. You may also have a 401(k) or other retirement savings plan that you've been contributing to while working. Under certain circumstances, a disabled person may draw down the assets in such funds before age 59 1/2, but there may be penalties or taxation consequences that make this undesirable.

With a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Nutrition, she would be a boon to many groups. I don't think she could go directly into work as a dietitian; but she might consider a Dietetic Technician position to start with. That would help get up to speed while studying for the RD exam. Meantime, if she chooses, Parkinson support groups are almost always looking for nutritional help and she might do some volunteer work designing meals and menu plans around nutrient-dense recipes. That would broaden her experience with PD while pursuing her goal of RD. For her internship, she could ask for a rotation that included working with a PD support group. I hope this helps, let me know; and I wish her the very best in this excellent goal! 	1	0	"Please|recommend|""|food|as|medicine|""|items|for|our|Parkinson's|support|group"	It's|wonderful|that|your|wife|has|a|strong|background|in|nutrition|,|that's|a|great|help|to|you|both|.|With|a|Bachelor|of|Science|degree|in|Human|Nutrition|,|she|would|be|a|boon|to|many|groups|.|I|don't|think|she|could|go|directly|into|work|as|a|dietitian|;|but|she|might|consider|a|Dietetic|Technician|position|to|start|with|.|That|would|help|get|up|to|speed|while|studying|for|the|RD|exam|.|Meantime|,|if|she|chooses|,|Parkinson|support|groups|are|almost|always|looking|for|nutritional|help|and|she|might|do|some|volunteer|work|designing|meals|and|menu|plans|around|nutrient-dense|recipes|.|That|would|broaden|her|experience|with|PD|while|pursuing|her|goal|of|RD|.|For|her|internship|,|she|could|ask|for|a|rotation|that|included|working|with|a|PD|support|group|.|I|hope|this|helps|,|let|me|know|;|and|I|wish|her|the|very|best|in|this|excellent|goal|!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693760555720603071/Parkinson's,-B6,-B12,-and-Folate---What's-the-Connection?	Parkinson's, B6, B12, and Folate - What's the Connection?	Hi Karen, good to hear from you. Lab values for plasma Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate) generally range from around 5 - 24 ng/ml although different labs can have slightly different ranges. Unless your doctor has interpreted this lab value as low end, that would put you about in the middle, so I don't think there's a need to increase your level at this time. You're doing exactly the right thing in consuming foods rich in B6, because that is far, far less likely to block levodopa absorption.

On a 23andMe forum discussion, I learned that I have a genetic variant that may cause health problems which should be treated with methylcobalamin and methylfolate: ""If you are A/G at rs1801133, and G/T at rs1801131 [which I am], then your status is compound heterozygous C677T/A1298C... you would expect to have ~65% of the normal MTHFR enzyme activity."" So, a couple of years ago I requested &amp; received the test results below from my doctor, which she said were in normal range. However, online I found comments from some MTHFR ""experts"" who claimed that even if you had levels considered ""normal"" by doctors, their tests were not necessarily valid for some reason (?), as well as warnings from some about dangerous Overmethylation if you took too much B12, etc. Also, I think I had already been trying supplements before the tests, so that may have skewed them. I haven't been able to find anyone I trust to consult and my doctors have no knowledge or interest. I do know there has been some recent research on possible links between PD and MTHFR. Anyway, here are my results. Any comments, or any ideas on where I might find a reliable health professional to guide me? B12: 908 pg/mL (later test showed &gt;1000). B6: 4.1ng/L. D: 44ng/mL.

I have Parkinson's, not lupus, but my 20 y.o. daughter (adopted) has a birth family history of lupus, some possible symptoms, but not full blown lupus yet. Her 23andMe genetic tests showed a higher lupus risk, plus higher risk (or carrier status?) for hemochromatosis. She's very thin, has little appetite, moody, and seems to get sick easily. To my surprise, she recently asked me to find her recommendations for vitamins, supplements, and nutrition. I know this isn't Parkinson's related, but would like to help her and would greatly appreciate any suggestions you might be able to give me. She finds it very difficult to swallow pills, esp. large ones, so all my many attempts to get her to take vitamins while growing up failed. Therefore, I'm very pleased that she's now apparently willing to try it and want to encourage it if possible before she changes her mind!

I want to reply, but I feel helpless. You evidently already see a counselor, I'm glad. A possibility did occur to me though. When I worked on the geriatric psych unit, we would from time to time treat unremitting depression with ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). I noticed on the doctors forum this was briefly discussed as an innovative Parkinson's treatment. I wonder if this might be an option for you. The advantage is that, while medications are used in the anesthesia prior to the actual (induced, brief) seizure, it is basically a drug-free therapy.

Although I'm not tremor free (never claimed to be more than 95%), I'm only experiencing a slight increase which is very livable. The jury is still out as to whether or not I can get off of Sinemet completely. I'll go as far as I can and then speak with my Neuro. Maybe I need to increase my Ursodiol dosage but I don't want to do that on my own. I'll discuss it with my Neuro at our next appointment.

Fox Foundation	"HOME › UNDERSTANDING PARKINSON'S ›. Advice for Loved Ones and Caregivers. The below content has been reviewed by Rachel Dolhun, MD, the Foundation's on-staff movement disorder specialist. Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease has a ripple effect, radiating from an individual to his or her family and friends. When hearing of a loved one's diagnosis, many questions may come to mind. How will this impact our relationship, our future -- my life? Building a care partnership. Sharing in your loved one's journey with Parkinson's disease (PD), means integrating the diagnosis together into your lives, adapting your routine and supporting him or her as the disease progresses -- essentially, establishing a care partnership . This can sometimes be challenging; from learning about the disease and how best to help your loved one, to remembering to also care for yourself. There are steps you can take to help adjust to your new role as a care partner while maintaining a healthy and supportive relationship with your loved one. We asked caregivers in our community for their advice to provide a roadmap for filling this role. HOW CAN I HELP MANAGE MY LOVED ONE'S CARE? Become an integral part of your loved one's experience with Parkinson's by offering to help share the responsibilities associated with the disease including doctor appointments, therapy sessions, medication administration, household duties or any activity that's more difficult to perform because of Parkinson's disease. People with Parkinson's will desire different levels of assistance and some wish to maintain as much independence as possible. You won't know if a person wants help unless you ask but then respect their response. Communication about these issues is key to understanding how best to help your loved one. Ask your loved one if you can attend doctor's visits. Care partners play a major role on the team of people treating Parkinson's. You offer an outside view of how your loved one has been doing in the interim since the last visit. You may also recognize new symptoms or subtle changes that the person experiencing Parkinson's doesn't. For example, your loved one's mood or behaviors may have changed and he or she may be more withdrawn. These could be signs of depression, which is a clinical symptom of PD and is treatable with medication. A person with Parkinson's might otherwise dismiss this as a reaction to the diagnosis of PD or not even mention it to the doctor. You may also have noticed that your loved one's speech has become softer or more monotone. This may impact your ability to communicate and therefore your relationship. Speech therapists can prescribe exercises to improve voice control. You and your loved one can decide together on management options offered and with two sets of ears tuning in, you can both be clear on the treatment plan. As a caregiver, keeping track of all the details associated with medical care can be overwhelming. Here are some tips to help:. * Stay organized with a calendar that you can take on doctor visits. Note doctor and therapy appointments, start and stop dates of medicines, and any side effects you notice. * Keep a list of all doctors' phone numbers and addresses in case of an emergency. Keep a separate and updated list of all prescription medications, their dosages and instructions and prescribing provider. Note allergies or medication intolerances as well. * Familiarize yourself with the terms of your loved one's medical insurance. Know what services, including prescription medication coverage and therapy session benefits, are included. Talk with your physician about the long-term needs of your loved one, and make sure his or her current medical plan will meet those needs. Engage the services of a social worker if you need help navigating these issues. * Know your rights in terms of disability coverage, family leave and elder rights. If possible, consult a movement disorder specialist , a neurologist specially trained in Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. Before appointments, prepare a list of your questions for the doctor. Particularly in the early days after diagnosis, your list may include questions on:. You do not need special medical training to help with any but the most advanced stages of the disease. Most caregivers are primarily called on to aid with daily tasks that may become difficult or impossible for someone with Parkinson's, and to provide ongoing emotional support. One exception: if Parkinson's causes trouble swallowing and therefore increases the risk of choking, knowing the Heimlich maneuver can be life-saving. HOW WILL PARKINSON'S AFFECT MY RELATIONSHIP? Parkinson's disease can place stress on a marriage or relationship. The fatigue and motor difficulties of the disease can cause changes in your partner's appearance and influence their contribution to household chores. Cognitive and mood changes may make it hard to initiate and follow through on everyday tasks, which can be frustrating for both of you. Effective communication is vital for the long-term health of your marriage. As with any other important development that affects the lives of two people who are close, Parkinson's disease should be discussed openly and honestly. Do not consider your own concerns as a caregiver less important. If your loved one chooses not to reveal his or her diagnosis right away, you may feel uncomfortable being less than truthful in response to questions from others. There is no simple answer of how best to support your partner in this situation. Discuss your concerns with your partner but also listen to their reasoning. Consider the implications of sharing a diagnosis on your social interactions and your loved one's career. If you feel comfortable doing so, visit a counselor or therapist together or individually to work through the many changes and emotions you are experiencing and to learn how you can preserve and grow your relationship. HOW CAN I CARE FOR MYSELF? Caring for a person with a chronic illness full-time can be overwhelming. Put together a list of friends and family members whom you trust and can call upon to relieve you for a few hours or in case of an emergency. Consider seeking outside, professional help for in-home assistance if you can afford it. Don't forget your own interests and your life outside of Parkinson's disease. Schedule regular social activities and time for yourself. Go out with friends, enjoy a physical activity independently or take classes that interest you. For Parkinson's patients who require constant care, check out local programs that will take care of them on a temporary basis (sometimes called ""respite care""). This will allow you the time to seek the support and rest that you need. Caregivers may react to Parkinson's diagnosis with denial, fear or anger. Seeing your loved one change, particularly if mood or behavior are altered, can be hard to not take personally. Talking openly about what you are experiencing, and clearly communicating on a day-to-day basis, are critical for both the Parkinson's patient and the caregiver. Support groups offer the opportunity to share experiences and information with empathetic ears. There are groups for Parkinson's patients and their loved ones to attend together and separate groups just for caregivers. Keep in mind that each group has a different character and you may have to try several before finding a right fit. If there are no support groups in your area that you like, consider starting your own. Online forums can also be a source of support. Remember that Parkinson's disease and its course are different for everyone. How you and your loved one navigate the disease is dependent on your individual relationship and personalities. Over time you will be able to come to an agreement on what constitutes the most effective, supportive and beneficial care partnership for you both. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR LOVED ONES AND CAREGIVERS.

Research Grant, 2016. Study Rationale:. Temporary periods of poor mobility and other symptoms (OFF periods) are common in Parkinson s disease and are associated with poorer quality of life. OFF symptoms are complex, with both motor and non-motor aspects, which makes communication and proper treatment of these symptoms challenging. How patients, care partners, and health care professionals each perceive and communicate about OFF symptoms is not well understood. We aim to better understand the impact of OFF periods on people with Parkinson s disease and their care partners, and to identify factors that either improve or worsen communication about OFF periods between patients, care partners, and health care professionals. Study Design:. This study will be conducted in three phases. Firstly, we shall search through and summarize the existing information on the impact and communication of OFF periods on patients and care partners. We shall use the information gathered from the first phase to guide the second phase, in which we shall separately interview 20 patients with Parkinson s disease, care partners, and physicians each about their personal experiences and impact of OFF periods, and how they each communicate about OFF symptoms. The results of the interviews will be used to design a survey for the third phase of the study. The survey will be distributed to 100 patients, 100 care partners, and 100 physicians to obtain standardized information about the impact and communication of OFF periods from a larger sample of each of the above groups of people. Impact on Diagnosis/Treatment of Parkinson  s Disease:. Improved understanding of the factors that improve or worsen communication about OFF periods between patients, care partners, and physicians will help improve communication about complex and variable OFF symptoms, allowing for more appropriate treatment of these symptoms in the individual patient with Parkinson s disease. Next Steps for Development:. Once factors that improve or worsen communication about OFF symptoms have been identified, publication of materials that educate patients, care partners, and physicians regarding these can be developed to improve communication and treatment of OFF periods.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4574306970443938627/Parkinson's-Research-Study-Shows-Inosine-Compound-Raises-Urate-Levels	Parkinson's Research Study Shows Inosine Compound Raises Urate Levels	"HOME › ABOUT THE FOUNDATION › Press Releases ›. December 23,2013. Potential Neuroprotective Therapy Ready for Next Stage of Development after Michael J. Fox Foundation Funding. New findings published in JAMA Neurology from research into a potentially protective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) show that with medical supervision, urate levels may safely be raised while mitigating risk of complications such as gout. Previous research showed that higher levels of the antioxidant urate were associated with lower risk and slower progression of PD. In the Phase II Safety of Urate Elevation in Parkinson's Disease (SURE-PD) study -- led by Parkinson Study Group (PSG) investigators and funded by The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research (MJFF) -- researchers found that oral ingestion of the urate precursor inosine is safe and tolerable and raises levels of urate in the blood and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bathing the brain. SURE-PD grew out of results from two previous prospective studies that showed higher levels of urate in serum or cerebrospinal fluid at baseline predicted slower rates of Parkinson's progression, as measured clinically and with imaging technologies. Raising urate levels also was found to be neuroprotective in pre-clinical models of the disease. PD patients should not self-medicate with inosine (which is commercially available), researchers warn, as it has not been proven as a therapy for Parkinson's and high doses can cause side effects such as gout and kidney stones and possibly high blood pressure. More research into inosine is needed to characterize the effect on Parkinson's and, if positive, define dosage and treatment regimens. ""We intend to find out whether inosine can be used as a protective therapy to delay Parkinson's in people at risk and slow disease progression in those already diagnosed,"" said lead investigator Michael Schwarzschild, MD, PhD, of Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Such a disease-modifying therapy is a critical goal of PD research, and would greatly improve quality of life and prognosis for the millions living with this disease."" Schwarzschild also cites the potential of urate as a biomarker: a biological characteristic associated with the risk or presence of disease. Learning more about how urate levels present in different stages of Parkinson's can allow researchers to identify people at higher risk for PD, who may benefit from earlier intervention, and stratify clinical trials toward individuals with higher likelihood to respond to the treatment. MJFF invested more than $5 million in SURE-PD in 2008, the Foundation's largest single grant at that time. Such early-stage funding is in line with MJFF's de-risking strategy meant to kick-start promising PD research projects and carry them to a stage attractive to other investors (e.g. pharmaceutical companies, private funders and/or the government). While these results of the Phase II study set the stage for further development of inosine as a treatment for Parkinson's, industry interest may present a roadblock to drug development. Inosine is currently available as a supplement marketed for athletic performance improvement. This makes the compound less desirable for commercial investors whose business models rely on patenting and profiting from new drugs. The PSG SURE-PD investigators call for ""the development of a more definitive trial to investigate the ability of inosine treatment to slow clinical progression among persons with early PD who have lower urate."" While they actively seek funding interest, patients wait for results.

After ruling out that it was not a cause for concern she lowered his BP med to try and see it was attributing to him sleeping so much. She said at this point she wanted him to have quality of life and hoped it would help. Today we saw the OMT (Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy) doc and when l mentioned the increased hard tremors and C/L increase and the amount of his sleeping he was doing, he brought up the quality of life comment as well. He said to try and get an hour twice a day of awake time, more if he can, and that may be all we can expect. He said this is definitely PD progression. It was very discouraging as you can imagine. I don't get upset in front of hubby, but it was hard not to today! His response to both doctors was as if he didn't hear, he never asks questions after a visit and as far as l can tell is blissfully unaware. Just venting here as this group understands. 	1	1	Quality|of|life|as|it|pertains|to|Parkinson's	Last|week|my|husband|saw|his|Cardiologist|concerning|a|PAC|episode|caught|during|a|EKG|at|our|PCP|office|.|After|ruling|out|that|it|was|not|a|cause|for|concern|she|lowered|his|BP|med|to|try|and|see|it|was|attributing|to|him|sleeping|so|much|.|She|said|at|this|point|she|wanted|him|to|have|quality|of|life|and|hoped|it|would|help|.|Today|we|saw|the|OMT|(|Osteopathic|Manipulative|Therapy|)|doc|and|when|l|mentioned|the|increased|hard|tremors|and|C|/|L|increase|and|the|amount|of|his|sleeping|he|was|doing|,|he|brought|up|the|quality|of|life|comment|as|well|.|He|said|to|try|and|get|an|hour|twice|a|day|of|awake|time|,|more|if|he|can|,|and|that|may|be|all|we|can|expect|.|He|said|this|is|definitely|PD|progression|.|It|was|very|discouraging|as|you|can|imagine|.|I|don't|get|upset|in|front|of|hubby|,|but|it|was|hard|not|to|today|!|His|response|to|both|doctors|was|as|if|he|didn't|hear|,|he|never|asks|questions|after|a|visit|and|as|far|as|l|can|tell|is|blissfully|unaware|.|Just|venting|here|as|this|group|understands|.

Looking at this site and reading caregiver's comments, thoughts, support, etc. Has been helpful. I feel very alone in this, afraid, and angry. the comments supporting Elizabeth spoke to me too and I think I'm ready to go for a long walk on a sunny, 35 degree day. I can cry as much as I need while walking with sunglasses on. Not many people home in the neighborhood on a weekday anyway. I find crying and pushing myself to take the route with some hills clears the mind and Provides a good load of endorphins! I am so very grateful to find this group! We have been together for 40+ years. He is a war veteran with chronic PTSD, head injury, on and on. There is a long story in there but now is not the time. Support groups for spouses of vets don't exist where we live, with the exception of a few special folks both of our families chose to label him as crazy, and socializing is difficult for him. My closest friend is suffering memory loss which is a major loss to me. as someone said... It is what it is!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4708400695467999940/UVA-scientists-find-potential-explanation-for-mysterious-cell-death-in-Alzheimers,-Parkinsons	UVA scientists find potential explanation for mysterious cell death in Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s	Feb 15 2019. Genetic variation in individual neurons may have big effect as we age. Scientists at the University of Virginia School of Medicine have identified a potential explanation for the mysterious death of specific brain cells seen in Alzheimer’s , Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative diseases . Genetic variations inside individual neurons may explain the mysterious cell death seen in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases, UVA researcher Michael McConnell, PhD, has determined. The new research suggests that the cells may die because of naturally occurring gene variation in brain cells that were, until recently, assumed to be genetically identical. This variation – called “somatic mosaicism” – could explain why neurons in the temporal lobe are the first to die in Alzheimer’s, for example, and why dopaminergic neurons are the first to die in Parkinson’s. This has been a big open question in neuroscience, particularly in various neurodegenerative diseases. What is this selective vulnerability? What underlies it? And so now, with our work, the hypotheses moving forward are that it could be that different regions of the brain actually have a different garden of these [variations] in young individuals and that sets up different regions for decline later in life.”. Neuroscientist Michael McConnell, PhD, UVA’s Center for Brain Immunology and Glia (BIG). A most unexpected outcome. The finding emerged unexpectedly from McConnell’s investigations into schizophrenia. It was in that context that he and his collaborators first discovered the unexpected variation in the genetic makeup of individual brain cells. That discovery may help explain not just schizophrenia but depression, bipolar disorder, autism and other conditions. Continuing his investigations, McConnell expected that this mosaicism would increase with age – that mutations would accumulate over time. What he and his collaborators at Johns Hopkins found is exactly the opposite: Younger people had the most mosaicism and older people had the least. We wound up building an atlas that contained neurons from 15 individuals. None of these individuals had disease. They ranged in age from less than a year to 94 years, and it showed a perfect correlation – a perfect anti-correlation – with age.”. Michael McConnell, PhD, UVA’s Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics and UVA’s Department of Neuroscience. Based on the finding, McConnell believes that the neurons with significant genetic variation, known as CNV neurons, may be the most vulnerable to dying. And that could explain the idiosyncratic death of specific neurons in different neurodegenerative diseases. People with the most CNV neurons in the temporal lobe, for example, might be likely to develop Alzheimer’s. More work needs to be done to fully understand what’s occurring, McConnell said. So far, he has only looked at neurons in the frontal cortex of the brain, and his studies are limited by the fact that neurons can be examined only after death, so it can be hard to make direct comparisons. But he is excited to expand the scope of his research. “Because I'm collaborating with the Lieber Institute and they have this fantastic brain bank, now I can look at individuals’ frontal cortex [for the schizophrenia research] and I can look at the temporal lobe in those same individuals,” McConnell said. “So now I can really start to map things out more carefully, building an atlas of different brain regions from many individuals.”. That research could greatly advance our understanding of both neurodegenerative diseases and the cognitive decline that besets us with age, potentially leading to new treatments. “What's really interesting about mosaicism is that it is fundamentally tweaking our assumptions about what nature is, because we've kind of always assumed that every cell in any given individual had the same genome, the same DNA in every cell,” McConnell said. “And now we're showing that it’s different and what that might mean.”. 	1	0	UVA|scientists|find|potential|explanation|for|mysterious|cell|death|in|Alzheimer|’|s|,|Parkinson|’|s	Feb|15|2019|.|Genetic|variation|in|individual|neurons|may|have|big|effect|as|we|age|.|Scientists|at|the|University|of|Virginia|School|of|Medicine|have|identified|a|potential|explanation|for|the|mysterious|death|of|specific|brain|cells|seen|in|Alzheimer|’|s|,|Parkinson|’|s|and|other|neurodegenerative|diseases|.|Genetic|variations|inside|individual|neurons|may|explain|the|mysterious|cell|death|seen|in|Alzheimer's|,|Parkinson's|and|other|neurodegenerative|diseases|,|UVA|researcher|Michael|McConnell|,|PhD|,|has|determined|.|The|new|research|suggests|that|the|cells|may|die|because|of|naturally|occurring|gene|variation|in|brain|cells|that|were|,|until|recently|,|assumed|to|be|genetically|identical|.|This|variation|–|called|“|somatic|mosaicism|”|–|could|explain|why|neurons|in|the|temporal|lobe|are|the|first|to|die|in|Alzheimer|’|s|,|for|example|,|and|why|dopaminergic|neurons|are|the|first|to|die|in|Parkinson|’|s|.|This|has|been|a|big|open|question|in|neuroscience|,|particularly|in|various|neurodegenerative|diseases|.|What|is|this|selective|vulnerability|?|What|underlies|it|?|And|so|now|,|with|our|work|,|the|hypotheses|moving|forward|are|that|it|could|be|that|different|regions|of|the|brain|actually|have|a|different|garden|of|these|[|variations|]|in|young|individuals|and|that|sets|up|different|regions|for|decline|later|in|life|.|”|.|Neuroscientist|Michael|McConnell|,|PhD|,|UVA|’|s|Center|for|Brain|Immunology|and|Glia|(|BIG|)|.|A|most|unexpected|outcome|.|The|finding|emerged|unexpectedly|from|McConnell|’|s|investigations|into|schizophrenia|.|It|was|in|that|context|that|he|and|his|collaborators|first|discovered|the|unexpected|variation|in|the|genetic|makeup|of|individual|brain|cells|.|That|discovery|may|help|explain|not|just|schizophrenia|but|depression|,|bipolar|disorder|,|autism|and|other|conditions|.|Continuing|his|investigations|,|McConnell|expected|that|this|mosaicism|would|increase|with|age|–|that|mutations|would|accumulate|over|time|.|What|he|and|his|collaborators|at|Johns|Hopkins|found|is|exactly|the|opposite|:|Younger|people|had|the|most|mosaicism|and|older|people|had|the|least|.|We|wound|up|building|an|atlas|that|contained|neurons|from|15|individuals|.|None|of|these|individuals|had|disease|.|They|ranged|in|age|from|less|than|a|year|to|94|years|,|and|it|showed|a|perfect|correlation|–|a|perfect|anti-correlation|–|with|age|.|”|.|Michael|McConnell|,|PhD|,|UVA|’|s|Department|of|Biochemistry|and|Molecular|Genetics|and|UVA|’|s|Department|of|Neuroscience|.|Based|on|the|finding|,|McConnell|believes|that|the|neurons|with|significant|genetic|variation|,|known|as|CNV|neurons|,|may|be|the|most|vulnerable|to|dying|.|And|that|could|explain|the|idiosyncratic|death|of|specific|neurons|in|different|neurodegenerative|diseases|.|People|with|the|most|CNV|neurons|in|the|temporal|lobe|,|for|example|,|might|be|likely|to|develop|Alzheimer|’|s|.|More|work|needs|to|be|done|to|fully|understand|what|’|s|occurring|,|McConnell|said|.|So|far|,|he|has|only|looked|at|neurons|in|the|frontal|cortex|of|the|brain|,|and|his|studies|are|limited|by|the|fact|that|neurons|can|be|examined|only|after|death|,|so|it|can|be|hard|to|make|direct|comparisons|.|But|he|is|excited|to|expand|the|scope|of|his|research|.|“|Because|I'm|collaborating|with|the|Lieber|Institute|and|they|have|this|fantastic|brain|bank|,|now|I|can|look|at|individuals|’|frontal|cortex|[|for|the|schizophrenia|research|]|and|I|can|look|at|the|temporal|lobe|in|those|same|individuals|,|”|McConnell|said|.|“|So|now|I|can|really|start|to|map|things|out|more|carefully|,|building|an|atlas|of|different|brain|regions|from|many|individuals|.|”|.|That|research|could|greatly|advance|our|understanding|of|both|neurodegenerative|diseases|and|the|cognitive|decline|that|besets|us|with|age|,|potentially|leading|to|new|treatments|.|“|What's|really|interesting|about|mosaicism|is|that|it|is|fundamentally|tweaking|our|assumptions|about|what|nature|is|,|because|we've|kind|of|always|assumed|that|every|cell|in|any|given|individual|had|the|same|genome|,|the|same|DNA|in|every|cell|,|”|McConnell|said|.|“|And|now|we're|showing|that|it|’|s|different|and|what|that|might|mean|.|”|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4707810023368627014/New-method-uses-fluorescence-to-identify-disease-causing-forms-of-proteins	New method uses fluorescence to identify disease-causing forms of proteins	"13-Feb-2019 Penn State. The new AggTag method allows researchers to see the previously undetectable but potentially disease-causing intermediate forms of proteins as they misfold. The method uses fluorescence to simultaneously detect two different proteins (red, green) within the cell (blue). A new method uses fluorescence to detect potentially disease-causing forms of proteins as they unravel due to stress or mutations. A team of researchers from Penn State and the University of Washington reengineered a fluorescent compound and developed a method to simultaneously light up two different proteins as they misfold and aggregate inside a living cell, highlighting forms that likely play a role in several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Two recent papers describing the method appear online in ChemBioChem and the Journal of the American Chemical Society . ""In order to function properly, proteins fold into very precise structures, but environmental stress or pathogenic mutations can cause proteins to misfold and aggregate,"" said Xin Zhang, assistant professor of chemistry and of biochemistry and molecular biology at Penn State and leader of the research team. ""Protein aggregation is a multi-step process, and it is believed that the intermediate form, which previous imaging techniques could not detect, is responsible for a number of diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Type 2 Diabetes, and cystic fibrosis. We developed the Aggregation Tag method--AggTag--to see these previously undetectable intermediates--soluble oligomers--as well the final aggregates in live cells."" Previous techniques to identify protein aggregation used fluorescent compounds that were always lit up, which made it impossible to distinguish properly folded proteins from the intermediate form because both trigger low-level diffuse fluorescence. The AggTag method uses ""turn-on fluorescence,"" so the compound only lights up when misfolding starts to occur. ""When the fluorescent compound has plenty of space to move, it rotates freely and remains turned off, as in the presence of a properly folded protein,"" said Yu Liu, assistant research professor of chemistry at Penn State and the key developer of AggTag method. ""But when the protein starts to misfold and aggregate, the compound's movement becomes restricted and it begins to light up. Diffuse fluorescence indicates that intermediate oligomers are present, while small points of brighter fluorescence indicate that the denser insoluble aggregates are present."" To allow for this distinction between forms, the research team reengineered the color-causing core of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is commonly used in imaging studies because it fluoresces when exposed to certain wavelengths of light. The reengineered compound binds to a tag, which in turn fuses to a protein targeted for imaging. The research team used two different kinds of commercially available tags, Halo-tag and SNAP-tag, which when used with AggTag can induce red or green fluorescence, respectively. Because Halo-tags and SNAP-tags do not interact with each other, they can be used to simultaneously image two different proteins with the two colors. The team also engineered the tags so that the green and red colors can be reversed, giving researchers options for future imaging. ""We plan to continue developing this method so that we can signal the transition of oligomers into insoluble aggregates using a color change,"" said Zhang. ""This method provides a new toolbox to study protein aggregation, which is currently a highly studied topic among scientists. Hopefully this will allow us to better understand the entire process of protein aggregation and the role of each of these forms in the progression of neurodegenerative and other diseases."" ###.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4707279752072676488/Rapid-progression-of-age-related-diseases-may-result-from-formation-of-vicious-cycles	Rapid progression of age-related diseases may result from formation of vicious cycles	"Reviewed by James Ives, MPsych Feb 12 2019. Biologist Aleksey Belikov from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology has proposed that rapid progression of age-related diseases may result from the formation of so-called vicious cycles. An example of this is when toxic products of a biochemical reaction trigger that same reaction to happen again. The study, published in the January issue of Ageing Research Reviews , highlights the most promising options for age-related disease treatment that focus on interrupting vicious cycles. Statistical data indicate that the mortality rates due to all major age-related diseases increase exponentially with age. The MIPT researcher hypothesized that the reason behind this self-aggravating disease progression is the indefinite repetition of reaction cycles, which increases the harm from the initially noncritical changes in the body manyfold. It is these cycles that prospective therapies might address. ""Age-related diseases in humans are nearly impossible to prevent, though the search for so-called geroprotectors continues,"" said the paper's author Aleksey Belikov, who holds a doctorate in natural sciences and is a researcher at MIPT's Laboratory of Innovative Medicine. ""The therapies that are being developed now aim to prevent disease progression."" ""Investigating the mechanisms behind age-related disease progression, one concludes that by the time the disease has been diagnosed, it is too late to address the triggering factors,"" the biologist explained. ""Apparently the most effective strategy is to interrupt the known vicious cycles by blocking certain stages in them. Drugs doing just that are already being developed."" In his study, Belikov examined the mortality rates of patients with five most widespread diseases that tend to affect elderly people more often, leading these diseases to be widely regarded as age-related: atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Mortality statistics are the most powerful and least biased tool for studying diseases, since they account for the natural progression of a disease under various life conditions across a large population. Exponential, or geometric, growth is observed in nuclear reactions, water freezing, bacterial growth, avalanches, and other phenomena. To use the example of bacteria, one might imagine a bacterium in a test tube that divides once every second, and its offspring divide once every second, etc. Say it takes the bacteria four hours to fill up the entire test tube. The tube will be half-full just one second before the end of the experiment, yet four seconds earlier it's just over 3 percent full. That is, the growth rate accelerates rapidly. A detailed analysis of age-related diseases revealed that they progress exponentially due to reactions on the molecular or cellular level producing pathogenic products which in turn initiate the very reactions that produced them. That way the harmful products quickly multiply, and the disease progresses at an ever increasing rate, like an avalanche. The MIPT researcher investigated the mechanisms of each of the five age-related diseases in the study, identifying the molecular and cellular reactions that result in vicious cycles. He noted that even substances or factors which do not in themselves pose any critical health risks might nevertheless initiate a vicious cycle of reactions. As a result, the amount and impact of the cycle's toxic component is amplified uncontrollably. This means that a lethal effect might stem from an initially noncritical amount of a harmless substance. For example, nerve cells in the brain contain a small amount of a protein called alpha synuclein, which is involved in nerve impulse transmission. It may happen that the gene encoding alpha synuclein is mutated, duplicated, or triplicated in a genome. This leads to multiple protein molecules sticking to one another, forming so-called toxic oligomers, which then grow in size by attaching other alpha synuclein molecules. This process produces fibrils, which from time to time break up into oligomers, each of which eventually grows into a new fibril, etc. This chain reaction causes the number of toxic alpha synuclein oligomers to grow exponentially, forestalling the exponential growth of the mortality rate due to Parkinson's disease with patient age. While it is almost impossible to eliminate the oligomers that have already formed, their further growth might be prevented pharmacologically, halting the progression of the disease. ""All the vicious cycles this paper deals with are based on prior studies of age-related diseases,"" said Belikov. ""New studies could complement or even radically change our understanding of what reactions constitute the cycles. Yet the notion of positive feedback loops, or vicious cycles, behind the exponential progression of age-related diseases will most likely remain.""? Source:.

"Depiction of the four most important issues that need to be addressed in the next 10 years regarding the gut in PD. Credit: Servier Medical Art, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. There is growing evidence that at least in some patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), the disease may begin in the gut. Writing in a special supplement to the Journal of Parkinson's Disease , experts explore the last two decades of research about the gut-brain axis in PD and look ahead at the possible development and impact of these research areas in the next two decades. PD is a slowly progressive disorder that affects movement, muscle control, and balance. In the last 20 years it has become clear that PD is associated with a number of gastrointestinal symptoms originating from functional and structural changes in the gut and its associated neural structures. Many patients with PD suffer from gut-related symptoms such as constipation, which have an impact on quality of life. Accumulating evidence suggests that in at least a subgroup of patients, these disturbances happen years before the development of motor symptoms and diagnosis of PD and may therefore provide important insights into the origin and development of the disease . ""Better understanding the role of the gut in PD will help us to understand the origin of the disease and to improve treatments,"" explained Filip Scheperjans, MD, Ph.D., from the Department of Neurology, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland, and colleagues. ""There is accumulating evidence that at least in some PD patients, the origin of the disease may lie in the gut with possible involvement of abnormal protein aggregates, local inflammation, and the gut microbiome . Therefore, further studies into the role of the gut in PD are important and may reveal new possibilities for diagnosis and treatment."" The authors identified four key issues:. 1. Alpha-synuclein deposits are observed in the enteric nervous system (ENS) of PD patients However, it remains to be determined if the alpha-synuclein aggregates in the ENS are biochemically similar to the ones found in the brain as this might be critical in understanding the role of the gut in PD pathogenesis. 2. Triggering of initial alpha-synuclein aggregation in enteric nerve terminals through extrinsic factors could be facilitated by intestinal hyperpermeability. It remains to be definitely demonstrated that intestinal permeability is increased in PD. 3. Results of immunohistochemistry-based studies on alpha-synuclein deposits in the ENS of PD patients have provided conflicting results. There is therefore a critical need to develop alternative techniques to detect alpha-synuclein aggregates in the gut. 4. Alterations of gut microbiota composition in PD have been shown in multiple cross-sectional studies from diverse populations. It will be crucial to determine the mechanisms that connect gut microbiota and PD in large multicenter studies of PD patients before and after diagnosis as well as in animal models employing multiomics approaches. The authors predict that major advances will be made over the next 20 years in understanding the role of gastrointestinal alpha-synuclein pathology in the etiology of PD and explaining the degree of similarity between pathophysiological processes in PD and those of true prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Accessible and affordable methods such as radio-opaque markers to assess gastrointestinal transit times will find more widespread use in future studies. They believe there is good reason to envision that gut microbiota may have important implications in the future diagnostic and therapeutic landscape of PD and that therapeutic applications based on the gut microbiome are possible through a range of approaches, including dietary interventions, probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. And finally, that a more detailed understanding of microbiome-host-interactions in PD could identify new pathways that could be targeted using more traditional pharmacological approaches. ""Our understanding and appreciation of the importance of the gut-brain connection in PD has grown rapidly in recent years. We are confident that the coming two decades of microbiome-gut-brain-axis research will see an even accelerated development in this area that will reshape our understanding of the pathogenesis of PD,"" concluded Dr. Scheperjans. ""The gut has emerged as one of the new frontiers in PD research,"" commented Patrik Brundin, MD, Ph.D., Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA, and J. William Langston, MD, Stanford Udall Center, Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA, Editors-in-Chief of the Journal of Parkinson's Disease . ""We predict there will be several advances regarding the gut in the coming 20 years. Changes in the gut might be utilized to diagnose PD earlier; new therapies targeting these changes might slow disease progression, reduce constipation, and improve gut function in patients who have already been diagnosed.""

Researchers at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine studied how lifestyle factors can influence Parkinson's disease for patients. (Daily Bruin file photo) UCLA researchers found several lifestyle factors can protect Parkinson’s patients from worsening motor and cognitive functions. The study , published in the Journal of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society, evaluated how diverse lifestyles may impact the progression and survival of Parkinson’s disease patients. Parkinson’s disease affects nerve cells, causing deterioration of coordination and movement in a process called neurodegeneration. The disease is progressive, meaning the symptoms worsen as more neurons are destroyed. It causes involuntary tremors, slowed movement, rigidity and impaired balance in patients. While there is no cure for Parkinson’s disease, there are several treatment options available. Regular consumption of coffee and caffeinated tea and moderate consumption of alcohol can protect against at least one outcome of worsening Parkinson’s disease, according to the study. Coffee consumption was correlated with a decreased risk of mortality and delayed progression of worsening motor and cognitive functions in patients who participated in the study. On the other hand, patients who never drank coffee were found to have had Parkinson’s for longer and to have been diagnosed at a younger age. Moderate drinkers of alcohol were less likely to experience motor function deterioration than heavy drinkers and those who never drank liquor, according to the study. The researchers also found that physical activity and participation in competitive sports protected against cognitive decline. In addition, smoking was associated with quickened cognitive decline and increased risk of mortality, which contrasts with prior studies . 	1	1	Our|Parkinson's|Place|:|Researchers|identify|certain|factors|that|affect|Parkinson|’|s|disease|progression	BY|STEPHANIE|LAI|February|5|,|2019|.|Researchers|at|the|UCLA|Fielding|School|of|Public|Health|and|the|David|Geffen|School|of|Medicine|studied|how|lifestyle|factors|can|influence|Parkinson's|disease|for|patients|.|(|Daily|Bruin|file|photo|)|UCLA|researchers|found|several|lifestyle|factors|can|protect|Parkinson|’|s|patients|from|worsening|motor|and|cognitive|functions|.|The|study|,|published|in|the|Journal|of|the|International|Parkinson|and|Movement|Disorder|Society|,|evaluated|how|diverse|lifestyles|may|impact|the|progression|and|survival|of|Parkinson|’|s|disease|patients|.|Parkinson|’|s|disease|affects|nerve|cells|,|causing|deterioration|of|coordination|and|movement|in|a|process|called|neurodegeneration|.|The|disease|is|progressive|,|meaning|the|symptoms|worsen|as|more|neurons|are|destroyed|.|It|causes|involuntary|tremors|,|slowed|movement|,|rigidity|and|impaired|balance|in|patients|.|While|there|is|no|cure|for|Parkinson|’|s|disease|,|there|are|several|treatment|options|available|.|Regular|consumption|of|coffee|and|caffeinated|tea|and|moderate|consumption|of|alcohol|can|protect|against|at|least|one|outcome|of|worsening|Parkinson|’|s|disease|,|according|to|the|study|.|Coffee|consumption|was|correlated|with|a|decreased|risk|of|mortality|and|delayed|progression|of|worsening|motor|and|cognitive|functions|in|patients|who|participated|in|the|study|.|On|the|other|hand|,|patients|who|never|drank|coffee|were|found|to|have|had|Parkinson|’|s|for|longer|and|to|have|been|diagnosed|at|a|younger|age|.|Moderate|drinkers|of|alcohol|were|less|likely|to|experience|motor|function|deterioration|than|heavy|drinkers|and|those|who|never|drank|liquor|,|according|to|the|study|.|The|researchers|also|found|that|physical|activity|and|participation|in|competitive|sports|protected|against|cognitive|decline|.|In|addition|,|smoking|was|associated|with|quickened|cognitive|decline|and|increased|risk|of|mortality|,|which|contrasts|with|prior|studies|.

My reading is that the case in question was Parkinsonism - symptoms associated with PD (as in ""drug induced parkinsonism"") but quite specifically not PD - dopamine depletion due to damaged neurons in the substantia nigra. Moreover, quite specifically, based on a bowel exam, it concluded the patient had celiac disease. So someone with celiac disease improved by eliminating gluten from the diet. No shit Sherlock! (I like to get a poo reference in when I can ). That parkinsonism (not PD) may be a symptom of celiac disease is interesting, as is the possibility that many case of PD continue to be misdiagnosed.

My good news is that topical magnesium oil is a very effective pain reliever - thanks to easilly for putting me on to it. I also just tried a bottled alkaline water brand that seems really effective. How does it work? I'm not sure. While I don't put much stock into the ionizing thing (the ionization shouldn't last but a few seconds when exposed to air), the product also contains potassium bicarbonate, calcium chloride and magnesium chloride. The potassium bicarbonate is what is going to maintain alkalinity in the solution. There's been some interesting work on sodium bicarbonate [1] in water for reducing inflammation; potassium bicarbonate ought to work similarly, minus the extra sodium. Excess sodium consumption can encourage some types of autoimmune problems [2], whereas increasing potassium consumption may diminish them [3]. It's also possible that the magnesium chloride might be a better oral form of magnesium for me that the others I've tried so far (citrate, glycinate, taurate, malate - threonate is still on the Amazon list). Yes, it can cause loose stools if too much is consumed at once. 1 - sciencedaily.com/releases/2... 	1	1	Any|good|news|?|-|Parkinson's|Movement|-|HealthUnlocked	Any|good|news|?|-|Parkinson's|Movement|-|HealthUnlocked|.|My|good|news|is|that|topical|magnesium|oil|is|a|very|effective|pain|reliever|-|thanks|to|easilly|for|putting|me|on|to|it|.|I|also|just|tried|a|bottled|alkaline|water|brand|that|seems|really|effective|.|How|does|it|work|?|I'm|not|sure|.|While|I|don't|put|much|stock|into|the|ionizing|thing|(|the|ionization|shouldn't|last|but|a|few|seconds|when|exposed|to|air|)|,|the|product|also|contains|potassium|bicarbonate|,|calcium|chloride|and|magnesium|chloride|.|The|potassium|bicarbonate|is|what|is|going|to|maintain|alkalinity|in|the|solution|.|There's|been|some|interesting|work|on|sodium|bicarbonate|[|1|]|in|water|for|reducing|inflammation|;|potassium|bicarbonate|ought|to|work|similarly|,|minus|the|extra|sodium|.|Excess|sodium|consumption|can|encourage|some|types|of|autoimmune|problems|[|2|]|,|whereas|increasing|potassium|consumption|may|diminish|them|[|3|]|.|It's|also|possible|that|the|magnesium|chloride|might|be|a|better|oral|form|of|magnesium|for|me|that|the|others|I've|tried|so|far|(|citrate|,|glycinate|,|taurate|,|malate|-|threonate|is|still|on|the|Amazon|list|)|.|Yes|,|it|can|cause|loose|stools|if|too|much|is|consumed|at|once|.|1|-|sciencedaily.com/releases/2|...

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4712324080719402080/Serious-Weight-Loss-with-Issues	Serious Weight Loss with Issues	Hi @CurlyWurlyGirl, I’m really sorry to hear that your father has been experiencing so many health complications alongside his Parkinson’s, I’m sure that this must be hard for you and your family. As @Gerrard has mentioned, bowel issues are quite common with people that have Parkinson’s and we cover this at great lengths on our website here - https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/bladder-and-bowel-problems. Given that your father has already seen a dietician and his GP has prescribed medication for his bowel issues, if he is not seeing any improvements, I would definitely recommend that he raises this with his GP again or a Parkinson’s nurse. They may have to prescribe alternative medication and can offer your father more support on this. If you haven’t done so already, you can speak to a local adviser or one of advisers via our helpline for more information and advice on your dad’s condition. They can also provide emotional support to you as I’m sure this has had an impact on your emotional health which would be understandable. Please feel free to give us a call on 0808 800 0303 or search for a local adviser via this link, https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/helpline-and-local-advisers.

An evaluation by a cardiologist ruled out cardiac disease. The problem lasted about two months and now happens only once in a while. My hart rate has increased and my blood pressure decreased - a side effect of PD meds. I find that I experience a greater since of anxiety in the mornings. .25 of Xanax helps me stay relaxed. Slow, deep breathing and alternate nostril breathing helps tremendously. Physical exercises are outstanding for dealing with Parkinson's. Also, be observant of how protein ingestion affects your meds; this is a big issue for me. Good Luck. 	1	1	Panic|Attacks|or|Something|Else|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715494582949402271/Panic-Attacks-or-Something-Else?	Panic Attacks or Something Else?	I'm a 40 year old male diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease initially in May 2015 and then confirmed with DAT scan in Jan 2016. I'm currently on Stalevo 200 4x per day, Rasagiline 1mg &amp; Sinemet ER 50-200 1x per night. I also typically take 0.5mg of Lorazepam to help me sleep at night. Without it I tend to wake up with stiffness in my left leg (although the Sinemet ER has helped reduce this problem). I'm still working full time, and Parkinson's really hasn't impacted that part of my life at all until about 2 weeks ago. I travel 40 to 50% of the time so am very accustomed to that. But 2 weeks ago I quickly developed shortness of breath, chest tightness, tingling in hands &amp; feet, indigestion, etc. one morning within about 4 to 5 hours. I went to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack, and everything checked out fine (heart ok, lungs ok, no blockages, no clots, bloodwork ok). The EMS suspected it was a panic attack. About a week later I had a repeat of this, again while traveling for business. I knew that my heart &amp; lungs were healthy so I was able to control my breathing &amp; cope with the symptoms that subsided about 5 hours upon initial onset. Since then I've been fine aside from the occasional palpitation. I was able to run 2 miles this morning &amp; put in a quick 30 min of weight training without any real problems. My resting HR can be a little high sometimes (today it is about 80 &amp; climbs to about 90 to 95 when standing), but this usually doesn't bother me. I'm just curious if you've experienced this before in Parkinson's patients, and how is it treated? A mild anti-depressant assuming it is anxiety? The strange part is that I don't feel any more stressed than usual. MY PCP has recommended that I see a cardiologist to rule out autonomic dysfunction, but I haven't booked this appt yet (hopeful that it is just anxiety). I have an appt w/ my neuro in two days so I hope to understand more about what is going on, but am a little concerned. Is there an easy way to distinguish between anxiety/panic attacks &amp; autonomic dysfunction? I've probably done too much reading on the Google. I do have REM sleep disorder too... typically acting out dreams nightly. Thanks in advance for any feedback! 	1	1	Panic|Attacks|or|Something|Else|?

How old were you when symptoms began? My tremor (again believed to be essential) is on both sides. Some days worse than others, sometimes only in my left hand other times in my right or both. If on Xanax it's much better. If I'm under the influence of alcohol its even better. I feel relaxed and then no tremor. Are Xanax and or being I under the influence of alcohol known to diminish PD symptoms? I don't have a resting tremor. However, sometimes, when having one of these flare ups, I twitch as I fall asleep. The twitching can be anywhere on my body. Lastly, what would be considered a low dose levodopa ""test""?

I have read a little on Ashwaghnda and have ordered some to try. My goal is no meds if possible, natural remedies like this moving forward unless I just cannot cope. I don't drink coffee as it makes Tremors worse and will never touch ADHD meds again. As for my self diagnosis and Dr Google. Trust me I have been told this by my Doctor and have taken good breaks from reading a single thing about anything. It absolutely does help my anxiety when I do that however I still have the tremors and sleep loss and will maybe go 2-3 days feeling ""almost normal"" besides slight cognitive impairment, depression and slower moving; then will have a bad energy crash with major anxiety. I feel like this stage of what I am going thru has waves, there are just some days I can barely do anything others almost ok... Which provokes me back to research and calling my doctor. I have been to a lot of appointments to my Primary, GI, Psychologist and even an Oncologist. On top of my other distracting symptoms I originally noticed tremors only when nervous or concentrating awhile back however did just think anxiety. Once they showed up pretty much 24/7 I requested Neurology which is what I should have started with besides maybe a psychiatrist. If I am barking up the wrong tree I genuinely appreciate every word you all give me. I have learned so much about Parkinson's if I end up without a diagnosis I will surely be a lifelong fan of the fight to cure it! I heard from my Neurologist late Friday and the referral was sent to Stanford so I will need to call tomorrow and see how long the wait will be and will surely report back. Thanks again everyone.

That is also referred to as ketoviante-denmark starvation diabetes. Once you introduce carbohydrates into the diet, hyperinsulinemia and blood glucose swings may possibly occur. This is due to the change in the amounts of enzymes in the body. The enzymes that are chiefly affected are the people that are involved in carbohydrates or fats burning. Because the human body had not been fed with carbohydrates, stopping a cyclical ketogenic diet will also imply that the 'down regulation' will be altered. Remaining on the cyclical ketogenic diet will keep your insulin needs in balance. Carbs have always created problems for people with diabetes. 	1	0	Sent|contributions|by|normanr|-|Parkinson-Web-Forum	Another|thing|that|you|ought|to|concentrate|on|is|insulin|resistance|.|That|is|also|referred|to|as|ketoviante-denmark|starvation|diabetes|.|Once|you|introduce|carbohydrates|into|the|diet|,|hyperinsulinemia|and|blood|glucose|swings|may|possibly|occur|.|This|is|due|to|the|change|in|the|amounts|of|enzymes|in|the|body|.|The|enzymes|that|are|chiefly|affected|are|the|people|that|are|involved|in|carbohydrates|or|fats|burning|.|Because|the|human|body|had|not|been|fed|with|carbohydrates|,|stopping|a|cyclical|ketogenic|diet|will|also|imply|that|the|'|down|regulation|'|will|be|altered|.|Remaining|on|the|cyclical|ketogenic|diet|will|keep|your|insulin|needs|in|balance|.|Carbs|have|always|created|problems|for|people|with|diabetes|.

A neurologist known for his research into Parkinson's disease will become the inaugural director of the Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Dr. William T. Dauer, who joins UTSW on July 1, now heads the Morris K. Udall Center of Excellence for Parkinson's Disease Research at the University of Michigan. He also directs the college's Movement Disorders Group and is a professor of neurology and cell and developmental biology. William T. Dauer (UT Southwestern). UTSW's brain institute was established in 2015 with a $36 million donation from the O'Donnell Foundation. Dallas businessman and investor Peter O'Donnell Jr. created the foundation in 1957 with his wife, Edith. The couple has given gifts totaling several hundred million dollars to the University of Texas and related institutions. W.P. Andrew Lee, dean of the UT Southwestern Medical School and executive vice president for academic affairs, praised Dauer's experience as a neurologist and scientist and said he'll be able to accelerate ""fundamental discoveries into cutting-edge treatments for a broad spectrum of brain disorders."" For nearly two decades, Dauer's research has focused on dystonia, a movement disorder marked by disabling and involuntary muscle contractions, and Parkinson's disease. Studies taking place under his direction at the Udall Center are being used to pioneer novel therapies. In 2015, he and another researcher won a grant from the Michael J. Fox Foundation to study drug treatments to reduce falls by people with Parkinson's disease. His research also has earned awards from the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation and Columbia University. ""The personal and societal burden of neurological and psychiatric disease is great and increasing,"" said Dauer, a California native who established a lab at Columbia University in 2001 after completing his residency in neurology. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan Medical School in 2009. The O'Donnell Brain Institute boasts more than 500 neurosurgeons, neurologists, psychiatrists, radiologists and specialists in rehabilitative medicine. By bringing multiple specialties together, its goal is to increase understanding of the brain and improve how neurological and psychiatric disorders are diagnosed and treated. UT Southwestern is building a 12-story addition to its William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital as the brain institute's new home. It's scheduled for completion next year. It'll also break ground this spring on a nine-story tower to expand the institute's research programs. https://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/2019/02/26/ut-southwestern-brain-institute-hires-noted-parkinsons-disease-researcher.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4710391498339525855/Scientists-demonstrate-influence-of-food-odors-on-proteostasis	Scientists demonstrate influence of food odors on proteostasis	Reviewed by Kate Anderton, B.Sc. Feb 20 2019. The smell of food induces a variety of physiological processes in our body. Thus, the production of saliva and digestive enzymes is stimulated before the actual food intake in order to prepare the gastrointestinal tract for the upcoming digestive process. In a healthy organism, this coordination depends on a dynamic balance between formation and degradation of proteins (proteostasis). This plays an important role for the recycling of cells and during the aging process. Scientists of Thorsten Hoppe's lab at CECAD, the Cluster of Excellence for Aging Research at the University of Cologne, have now succeeded in demonstrating the influence of food odors on proteostasis. The experimental investigations were carried out in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans , a fundamental model organism of modern biomedical research. Their finding: two of the 358 neurons that form the nematode nervous system are part of the olfactory system, and thus important for odor perception. The researchers were able to uncover the influence of smelling on the physiology of the digestive tract by investigating the recycling of green fluorescent proteins in the intestine. The brighter the green fluorescent signal within the worms, the more severe the accumulation of cellular waste, strongly correlating with defective protein degradation. The underlying processes are mediated by the regulatory microRNA molecule mir-71. This molecule regulates the genetic programme of olfactory neurons and, afterwards, degradation processes in the digestive tract. However, if this mechanism is blocked, not only are cellular recycling processes diminished, the animal's lifespan is also reduced. In other words, roundworms with a non-functional 'sense of smell' live much shorter - a strong indication for its physiological significance. This mechanism is central for the proper processing of odor signals and mediates adjustments in the intestinal cells. 'We assume that the organism coordinates food intake and effective degradation this way', commented first author Dr. Fabian Finger, who was recently awarded with the Klaus Liebrecht Prize of the UoC for his work. 'The impact of odors at the cellular level is a poorly investigated field', says Thorsten Hoppe. 'It is well known that malfunctions in odor perception are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We will further investigate the influence of the perception of odors on aging-associated disorders such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.'. 	1	0	Scientists|demonstrate|influence|of|food|odors|on|proteostasis	Reviewed|by|Kate|Anderton|,|B.Sc|.|Feb|20|2019|.|The|smell|of|food|induces|a|variety|of|physiological|processes|in|our|body|.|Thus|,|the|production|of|saliva|and|digestive|enzymes|is|stimulated|before|the|actual|food|intake|in|order|to|prepare|the|gastrointestinal|tract|for|the|upcoming|digestive|process|.|In|a|healthy|organism|,|this|coordination|depends|on|a|dynamic|balance|between|formation|and|degradation|of|proteins|(|proteostasis|)|.|This|plays|an|important|role|for|the|recycling|of|cells|and|during|the|aging|process|.|Scientists|of|Thorsten|Hoppe's|lab|at|CECAD|,|the|Cluster|of|Excellence|for|Aging|Research|at|the|University|of|Cologne|,|have|now|succeeded|in|demonstrating|the|influence|of|food|odors|on|proteostasis|.|The|experimental|investigations|were|carried|out|in|the|roundworm|Caenorhabditis|elegans|,|a|fundamental|model|organism|of|modern|biomedical|research|.|Their|finding|:|two|of|the|358|neurons|that|form|the|nematode|nervous|system|are|part|of|the|olfactory|system|,|and|thus|important|for|odor|perception|.|The|researchers|were|able|to|uncover|the|influence|of|smelling|on|the|physiology|of|the|digestive|tract|by|investigating|the|recycling|of|green|fluorescent|proteins|in|the|intestine|.|The|brighter|the|green|fluorescent|signal|within|the|worms|,|the|more|severe|the|accumulation|of|cellular|waste|,|strongly|correlating|with|defective|protein|degradation|.|The|underlying|processes|are|mediated|by|the|regulatory|microRNA|molecule|mir|-|71|.|This|molecule|regulates|the|genetic|programme|of|olfactory|neurons|and|,|afterwards|,|degradation|processes|in|the|digestive|tract|.|However|,|if|this|mechanism|is|blocked|,|not|only|are|cellular|recycling|processes|diminished|,|the|animal's|lifespan|is|also|reduced|.|In|other|words|,|roundworms|with|a|non-functional|'|sense|of|smell|'|live|much|shorter|-|a|strong|indication|for|its|physiological|significance|.|This|mechanism|is|central|for|the|proper|processing|of|odor|signals|and|mediates|adjustments|in|the|intestinal|cells|.|'|We|assume|that|the|organism|coordinates|food|intake|and|effective|degradation|this|way|'|,|commented|first|author|Dr|.|Fabian|Finger|,|who|was|recently|awarded|with|the|Klaus|Liebrecht|Prize|of|the|UoC|for|his|work|.|'|The|impact|of|odors|at|the|cellular|level|is|a|poorly|investigated|field|'|,|says|Thorsten|Hoppe|.|'|It|is|well|known|that|malfunctions|in|odor|perception|are|associated|with|neurodegenerative|diseases|.|We|will|further|investigate|the|influence|of|the|perception|of|odors|on|aging-associated|disorders|such|as|Alzheimer's|or|Parkinson's|disease|.|'|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4709638748961480968/Is-Parkinsons-Disease-a-Bully?	Is Parkinson’s Disease a Bully?	"FEBRUARY 18, 2019 BY ""SHERRI WOODBRIDGE"" We have all heard of them, and many of us, in one way or another, have encountered them. Some of us (hopefully, with regret) have been one. Who am I talking about? Bullies. They intimidate us and physically hurt us. They embarrass us, taunting us with their words. We fear that they’ll defeat us. What do bullies have to do with Parkinson’s disease? Parkinson’s is a bully with a capital “B.” It teases and taunts us, telling us that we are no longer useful. It tries to convince us that we no longer serve any purpose. This disease can tempt us to give up, to surrender to its cruel clutches. Embarrassment is one way Parkinson’s tries to steal our dignity and pride. And it often wins. We forget as we struggle through each day that others don’t understand us: our movements, speech, and forgetfulness. We can take those misunderstandings personally. Drooling, shaking , a quiet voice, and a masked face are symptoms that may have become “natural” to those of us with the disease. But no matter how “natural” these have become, we’re still embarrassed by them because of others’ reactions when we’re out in public. Parkinson’s whispers its ugly lies, saying you are no longer of value. If anything, you have more value. You have developed an empathy that many others don’t possess. You can relate better to those who are battling other diseases, those who are in pain, feel alone, and need hope. People who are fearful receive your undivided attention. Of course, having this disease may not be your preferred method of acquiring such character traits. In a recent documentary video on Facebook, television host and producer Mike Rowe said, “To feel bullied is to feel helpless.” While Parkinson’s disease is a bully with a capital “B,” we don’t need to feel helpless. Instead, we should feel hopeful. Why? We are becoming better and strong enough so we don’t allow Parkinson’s taunting to get the best of us. And for me, that’s a huge plus. ***.

Perhaps your husband does not need medication to help him speak louder. Try doing this:. Sit in your car, in a place not too close to other people. Then tell your husband to shout 'FIRE"" as loud as he can. If he thinks that nobody will hear him he can do that. Having done that, then go back home and ask yourself, ""Why can he shout, and not talk?"" The answer is that talking is controlled by the subconscious brain while shouting s controlled by the conscious brain. The subconscious brain has problems communicating with the rest of the body. The conscious brain is not affected by Pd. You may well ask, ""How can he possibly shout everything, especially with his loud voice?"" He will have to learn how to shout softer. When we shout we can only shout a sentence slowly. That would mean that f he shouted softly it will be slower than speaking. That is better than not being heard!

Under-the-tongue apomorphine , also for ""off"" time, is currently under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For many people, these medications may offer a different and, in some ways, easier route to manage symptoms. But it can be hard to know if and when to add a new drug and what you should ask your doctor. Here, we discuss the new and existing treatments for ""off"" and tips for thinking about newer medications. What is ""off"" time? ""Off"" time is when PD symptoms return between medication doses. Not everyone experiences ""off"" time, but it's more common the longer you have Parkinson's and the longer you take levodopa. ""Off"" time may involve movement problems (tremor, slowness and stiffness) as well as non-movement symptoms (anxiety, sweating, or cloudy or fuzzy thinking). Because each person's Parkinson's is unique, everyone's ""off"" time is unique. ""Off"" time can happen at different times: in the morning, before the first dose of medication; between medication doses or after meals throughout the day; or suddenly and unpredictably. What is the new ""off"" treatment? Acorda's Inbrija is an inhaled form of levodopa, which is the most commonly prescribed Parkinson's drug. In the brain, levodopa turns into the chemical dopamine, which decreases in PD and causes abnormal and uncoordinated movement. Inbrija is absorbed through the lungs, so it is absorbed more quickly than a pill taken by mouth. Inbrija is to be used as needed, up to five times per day, to rapidly reverse ""off"" symptoms. You take it in addition to regularly scheduled Parkinson's medications. This is similar to asthma treatment, where a person may take a daily medication to control breathing and use a rescue inhaler if sudden problems arise. In clinical trials, Inbrija started to work in as little as 10 minutes and lasted up to an hour. The most common potential side effects of Inbrija include nausea, cough, upper respiratory infection, or changes in saliva or spit color. Should I take Inbrija? If you have recurring or sporadic ""off"" times, you may want to consider Inbrija. But because this is an add-on medication, it may be helpful to first ensure your current treatment is working as well as it can. Adjustments to how and when you take your medications could lessen ""off"" time. For some people, separating levodopa from high-protein meals (meat, fish, nuts or beans, for example) by 30 to 60 minutes may ease symptoms. Levodopa and dietary protein are absorbed in the same part of the gut. When you take medication and protein at the same time, less medication may be absorbed, potentially leading to ""off"" time. Changing your medication's dose or timing also may help. If your symptoms start to return gradually about an hour before every levodopa dose, for example, your doctor may recommend you take it more often or increase the dose, or add a longer-acting PD drug to prevent ""wearing off."" If you still have ""off"" time despite dietary and medication adjustments, Inbrija may be an option. Even for those whose symptoms are fairly well controlled, it may be good to have a rescue therapy on hand just in case ""off"" time comes on at an unpredictable or inconvenient moment. Isn't Apokyn already available for ""off"" time? Apokyn, injectable apomorphine, has been available since 2004 to use as needed for Parkinson's ""off"" time. Apomorphine mimics the brain chemical dopamine, which decreases in PD. When prescribing Apokyn, doctors typically add medication to prevent nausea and observe your first dose to make sure blood pressure doesn't drop too low. The main side effects are nausea, low blood pressure or dizziness, and sleepiness as well as redness and bruising from the injections. The FDA currently is reviewing a reformulation of this medication -- a strip that dissolves under the tongue, similar to a Listerine breath strip. How do my doctor and I choose the right therapy? When thinking about a new therapy (whether it's new to the market or just new to you), consider which of your symptoms are most bothersome and how they interfere with what you want and need to do. Will the new medication treat these better than your current therapies? Always weigh the potential benefits (such as quick relief of ""off"" time) against the possible side effects (different for each drug) and costs. Other considerations include:. * Success or difficulty with similar drugs. Have you had a good or bad response to a drug that works in the same way? You might have a similar effect with a new drug. For example, if other dopamine agonists caused intolerable nausea or sleepiness, you may want to avoid the Apokyn injection. * Other medications. How might the drug impact your other prescription or over-the-counter medications? Inbrija should not be taken with certain antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications called non-selective MAO-B inhibitors. (These are different than Parkinson's MAO-B inhibitors such as Azilect and selegiline.) Always review medications with your doctor and pharmacist to avoid possible drug interactions. * Medical conditions. How might the drug affect diseases you live with or risk factors you have? Inbrija was not tested in people with asthma or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), so you may want to exercise caution or choose another therapy if you have one of these respiratory diseases. (Clinical trials did not find evidence of significant lung problems with the drug.) Many people also worry about dyskinesia (involuntary, uncontrolled movement), which is a potential risk with higher levodopa doses over longer periods. If you take large doses of levodopa in daily Sinemet or Rytary, for example, talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of adding more. * Delivery method. How do you prefer to take medication? Inbrija is like an asthma inhaler; you breathe the medication into the lungs. Apokyn is like an insulin shot; it's injected under the skin. For some, taking medication through an inhaler is challenging or uncomfortable. Others have a hard time managing injections because their hands are stiff and slow during ""off"" time. Think about what fits your symptoms and your lifestyle and what's most practical for you. If you can't or won't use it, no drug will do you any good at all. What's the bottom line? People respond differently to different medications, and treating Parkinson's can be a bit of trial and error. Talk with your doctor about your symptoms, diet and current medications, new medications, and what's on the horizon so that together you can make an informed decision about your care.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4712680681062691398/Lab-study:-Parkinson's-researchers-test-a-new-approach-against-motor-disorders	Lab study: Parkinson's researchers test a new approach against motor disorders	"Scientists of the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) and the University Medical Center Goettingen (UMG) have been able to alleviate motor disorders in mice that resemble those seen in Parkinson's patients. The rodents were treated with a substance that affects the neurons and immune cells of the brain. If this novel approach proves to be successful in further laboratory studies, it could possibly be tested in clinical trials. The findings are published in the Journal of Neuroscience . In Parkinson's disease, certain neurons in the brain gradually die off. This so-called ""neurodegeneration"" has manifold potential consequences that range from serious digestive disorders to dementia. However, the typical hallmark of Parkinson's disease is motor impairment, as patients suffer from tremor and stiffness of their arms and legs. Although some of these symptoms can be alleviated, current treatments cannot halt the loss of brain cells. Therefore, there is presently no therapy available to slow down or even stop the course of the disease. Immune cells of the brain. The current study not only focused on neurons but also on the immune cells of the brain. The latter (called ""microglia"") act as a protectant against harmful agents and pathogens. However, in Parkinson's disease a chronic inflammation develops. As a result of this persistent immune reaction, the microglia might release metabolites that damage neurons and ultimately cause their death. ""We therefore used an experimental drug that was known to have an anti-inflammatory effect,"" says Prof. Anja Schneider, head of a research group at the DZNE in Bonn. ""This compound is able to penetrate into the microglia and flip a molecular switch that attenuates the inflammatory reaction. The drug has already been tested in clinical studies on humans as a possible remedy for anxiety disorders. Therefore, data on this substance exists that proves its safety and tolerability in humans."" Schneider and colleagues in Bonn and Goettingen investigated the effect of this substance called ""Emapunil"" on mice. These rodents showed movement disorders caused by the loss of neurons in the so-called substantia nigra. This brain area is also affected in Parkinson's patients. Treating the mice with Emapunil alleviated the symptoms. ""Animals that received the drug had a better command of their motion compared to the untreated animals in a control group,"" says Prof. Tiago Outeiro, a researcher at UMG and co-author of the current study. The scientists identified potential causes. ""With our study we were able show that Emapunil has a protective effect on neurons. Different mechanisms appear to be involved"", explains Outeiro. ""This drug acts on the microglia and dampens inflammatory reactions. Basically, this was already known. However, we now discovered that the compound also affects neurons directly. Especially in these cells Emapunil reduces the so-called unfolded protein response. This is a stress reaction that can lead to cell death."" A molecular receptor. From previous investigations it was already known that Emapunil binds to a molecule called TSPO (translocator protein). This receptor is expressed in neurons and microglia. ""Our results suggest that TSPO could basically be a target for drugs against neurodegenerative diseases,"" says Prof. Markus Zweckstetter, a scientist at the DZNE's Goettingen site and at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry. The researchers propose to further investigate involved mechanisms. ""In the lab only partial aspects of Parkinson's disease can be simulated,"" DZNE scientist Schneider says. ""Therefore, we would like to suggest that the current results be tested in further laboratory studies and using other disease models. If acting upon TSPO proves to be successful, this strategy could be tested in clinical studies on Parkinson's disease."" Original publication:. Jing Gong, Eva M. Szego et al.

I think you shall think another way if you want to come closer to the answer. If you look at this page. under Biosynthesis and regulation. you will see that dopamine and adrenaline(=epinephrine), is closely related. So you can get healed of everything that can remove adrenaline, as that is the reason that you have tremor and stiffness due to fight, flight and freeze instinctive stress response. So that is why sport helps, because you use up all the adrenaline if you for ½-2 hours get sweaty. But that will not remove the reasons to why you are producing to much adrenaline, so the next day you are back in to much adrenaline. The reason is that you in your lifetime have had some sort of trauma (psychologically or physically), you maybe not even remember it or you thing that ""everybody has this experience"". When you go around in your daily day a lot of things reminds you about what happened or you have developed a general worried mind. So that is why you freeze in the middle of the street, why your tremor is bigger when you are shopping or doing new things. And there of course are the embarrassment when eating soup with strangers. All these add up and in the end, as you get older and more fragile (might not be the best word) in any way end you have tremor/freeze all the time. I am coaching people and it is not with psychotherapy but other methods and I have two Parkinson persons improving big time. The one the neurologist now are in doubt if he had the Parkinson after all. the other have now reduced his dopamine with more than 50% and he is stepping out of pills fast now. You will not find a lot of studies as no doctor until now believe us. But you will find a lot about stress and Parkinson and you can google old YouTube clip where you see people with shell shock where you are in no doubt that it is severe Parkinson's. the reason why meditation, yoga, mindfulness and Qi Gong helps is because you train your brain to stay in peace not producing adrenaline, but you need persistent work to be better in this way. I could talk for hours about this so please feel free to ask me questions. I am a biologist as well as an coach and therapist so I explain everything from a viewpoint of biology. You can find my youtube chanel where I have started posting about Michael that will soon be free of medicine. will he stop having tremor for ever. No, but while reducing traumas and learning him to stay calm in more and more situations in the end it will only be in a few occasions that he show his sign of stress - the tremor. We have worked through old traumas, worries about work,. performance anxiety, embarrassment and a lot of other stuff, and now he is fully aware about why he one day have the tremor. You are welcome to see my posts.

February 20, 2019. P rofessor Boaz Lerner of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev with new platform for predicting ALS progression which may also help with personalized drug development and clinical trials. Credit: Dani Machlis/BGU. B en-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) has developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) platform for monitoring and predicting progression of neurodegenerative diseases to help identify markers for personalized patient care and improve drug development. The platform, developed by Prof. Boaz Lerner of the BGU Department of Industrial Engineering and Management will initially be used for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ultimately for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases. ""One of the big challenges of designing and managing clinical trials for ALS is that it is a rare disease , and clinical variability makes it hard to identify markers for severity,"" says Prof. ""As a result, after decades of research, there is still no real cure for ALS and several other challenging neurodegenerative diseases , including Alzheimer's. ""Our new technology will more accurately predict disease progression, a crucial ingredient for clinical trials, and better identify the interrelationships between demographics and other measurable factors identified through physical examinations and patient functionality. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes death of motor neurons which control voluntary muscles. This muscle atrophy leads to progressive weakness and paralysis, difficulty speaking, swallowing and breathing. The average survival time for people who are typically diagnosed between ages 40 to 60 is two to five years from onset of symptoms. ALS population heterogeneity complicates research and drug development because of symptom variability at onset, disease progression rates and patterns, and survival statistics. This variability makes it difficult to predict disease progression rate and pattern for individuals. Having a reliable personalized prediction platform could improve patient care and quality of life for many patients and their caregivers. The new AI platform could also improve clinical trial design by identifying markers for various patient sub-populations' treatment. The BGU platform integrates demographic and clinical data with machine learning and data mining algorithms to produce models that can predict the rate and pattern of ALS progression, identify specific lab tests or vital signs, and stratify similar sub-groups from the diverse ALS population. The algorithms, and their ability to predict disease progression , will improve as clinical data is added for each patient.""Now that the algorithms required to produce effective models have been established and evaluated, the funding we received from the Israel Innovation Authority will enable researchers to create a system that patients, physicians, caregivers, pharmaceutical companies , HMOs, and insurers can use on desktop and mobile applications to monitor and predict ALS progression,"" says Itzik Mashiach at BGN Technologies, BGU's technology-transfer company. ""We are now seeking an industry partner to further develop and commercialize this innovative patent-pending technology.""

Mischley, Richard C. Lau, and Rachel D. Bennett. YEAR: 2017. TITLE: Role of Diet and Nutritional Supplements in Parkinson’s Disease Progression. JOURNAL: Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity. The goal of this study is to describe modifiable lifestyle variables associated with reduced rate of Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression. The patient-reported outcomes in PD (PRO-PD) were used as the primary outcome measure, and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess dietary intake. In this cross-sectional analysis, regression analysis was performed on baseline data to identify the nutritional and pharmacological interventions associated with the rate of PD progression. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, and years since diagnosis. 1053 individuals with self-reported idiopathic PD were available for analysis. Foods associated with the reduced rate of PD progression included fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, nuts and seeds, nonfried fish, olive oil, wine, coconut oil, fresh herbs, and spices (P<0.05). Foods associated with more rapid PD progression include canned fruits and vegetables, diet and nondiet soda, fried foods, beef, ice cream, yogurt, and cheese (P<0.05). Nutritional supplements coenzyme Q10 and fish oil were associated with reduced PD progression (P=0.026 and , P=0.019 resp.), and iron supplementation was associated with faster progression (P=0.022). These are the first data to provide evidence that targeted nutrition is associated with the rate of PD progression. LINK: hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2...

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4707770337684246330/Parkinsons-taboos---Parkinson's-Movement---HealthUnlocked	Parkinson’s taboos - Parkinson's Movement - HealthUnlocked	That's an interesting topic that needs to be discussed, I believe. I had episodes of being locked in a stiff, standing, position, where I just couldn't move, couldn't make my muscles move for nearly a minute, and sometimes longer. I would freeze in place. This was before I was diagnosed, and before I saw a movement disorder specialist. One time it happened when I was walking my dog. I stood frozen in place, and my dog patiently waited, for about 20 seconds, or so. Then he pulled on his leash to get me going, but I couldn't respond, so I fell face forward, on the road pavement, and proceeded to have a face implant. The bad part was that I couldn't stop my fall! That was scary. I got a bad hematoma, on my forehead. I lost consciousness for about a minute or so, but my hand stayed clenched to the dog's leash, and he stopped pulling, I guess, after I fell. Blood was coming down from my forehead. So, thankfully, my house was just about 800 ft. away, so I made it home, and my wife took me to the hospital. They did a brain scan and tests. I had blunt force trauma, and a concussion. Along with the hematoma, I ended up with 2 black eyes. I actually didn't get diagnosed till about 2 years later, after we had moved from a small town, with no specialists, to a large city, with a regional medical center, who had movement disorder specialists. Neurologists, and Neurological Pathologists. I was diagnosed and put on Sinemet right away, then, and it has helped a lot. Not everybody gets the freezing episodes, but I sure did. Now, several years later, I'm having problems with numbness, in my face, hands and feet. I feel like a pins and needles sensation that has gradually been getting worse, so that now, it bothers me a lot, after I've used my hands, in the cold, shoveling snow, as an example, for about a half hour a shooting pain that gradually settles down to mild pins and needles. The neurologist has done blood tests on me to rule out everything that it could be, other than Neurological. It could be part of the Parkinson's , but my doctor is still working on that. I initially presented PD with Resting Tremor, cogwheel rigidity, muscle stiffness, and ataxic-type gait. Another problem that I have is a little trouble swallowing, so I have to be careful that I chew food well, and there is some types of food that used to be easy for me, but now I would choke on them, a little, so I really have to take my time chewing and eating. Eating beef briscuit, dinner rolls, steak, cake, are examples of food that is difficult for me to swallow. I always have water to drink when I eat. Constipation has become a problem for me, having PD, also. I take Metamucil, and bran to help, but, for sure, my entire digestive system is slower with having PD. Well, I think I've rattled on and on enough, so I hope some of this, is what you were looking for. I do think that many people don't realize, that PD can affect the body's autonomic system, as well as the motor system.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4707432311044698096/In-monogenic-Parkinson's-disease,-mutation-predicts-DBS-outcomes	In monogenic Parkinson's disease, mutation predicts DBS outcomes	"Reuters Health News |. February 12, 2019. I n patients with monogenic Parkinson's disease (PD), outcomes of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) vary depending on the genetic mutation involved, researchers say. ""A pre-surgical screening of genes commonly associated with PD, such as LRRK2 , GBA , PRKN , PINK1 , and SNCA , might provide valuable information on the anticipated STN-DBS clinical benefit,"" Dr. Aristide Merola of the University of Cincinnati in Ohio said in an email to Reuters Health. Dr. Merola and colleagues conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 studies involving a total of 518 patients, including 135 patients with the most common forms of monogenic PD. The research team analyzed post-treatment changes in scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS-III), and in levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD). Outcomes also included activities of daily living (UPDRS-II), motor complications (UPDRS-IV), and cognitive function. As reported online February 1 in JAMA Network Open , after STN-DB, the UPDRS-III score improved by 46% in LRRK2 patients, 49% in those with a GBA mutation, 43% in those with PRKN , and 53% in idiopathic PD. The LEDD was reduced by 61% in those with LRRK2 mutations, 22% in GBA , 61% in PRKN , and 55% in idiopathic PD. Further, carriers of PRKN mutations showed sustained improvements in UPDRS-II and UPDRS-IV, whereas LRRK2 mutation carriers had sustained improvements only in UPDRS-IV. Carriers of the GBA mutation showed worse post-surgical cognitive and functional performance. ""It remains unclear whether this finding is associated with the surgical treatment or with a faster cognitive decline that is intrinsic to the more aggressive disease subtype,"" Dr. Merola said. Until more robust evidence becomes available, he added, ""we suggest paying particular attention to the neuropsychological evaluation of GBA patients, possibly excluding from the surgical option not only those with dementia but also [those] with mild cognitive deficits."" The findings ""highlight the need for additional studies in the field of PD genetics and raise awareness about the critical importance for a personalized approach to advanced PD therapeutic options,"" he concluded. Dr. Rachel Dolhun, vice president of medical communications at The Michael J. Fox Foundation, told Reuters Health, ""These results add to a growing body of evidence that genetics are at least partly responsible for differences in Parkinson's symptoms, courses, and treatment responses."" ""With DBS, for example, even the most carefully selected candidates can experience widely varied outcomes,"" she said by email. ""Genetic status may be one piece of data to help predict how a person will fare with this treatment."" ""While genetic testing is not a standard part of the clinical evaluation for Parkinson's, many people learn their status through clinical trials or online providers,"" she added. ""Doctors can couple this patient information with research data to inform treatment decisions."" ""Ongoing phase 1 and 2 clinical trials are targeting Parkinson's genetic mutations—specifically, LRRK2 and GBA— with the goal of slowing disease progression, something no current therapy can do,"" she noted. ""If a Parkinson's patient knows their genetic status, they might choose to join one of these trials."" The foundation is funding a registry of people who undergo DBS to identify best practices and improve patient outcomes, she added. Dr. Alessandro Di Rocco, director, Northwell Health's Movement Disorders Program, Great Neck, NY, said by email, ""The finding that individuals harboring specific mutations, such as GBA mutations, have a greater risk for long-term post-surgical complications is a potent argument to obtain detailed genetic information prior to DBS intervention."" ""This is not routinely done,"" he added, ""and clinical guidelines may be developed in the future to add genetic testing prior to surgery. In future clinical trials, defining Parkinson's patients by their genetic mutations may help [us] understand medication response, and personalize and optimize treatment."" Dr. Brian Kopell, Director of the Center for Neuromodulation at Mount Sinai Health System in New York, NY, commented in an email to Reuters Health, ""It is not surprising that linking the genotype of the PD patient with DBS response yields different outcomes. For many years, we have known that a certain type of genetic dystonia, DYT-1, results in far better DBS results than other forms of dystonia."" ""While this particular study is impressive in scope, we should be cautious in making new treatment decisions based on a retrospective meta-analysis,"" he concluded. https://www.mdlinx.com/neurology/top-medical-news/article/2019/02/12/7557003.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4704564449825697233/Insight-into-protein-formation-could-aid-understanding-of-diseases	Insight into protein formation could aid understanding of diseases	"Scientists have shed light on a biological process that helps the production of healthy cells, which may aid understanding of neurological diseases and other conditions. Researchers examined a housekeeping mechanism which removes faulty proteins as they form. This process, which is common to many living things, removes damaged proteins, preventing their accumulation in cells, tissues and organs. An improved understanding of how flaws can occur in protein production could help explain other diseases, including some forms of anaemia and growth retardation. Scientists from the University of Edinburgh used the simple model organism yeast to look at how proteins are produced. During this process, genetic information encoded in the DNA is first copied into a related molecule called RNA and then used to produce proteins. The team concentrated on a part of this mechanism that removes proteins that become stalled part way through their formation. This clears the way for further proteins to be produced. Scientists studied a yeast protein known as Hel2, using UV light to identify where this protein touches molecules involved in protein production. These interactions help Hel2 identify flaws in protein formation. When researchers removed the parts of Hel2 in direct contact, this prevented the destruction of faulty proteins, showing that these contacts are important for the mechanism. Partly formed proteins can not only be dysfunctional but may be toxic, for example when they form protein clumps resembling those associated with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. The study, published in Nature Communications , was supported by the European Molecular Biology Organisation and Wellcome. Dr Marie-Luise Winz, of the University of Edinburgh's School of Biological Sciences, who led the study, said: ""The process of removing stalled proteins during production is found throughout nature, so we know that it is of fundamental importance to life. Greater knowledge of how this occurs could potentially aid progress in the understanding of many diseases.""

Hi Londoner I was diagnosed in 2004 when I was 53 and it came as a big shock and it was a while before I could accept it. For the first 7/8 years it did not affect me too badly but as I get older I find that every ailment I get makes the recovery harder and I am that little bid worse afterwards. The illness is progressing faster now and it is very variable. I have good support and most of the time I am able to come to terms with my limitations. Sometimes however when I have the bowel problems, Insomnia and sore joints and can hardly walk I get very down and depressed. However I have recently also had panic attacks and am trying to overcome these. It is easy to say but those of us who have PD just need to take a day at a time and make the best of what we can do rather than regret the things we can't. I take a lot of medication but mainly stalevo and slow release pramipexole. 	1	1	Anyone|had|Parkinsons|for|more|than|11|years|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4703162696229656219/The-search-for-environmental-causes-of-Parkinson's-disease-moves-forward	The search for environmental causes of Parkinson's disease moves forward	"Amsterdam, NL, January 31, 2019 - Environmental factors are widely believed to play a key role in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD), but little is known about specific environmental triggers. Writing in the Journal of Parkinson's Disease , scientists review novel research hypotheses and approaches that may help better define the role of environment in the development of PD, especially before a diagnosis can be made based on the characteristic motor dysfunction for which PD is known. PD is a slowly progressive disorder that affects movement, muscle control, and balance. Despite recent success in unveiling the genetic basis of late-onset sporadic PD, genetic findings may only explain a small portion of cases and cannot be easily extended to disease prevention. ""The greatest risk factors for PD are likely environmental and not genetic,"" stated Honglei Chen, MD, PhD, of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA, and Beate Ritz, MD, PhD, of the Departments of Epidemiology, Environmental Health Sciences, and Neurology, Fielding School of Public Health, and Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, CA, USA. ""Yet we know relatively little about environmental causes or triggers of PD onset and progression. Identifying these and defining ways to reduce their impact will be great research challenges for the coming two decades."" Late-onset sporadic PD takes decades to develop, and by the time of diagnosis, some of the neurodegenerative changes are too advanced to slow down, stop, or reverse. On the other hand, environmental factors that cause or trigger its development and modify its progression may come into play during the ""prodromal phase,"" decades before specific signs and symptoms develop. ""This prodromal stage is of major interest for prevention efforts,"" explained the authors. ""Targeting factors that enter the body via the nose or gut has become even more important since the discovery that the alpha-synuclein protein-related Lewy pathology, which is characteristic of PD, was identified in the nervous systems of the olfactory pathway and the digestive tract."" During the past two decades, scientists have identified over a dozen environmental factors associated with the risk of developing PD, including pesticide exposures and traumatic brain injury. Other environmental exposures that have been noted as potential risk factors include organic solvents, high-temperature cooked meats and heterocyclic amines, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, and inflammation in general. There are also reports on inverse associations between PD and smoking, coffee consumption, vigorous exercise, ibuprofen use, and plasma urate. The authors review the current research, suggest future directions and discuss the potential of novel tools and theoretical frameworks for scientists to design future studies, such as gene-environment interaction and epigenetic approaches. The Braak hypothesis presents a unique hypothetical framework for PD development that allows scientists to better conceptualize different steps in the pathogenesis of the PD prodrome and manifest PD. This can also help define the contributions of environmental factors to the different stages of the pathogenic process. The Braak hypothesis states that PD is caused by a pathogen that enters the body via the nasal cavity and subsequently is swallowed and reaches the gut, initiating Lewy pathology in the nose and the digestive tract. According to this hypothesis, PD Lewy pathology develops in six sequential stages, starting in the olfactory bulb or enteric nerves (or both), years if not decades, before spreading to dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra in the brainstem. Another concept described by the authors is the exposome, which represents the totality of human environmental exposures over an individual's lifetime. The authors propose that, together with the Braak hypothesis, the exposome concept provides a theoretical framework for scientists to design future studies to decipher the environmental causes of PD and to develop early interventions that halt its progression to the characteristic motor and non-motor dysfunction in PD. ""We are at an exciting moment to unveil environmental contributions to PD development and progression by taking a life-course approach, considering prodromal stages of PD, and utilizing novel tools to assess environmental exposures,"" commented Dr. Chen and Dr. Ritz. ""The lifelong contributions of environmental factors to PD are difficult to characterize because of the decades-long prodromal stage of the disease and the difficulty in assessing environmental exposures during this stage.

ABOUT THIS SUPPLEMENT TO THE JOURNAL OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE. The Journal of Parkinson's Disease published a special issue in 2017 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of James Parkinson's ""Essay on the Shaking Palsy,"" and we highlighted eight of the most important advances in Parkinson's research over the past 60 years. As we were working on that special issue, we commented on how the pace of Parkinson's research has accelerated remarkably. We speculated that there would be more advances in the treatment and care of Parkinson's disease during the coming 20 years than were evident during the preceding 200 years. Thus, the idea of a collection of short, forward-looking, and visionary articles was born. Eventually, we identified 19 topics for articles, and we are very excited about the outcome. In 1964 Bob Dylan sang ""The Times They Are a-Changin';"" this special supplement clearly shows that the field of Parkinson's is no exception.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702755873777678932/Dr.-Costantini---Parkinson's-Movement---HealthUnlocked	Dr. Costantini - Parkinson's Movement - HealthUnlocked	Dear all,. There are a few updates about Dr. Costantini's condition and future, but before I jump into that I need to apologize on behalf of our group for not being able to keep up with all the requests of help received via email and through the website. This is due to the obvious constraints you all can imagine we have now that Dr. Costantini is recovering and unable to work, though since our priority is to help the patients we need to manage our time, resources and energy strategically. Dr. Costantini's recovery continues positively. Sadly though, the stroke has damaged some areas of his brain causing movement impediments. Unfortunately, these are severe but luckily the rehabilitation center that is hosting him is very well equipped to provide him with the best cures and therapies available. This however, means that for a considerable amount of time, likely many months, he will not be able to get back at work and definitely no longer take over the huge amount of consultancy work he used to do, sometimes for even 14 working hours/day. This is why we are channeling our - now even more limited - resources to guarantee the continuation of the experience with the HDT protocol, and to support PwP who have not taken B1 yet or are unsure about the right dose with this therapy. Thanks to the invaluable help of a member of this forum, we managed to get in touch with the Michael J. Fox Foundation recently who informed us about publicly available funding opportunities for the research on PD. We are going to put all of our efforts into preparing the best funding proposal possible to make the most out of the limited resources and time availability we have now. The goal is to invest our time, including (if possible/appropriate) Dr. Costantini's time, to develop this proposal which will involve the clinical trial of the HDT protocol on a multi-location, international basis. To this end we intend to partner with research centers across the United States, Europe and elsewhere (compatibly with the requirements of the call for proposals) and supervise and carry out the clinical trial. In this way, patients will be given the opportunity to test the HDT protocol but instead of having the entire burden on our emailboxes, there will be other Neurologists and Practitioners that will be able to follow the treatment with Vitamin B1 in person rather than remotely. If funded, the trial and its results would be able to inform on the effectiveness of the HDT protocol, and if said results as we hope will be positive, they will allow other patients after our activity is concluded to try the HDT therapy in those research centers worldwide. This could happen without our direct involvement, which we could never offer given the magnitude and the number of requests we receive. I will keep you posted on the next steps and if anyone is interested in being part of the trial you might contribute to the research as well as have the opportunity to test the HDT protocol for yourself, under direct, in-person medical supervision. Wish me and Dr. Costantini luck. 	1	1	Dr|.|Costantini|-|Parkinson's|Movement|-|HealthUnlocked	Dear|all|,|.|There|are|a|few|updates|about|Dr|.|Costantini's|condition|and|future|,|but|before|I|jump|into|that|I|need|to|apologize|on|behalf|of|our|group|for|not|being|able|to|keep|up|with|all|the|requests|of|help|received|via|email|and|through|the|website|.|This|is|due|to|the|obvious|constraints|you|all|can|imagine|we|have|now|that|Dr|.|Costantini|is|recovering|and|unable|to|work|,|though|since|our|priority|is|to|help|the|patients|we|need|to|manage|our|time|,|resources|and|energy|strategically|.|Dr|.|Costantini's|recovery|continues|positively|.|Sadly|though|,|the|stroke|has|damaged|some|areas|of|his|brain|causing|movement|impediments|.|Unfortunately|,|these|are|severe|but|luckily|the|rehabilitation|center|that|is|hosting|him|is|very|well|equipped|to|provide|him|with|the|best|cures|and|therapies|available|.|This|however|,|means|that|for|a|considerable|amount|of|time|,|likely|many|months|,|he|will|not|be|able|to|get|back|at|work|and|definitely|no|longer|take|over|the|huge|amount|of|consultancy|work|he|used|to|do|,|sometimes|for|even|14|working|hours|/|day|.|This|is|why|we|are|channeling|our|-|now|even|more|limited|-|resources|to|guarantee|the|continuation|of|the|experience|with|the|HDT|protocol|,|and|to|support|PwP|who|have|not|taken|B1|yet|or|are|unsure|about|the|right|dose|with|this|therapy|.|Thanks|to|the|invaluable|help|of|a|member|of|this|forum|,|we|managed|to|get|in|touch|with|the|Michael|J|.|Fox|Foundation|recently|who|informed|us|about|publicly|available|funding|opportunities|for|the|research|on|PD|.|We|are|going|to|put|all|of|our|efforts|into|preparing|the|best|funding|proposal|possible|to|make|the|most|out|of|the|limited|resources|and|time|availability|we|have|now|.|The|goal|is|to|invest|our|time|,|including|(|if|possible|/|appropriate|)|Dr|.|Costantini's|time|,|to|develop|this|proposal|which|will|involve|the|clinical|trial|of|the|HDT|protocol|on|a|multi-location|,|international|basis|.|To|this|end|we|intend|to|partner|with|research|centers|across|the|United|States|,|Europe|and|elsewhere|(|compatibly|with|the|requirements|of|the|call|for|proposals|)|and|supervise|and|carry|out|the|clinical|trial|.|In|this|way|,|patients|will|be|given|the|opportunity|to|test|the|HDT|protocol|but|instead|of|having|the|entire|burden|on|our|emailboxes|,|there|will|be|other|Neurologists|and|Practitioners|that|will|be|able|to|follow|the|treatment|with|Vitamin|B1|in|person|rather|than|remotely|.|If|funded|,|the|trial|and|its|results|would|be|able|to|inform|on|the|effectiveness|of|the|HDT|protocol|,|and|if|said|results|as|we|hope|will|be|positive|,|they|will|allow|other|patients|after|our|activity|is|concluded|to|try|the|HDT|therapy|in|those|research|centers|worldwide|.|This|could|happen|without|our|direct|involvement|,|which|we|could|never|offer|given|the|magnitude|and|the|number|of|requests|we|receive|.|I|will|keep|you|posted|on|the|next|steps|and|if|anyone|is|interested|in|being|part|of|the|trial|you|might|contribute|to|the|research|as|well|as|have|the|opportunity|to|test|the|HDT|protocol|for|yourself|,|under|direct|,|in-person|medical|supervision|.|Wish|me|and|Dr|.|Costantini|luck|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702047107675618686/Generic-Drugs:-Inactive-Ingredients---Parkinson's-Movement---HealthUnlocked	Generic Drugs: Inactive Ingredients - Parkinson's Movement - HealthUnlocked	It is with some hesitancy that I write on this topic. My purpose is to inform, not to alarm. The issues I shall discuss are real, but I expect have very small impact on the general community. Please take care not to imagine that everything I say applies to you personally. With these caveats I shall proceed, because these issues have come up twice in other posts and also for me personally. As is my custom I provide my references: 1) my own personal experience, 2) consultations with my personal physician and my druggist, 3) drugs.com drugs.com/inactive/. From other posts:. 1. Disturbing facts (recent) healthunlocked.com/parkinso... … we are now into chasing after sinamet after finding mum deterioration due to, her drug being swapped unbeknown to us! Turns out been giving mum a generic replacement …. and Reply: …There should be no difference between Sinemet and generic…. 2. Carbidopa/Levadopa generics: potency/quality (three years ago). …I personally have experienced taking Carbidopa/Levodopa generics for a few years and felt differences between manufacturers and between batches even by the same makers…. and excellent first Reply: …as far as PD is concerned, Cmax might be the maximum level of levodopa in the blood-stream following a dose. Then, ignoring a number of statistical details, they need to show that these values fall within 80-125% of the original…. My comment: The first reply seems to minimize the distinction between “should be” and “is”. The second reply reveals the alarming range of accepted chemical level of the drug in the bloodstream and indicates that there is no testing of functional distinction and of possible side effects of so-called “inactive ingredients”. I strongly recommend a careful reading of this second reply for those who desire more technical information. My experience: After more than a year of a satisfactory balance between my medications and my PD symptoms, I suddenly went downhill significantly in a period of a week or two. At the advice of my primary care physician I questioned my pharmacist and discovered that the manufacturer of my generic carbidopa/levodopa had changed in my latest prescription. When I insisted that they return to my previous generic manufacturer, my PD symptoms returned to the previous levels in the first day after I changed back to the previous medications. From “drugs.com” drugs.com/inactive/. “Inactive ingredients are components of a drug product that do not increase or affect the therapeutic action of the active ingredient, which is usually the active drug. Inactive ingredients are added during the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products such as tablets, capsules, suppositories, and injections. Inactive ingredients may also be referred to as inert ingredients or excipients, and generally have no pharmacological effect. Examples of inactive ingredients include binding materials (which may be excipients), dyes, preservatives, and flavoring agents. Agents that combine with active ingredients to facilitate drug transport in the body are also considered inactive. (My emphasis). “The FDA approves inactive ingredients that are included in pharmaceutical products. However, not all inactive ingredients are always inactive. Alcohol is one example of an ingredient that may be active or inactive based on the specific formulation of the medication. Patients may have allergic reactions or other adverse effects to inactive ingredients. If a patient has a known allergic reaction to an inactive ingredient, they should check for the ingredient in new prescription or over-the-counter medications or check with their pharmacist. Examples of inactive ingredients that are have been reported to cause reactions in some patients include: sulfites, benzoates, aspartame, saccharin, oleic acid, benzyl alcohol, lactose, soya lecithin, propylene glycol, and sorbitan trioleate.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4700461079812750899/The-Michael-J.-Fox-Foundation-Gets-Results	The Michael J. Fox Foundation Gets Results	“It’s a lousy. 1 disease to have,” said Michael J. Fox. He was speaking, of course, about Parkinson’s disease, which the well-known actor, now 57, has had for nearly half his life. Like most Parkinson’s sufferers, Fox is afflicted with uncontrollable tremors and halting speech, among other symptoms. But he’s has never been one to complain about his illness, and he wasn’t doing so when I spoke to him the other day. He was simply trying to explain to me the importance of a new Parkinson’s medication that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved earlier this month. The drug is called Inbrija, and while it doesn’t cure Parkinson’s, it’s a so-called rescue therapy that will greatly benefit Parkinson’s patients. I’ll explain how shortly. But first I want to note that Inbrija exists only because of the efforts of the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which Fox founded in 2000. What’s more, it’s the first drug to be approved for treatment in which the Fox Foundation played a significant role in both the approach and the funding. I’ve been following the Michael J. Fox Foundation for about a decade. What initially drew me to the foundation’s work was its unusual model. Unlike most disease foundations, its emphasis was not patient advocacy. Rather, its goal was to find a cure for Parkinson’s, a disease that was woefully under-researched before Fox decided to start his foundation. The Michael J. Fox Foundation used its money to invigorate research around Parkinson’s, and to this day that’s where the bulk of its funding goes. Fox’s first chief executive, Debi Brooks, came from Goldman Sachs, not the world of nonprofits. (The current CEO of the Fox Foundation is Todd Sherer, a scientist.) It does not have an endowment because Fox doesn’t want to hold onto money that might be better used searching for a cure. Scientists who receive grants from the foundation have to agree to share their data with other Fox grantees — as well as with other Parkinson’s disease constituents, including the pharmaceutical industry. The foundation holds regular meetings where scientists talk about their work, with pharmaceutical representatives in the audience, asking questions. Over time, the Foundation hired its own in-house scientists, rather than relying on a scientific board that met only occasionally, so it could make quicker funding decisions. Its scientists could also pull together promising ideas where others might not see any connection. And because the foundation had a deep knowledge of the Parkinson’s patient population, it could help scientists get the patients they needed for FDA trials. Brooks, who has never left the foundation — she is now its executive vice chairman — likes to say that one of its main roles is to “de-risk ideas,” giving industry and researchers incentive to pursue them. Although there are a number of foundations that now take this approach, it was highly innovative when Fox started it. When I asked Fox and Brooks if they had this model in mind when they began in 2000, they laughed. “We started out at a more naïve and uninformed place,” said Brooks. “But as we started chipping away at the singular goal of speeding up better treatment to patients, this is how we came to see our role.”. In its 18 years, the foundation has raised — and spent — over $800 million. The scientists who have received Fox Foundation funding have made serious advances toward understanding what causes Parkinson’s. Once a research backwater, Parkinson’s research is now something scientists are eager to be involved in, thanks to the foundation. The Fox Foundation has become the fulcrum on which Parkinson’s research pivots. Fox once thought, naïvely, that with the foundation’s help, scientists would find a cure within 10 years. Now he knows better. For every two steps forward, there has been a step back. This has been especially true in the area of drug development. There have been a number of drugs backed by the foundation that got as far as a Phase II FDA trial … only to be ultimately judged ineffective. Which is why Inbrija is such a milestone — and why, though it took nearly two decades, it offers a validation of the Michael J. Fox Foundation’s hands-on approach. For starters, the biotech startup that developed Inbrija, Civitas Therapeutics, wasn’t even thinking about Parkinson’s when it began in 2009. According to the company’s former chief executive, Glenn Batchelder, it had come up with a technology that made it possible for certain drugs to be breathed in through an asthma-style inhaler. As the company considered possible uses for its innovation, Parkinson's came on its radar after Fox Foundation scientists explained that Parkinson's sufferers had times when their symptoms arose between their normal dosages. Being able to get quick relief via an inhaler -- the same way an asthma sufferer does -- could be could be a godsend. So that is where Civitas decided to focus. Having helped plant the idea, the Fox Foundation backed it up with money. “We were a little company, with very little money,” said Batchelder. Fox seeded it, giving it $1.3 million between 2011 and 2013. As the company’s work progressed, it became part of the foundation’s “ecosystem,” as Batchelder calls it, getting ideas from the foundation, its scientists and others. The drug was so promising that in 2014, Civitas was acquired by Acorda, a larger biotech company, for $525 million. Batchelder wound up being so impressed with the Fox Foundation that he joined the board. Still, helpful as it is, Inbrija doesn’t cure the disease — and that remains the goal. When I asked Fox whether he still thought Parkinson’s was a curable disease, he was adamant that it was. But his timeframe was, alas, more realistic. “It may not be there for me,” he acknowledged. “But I’m absolutely sure we are on a path to answer the questions” about what causes Parkinson’s and how to cure it. Fox will always be best known for his “Back to the Future” films and his other acting roles — that’s only natural. But his most important legacy is the Fox Foundation, the model it created, and the hope it has given to people who have Parkinson’s disease. 1. He used a more pungent word.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4699990003818507105/Our-Parkinson's-Place:-New-skin-test-detects-prion-infection-before-symptoms-appear	Our Parkinson's Place: New skin test detects prion infection before symptoms appear	"January 22, 2019 by Case Western Reserve University. (Left) Staining shows spongiform degeneration. (Right) Staining shows intense misfolded prion protein. Credit: Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. Prions can infect both humans and animals, causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, mad cow disease in cattle, and chronic wasting disease in elk and deer. The infectious, misfolded protein particles often go undetected as they destroy brain tissue, causing memory loss, mobility issues, and ultimately death. Preclinical detection of prions has proven difficult, but new research suggests skin samples hold early signs of prion disease that precede neurologic symptoms. Currently a definitive diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is dependent on the examination of diseased brain tissue obtained at biopsy or autopsy. It has been impossible to detect at the early preclinical stage,"" said Wenquan Zou, MD, Ph.D., associate professor of pathology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. In a ground-breaking study published in Nature Communications , Zou and an international team of researchers successfully used two methods to detect prions in skin samples collected from inoculated rodents. The study provides the first proof-of-concept evidence that readily accessible skin samples could be used to detect prion disease early—before clinical symptoms appear. In the new study, Zou and colleagues successfully detected prions in rodent skin samples as early as two weeks post-infection. They also detected prions in the skin of uninoculated rodents that were housed alongside inoculated cage mates, demonstrating that prion transmission can occur between cohabitating rodents. Prions were detected in skin samples from the inoculated rodents before they showed anyclinical signs of prion disease. The researchers first inoculated the brains of hamsters and humanized transgenic mice with rodent or human prion samples, respectively. Then, they collected skin and brain samples at different time points, and used two different methods to detect disease-associated prion proteins in the tissues. In both hamsters and mice, the researchers detected prions in skin before they could be detected in brain tissue. The researchers concluded that skin prions could serve as a useful biomarker for preclinical diagnosis of prion diseases. The study compared two highly-sensitive prion detection methods: RT-QuIC (real-time quaking-induced conversion) and sPMCA (serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification). ""Both assays were able to efficiently amplify trace amounts of disease-associated prion protein found in the skin tissues of infected animals,"" said the study's first author Zerui Wang, MD, a Ph.D. student from the First Hospital of Jilin University, China, working in the Zou laboratory. The tests use prions in tissue samples as a template and either normal brain tissue or synthetic prion protein as ""building blocks"" to dramatically amplify minute amounts of prions to detectable levels. One of the methods, RT-QuIC, has been used to detect prion particles in symptomatic CJD patients. However, it normally requires invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling that may be contraindicated for certain patients. Additionally, ""The CSF-based prion test results could be uncertain in some cases and not all CSF specimens from patients with prion disease are RT-QuIC positive,"" said Qingzhong Kong, Ph.D., associate professor of pathology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and co-corresponding author on the study. ""Although skin samples may not replace CSF in routine RT-QuIC-based prion disease diagnosis, they may be helpful when prion disease is suspected but CSF is either unavailable or RT-QuIC-negative."" The study results build upon previous work by Zou and colleagues showing that autopsy skin samples from human prion disease patients exhibit prion seeding and infectivity. The next step will be to develop and validate the skin prion tests for clinical use. Said Zou, ""Since the skin is readily accessible and skin biopsy is minimally invasive, detection of skin prions will be very useful for monitoring disease progression and assessing therapeutic efficacy during clinical trials or treatments when prion therapy becomes available in the future."" Zou and Kong were recently awarded a $2.9 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to validate the test methods using human skin samples. They will determine if skin prions could serve as a diagnostic biomarker for CJD or a source of prion transmission. The researchers believe the methods may also be adapted for diagnosis of other diseases involving misfolded proteins.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4698047255887607181/Yeast-model-may-pave-way-for-development-of-novel-therapies-for-metabolic-disorders	Yeast model may pave way for development of novel therapies for metabolic disorders	"Reviewed by James Ives, MPsych Jan 17 2019. There are hundreds of metabolic disorders -- including phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia, maple syrup urine disease and homocystinuria. These disorders lead to congenital diseases that produce a critical enzyme deficiency that interferes with the body's metabolism. The pathologies and symptoms vary among the diseases, but all of them are usually fatal and have no known cure. Most metabolic disorders affect infants. The majority of these diseases currently lack effective treatments and patients must maintain a strict diet, avoiding certain food items that contain substances their bodies cannot break down. Often the proposed solutions, such as bone marrow transplants, are extremely expensive and only partially effective. A new Tel Aviv University study suggests that the role of yeast, the world's most basic eukaryotic unicellular organism, may pave the way for the development of novel, more effective therapies. The research was published in Nature Communications on January 8. ""The same yeast that serves as a basis for the bread we eat and the beer we drink now also serves as an instrumental model of metabolic disorders,"" says Dr. Dana Laor of TAU's George S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences, the lead author of the study conducted in Prof. Ehud Gazit's TAU laboratory. ""Three Nobel Prizes have been awarded to scientists engaging in research related to yeast in the last decade, and it's no wonder. Yeast grows quickly; it's affordable; and it's easily manipulated as a simple unicellular organism,"" Dr. Laor explains. ""Now we, too, have harnessed its properties to gain insight into this devastating group of diseases."" The research is based on previous studies conducted by Prof. Gazit and his colleagues that revealed the role of toxic metabolite accumulation in the pathology of metabolic disorders. ""We have known for a while now that amyloids are linked to severe diseases of the central nervous system, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's,"" Prof. Gazit says. ""Recent experiments conducted in our lab have shown that they characterize genetic metabolic disorders as well. In such disorders, the gene responsible for producing an enzyme, which modifies a particular metabolite, is impaired. ""As a result, large quantities of that metabolite accumulate in the body and cause serious damage,"" he continues. ""While each condition is separately considered as 'rare,' these disorders constitute a major proportion of pediatric genetic diseases."" In the new study, Dr. Laor genetically manipulated yeast cells to produce a toxic accumulation of the metabolite adenine, devising the first in vivo yeast model of a congenital metabolic disease as a result. The innovative platform will allow scientists to screen thousands of drug-like small molecules to identify molecules that could lead to novel therapies, which can then be developed by Big Pharma. ""Our pioneering research may help identify the molecular mechanisms involved in these diseases and thereby help to develop suitable drugs,"" says Dr. Laor. The researchers recently received an investment commitment from the Tel Aviv University Technology Innovation Momentum Fund, which invests in promising breakthrough technologies, to collaborate with the BLAVATNIK CENTER for Drug Discovery to establish an integrated drug discovery platform for metabolic disorders. The fund is run by Ramot, the Business Engagement Center of Tel Aviv University. The researchers also have a patent pending on their yeast model. ""If you can successfully connect the pieces of the puzzle, then you can understand the biology behind a disease,"" Dr. Laor concludes. ""It is critically important to understand the pathways leading to the toxicity caused by metabolite accumulations in order to develop the appropriate therapy. In this case, the lives of thousands of children may be saved and their quality of life significantly improved.""

Sirion Biotech and Denali Therapeutics have agreed to partner on the development of gene therapies for Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. According to the license and collaboration agreement, the two companies will pursue the development of harmless, next-generation adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) able to cross the blood-brain barrier — a semipermeable membrane that protects the brain against the external environment. Besides Parkinson’s, these potential gene therapies will also target Alzheimer’s , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , and other diseases of the central nervous system — brain and spinal cord. “This ground-breaking collaboration will help Denali Therapeutics to increase the availability of protein therapeutics in the brain, and to quickly enter clinical trials with efficient, safe and scalable therapeutic candidates,” Christian Thirion, PhD, Sirion’s founder and CEO, said in a press release . According to Sabine Ott, PhD, Sirion’s vice president of business development and licensing, the company believes that through its partnership with Denali, AAV-based gene therapies can reach the market “in the fastest possible way, providing novel treatment options to many millions of patients.”. Specifically, the aim is to create new and modified AAV capsids (the protein shell of a virus) that are safe and have greater specificity and high efficiency to deliver therapeutic levels of medicines to the brain. AAV vectors are regarded as the most promising gene delivery system for therapies. Sirion’s collaboration with Dirk Grimm, PhD, a professor of viral vector technologies at Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany, will play a key part in the research. “By contributing and harnessing our unique and proprietary expertise in the engineering and high-throughput in vivo screening of AAV capsid libraries, we will significantly accelerate this joint endeavour and increase our chances to realize its pivotal aims,” Grimm said. The main terms of the agreement between Germany-based Sirion and San Francisco-based Denali include development expenses, milestone payments to Sirion, and royalties from future products or therapies. According to Alexander Schuth, Denali’s chief operating officer, the company is “excited to partner with Sirion” and combine its “expertise around the blood-brain barrier and neurodegenerative diseases with Sirion’s leading expertise on viral vectors for gene therapy to enable new treatments for diseases of the brain,” further saying that the partnership will add a new therapeutic modality to the company’s portfolio and is complementary to other programs from Denali. In October 2018, Denali and Centogene announced a collaboration to identify and recruit Parkinson’s patients carrying mutations in the LRRK2 gene for future clinical trials. Mutations in LRRK2 are a well-known genetic cause of Parkinson’s. These patients will participate in trials of Denali’s LRRK2 inhibitor therapy program , which includes DNL201 and DNL151. https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/2019/01/14/sirion-denali-therapeutics-partner-develop-gene-therapies/. 	1	0	Our|Parkinson's|Place|:|Sirion|and|Denali|Collaborating|to|Develop|Gene|Therapies|for|Neurodegenerative|Diseases	JANUARY|14|,|2019|BY|JOSE|MARQUES|LOPES|,|PHD|IN|NEWS|.|Sirion|Biotech|and|Denali|Therapeutics|have|agreed|to|partner|on|the|development|of|gene|therapies|for|Parkinson|’|s|disease|and|other|neurodegenerative|disorders|.|According|to|the|license|and|collaboration|agreement|,|the|two|companies|will|pursue|the|development|of|harmless|,|next-generation|adeno-associated|viral|vectors|(|AAV|)|able|to|cross|the|blood-brain|barrier|—|a|semipermeable|membrane|that|protects|the|brain|against|the|external|environment|.|Besides|Parkinson|’|s|,|these|potential|gene|therapies|will|also|target|Alzheimer|’|s|,|amyotrophic|lateral|sclerosis|,|and|other|diseases|of|the|central|nervous|system|—|brain|and|spinal|cord|.|“|This|ground-breaking|collaboration|will|help|Denali|Therapeutics|to|increase|the|availability|of|protein|therapeutics|in|the|brain|,|and|to|quickly|enter|clinical|trials|with|efficient|,|safe|and|scalable|therapeutic|candidates|,|”|Christian|Thirion|,|PhD|,|Sirion|’|s|founder|and|CEO|,|said|in|a|press|release|.|According|to|Sabine|Ott|,|PhD|,|Sirion|’|s|vice|president|of|business|development|and|licensing|,|the|company|believes|that|through|its|partnership|with|Denali|,|AAV-based|gene|therapies|can|reach|the|market|“|in|the|fastest|possible|way|,|providing|novel|treatment|options|to|many|millions|of|patients|.|”|.|Specifically|,|the|aim|is|to|create|new|and|modified|AAV|capsids|(|the|protein|shell|of|a|virus|)|that|are|safe|and|have|greater|specificity|and|high|efficiency|to|deliver|therapeutic|levels|of|medicines|to|the|brain|.|AAV|vectors|are|regarded|as|the|most|promising|gene|delivery|system|for|therapies|.|Sirion|’|s|collaboration|with|Dirk|Grimm|,|PhD|,|a|professor|of|viral|vector|technologies|at|Heidelberg|University|Hospital|in|Germany|,|will|play|a|key|part|in|the|research|.|“|By|contributing|and|harnessing|our|unique|and|proprietary|expertise|in|the|engineering|and|high-throughput|in|vivo|screening|of|AAV|capsid|libraries|,|we|will|significantly|accelerate|this|joint|endeavour|and|increase|our|chances|to|realize|its|pivotal|aims|,|”|Grimm|said|.|The|main|terms|of|the|agreement|between|Germany-based|Sirion|and|San|Francisco-based|Denali|include|development|expenses|,|milestone|payments|to|Sirion|,|and|royalties|from|future|products|or|therapies|.|According|to|Alexander|Schuth|,|Denali|’|s|chief|operating|officer|,|the|company|is|“|excited|to|partner|with|Sirion|”|and|combine|its|“|expertise|around|the|blood-brain|barrier|and|neurodegenerative|diseases|with|Sirion|’|s|leading|expertise|on|viral|vectors|for|gene|therapy|to|enable|new|treatments|for|diseases|of|the|brain|,|”|further|saying|that|the|partnership|will|add|a|new|therapeutic|modality|to|the|company|’|s|portfolio|and|is|complementary|to|other|programs|from|Denali|.|In|October|2018|,|Denali|and|Centogene|announced|a|collaboration|to|identify|and|recruit|Parkinson|’|s|patients|carrying|mutations|in|the|LRRK|2|gene|for|future|clinical|trials|.|Mutations|in|LRRK|2|are|a|well-known|genetic|cause|of|Parkinson|’|s|.|These|patients|will|participate|in|trials|of|Denali|’|s|LRRK|2|inhibitor|therapy|program|,|which|includes|DNL|201|and|DNL|151|.|https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/2019/01/14/sirion-denali-therapeutics-partner-develop-gene-therapies/|.

Jeff Elias, M.D., a neurosurgeon at the University of Virginia Health System, led clinical trials that demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of focused ultrasound for treating medication-resistant Parkinson's disease. The FDA has now approved the scalpel-free surgery for the condition. Credit: University of Virginia Health Systsm. The federal Food and Drug Administration has approved a new, scalpel-free treatment for tremor in patients with medication-resistant Parkinson's disease. The procedure, called focused ultrasound, allows doctors to perform brain surgery without cutting into the skull. It was shown safe and effective for reducing medication-resistant Parkinson's tremor in clinical trials led by neurosurgeon Jeff Elias, MD, of the University of Virginia School of Medicine. ""We are very excited about this approval,"" Elias said. ""Now, patients with Parkinson's disease will have more options if their symptoms become refractory to medication."" UVA previously led the clinical research that paved the way for FDA approval of the technology for treating essential tremor, a common movement disorder affecting millions of Americans. About Focused Ultrasound. The focused ultrasound technology, manufactured by Insightec, directs sound waves though the skull and into the brain to generate a tiny hot spot, much like a magnifying glass focuses light. By heating tissue in this fashion, doctors can interrupt the faulty brain circuits that cause the uncontrollable shaking associated with Parkinson's. Magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) lets the doctors monitor the location and intensity of the procedure in real time—an important safety feature before they make permanent changes to the brain. While focused ultrasound has been approved for the treatment of medication-resistant Parkinson's tremor, Elias continues to test the technology's potential for treating other symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

My neurologist also stresses importance of consistency of meds. I take 2 capsules Rytary 23.75-95 MG every 4.5 hours beginning at 7.30 a.m. Last dose is supposed to be at bedtime, but I usually need around 9.00-9.30 pm. I have been on Rytary about 1.5 years; better than C/L, which I still supplement with 1/2 tablet between Rytary doses. Rytary works well, but I still have wearing off periods and never last the 5 hours my neurologist originally wanted me to. I am almost 7 years since diagnosis and starting to get some dyskinesia, so some days eliminate one of the 1/2 doses, which helps some. I also take Azilect and 4 mg Neupro patch. My sleep hasn't been good for years; I wake up a lot at night, but at least with Rytary can roll over more easily. I am up between 5.30 and 6.30 a.m. but put off first dose Rytary until 7.30 to stay on consistent dosing. 	1	1	C|/|L|Senimet|,|etc|.|At|bedtime|?|-|Parkinson's|Movement|-|HealthUnlocked	C|/|L|Senimet|,|etc|.|At|bedtime|?|-|Parkinson's|Movement|-|HealthUnlocked|.|My|neurologist|also|stresses|importance|of|consistency|of|meds|.|I|take|2|capsules|Rytary|23.75-|95|MG|every|4.5|hours|beginning|at|7.30|a|.|m|.|Last|dose|is|supposed|to|be|at|bedtime|,|but|I|usually|need|around|9.00-|9.30|pm|.|I|have|been|on|Rytary|about|1.5|years|;|better|than|C|/|L|,|which|I|still|supplement|with|1/2|tablet|between|Rytary|doses|.|Rytary|works|well|,|but|I|still|have|wearing|off|periods|and|never|last|the|5|hours|my|neurologist|originally|wanted|me|to|.|I|am|almost|7|years|since|diagnosis|and|starting|to|get|some|dyskinesia|,|so|some|days|eliminate|one|of|the|1/2|doses|,|which|helps|some|.|I|also|take|Azilect|and|4|mg|Neupro|patch|.|My|sleep|hasn't|been|good|for|years|;|I|wake|up|a|lot|at|night|,|but|at|least|with|Rytary|can|roll|over|more|easily|.|I|am|up|between|5.30|and|6.30|a|.|m|.|but|put|off|first|dose|Rytary|until|7.30|to|stay|on|consistent|dosing|.

ISS Commander Alex Gerst. Photo courtesy of NASA. This weekend, the results of an experiment sponsored by The Michael J. Fox Foundation will return to Earth aboard a SpaceX Dragon rocket. Astronauts conducted the study aboard the International Space Station (ISS). While the work in space is extraordinary, it represents one part of a much larger journey. Sebastian Mathea, PhD, of Goethe University Frankfurt is one of the scientists who designed the experiment. His goal is to grow high-resolution crystals of LRRK2, a protein kinase involved in Parkinson's disease. MJFF: Why are you trying to grow LRRK2 crystals? Sebastian Mathea: If you can grow high-quality crystals, you can then calculate the 3-D structure of the protein. Once you have that, other scientists can use it to do structure-based drug discovery. Right now, LRRK2 inhibitor drugs might hit other kinases as well. They may work, but adverse effects are likely. One of my colleagues in the kinase community modified the Tolstoy quote from Anna Karenina : ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" They said: ""Active kinases are all alike; every inhibited kinase is inhibited in its own way."" With the 3-D structure, we'd like to understand the specific way to inhibit LRRK2. This could reduce side effects and anything else you don't intend a drug to do. MJFF: How do you grow them? SM: I have grown a lot of protein crystals in my career. The process is pretty much trial and error, with many parameters to modify. You're testing hundreds of solutions to find the right one to grow that particular protein crystal. They can take a day or a month to grow. LRRK2 protein is large and complex, which makes it harder to grow. We've tried hundreds of thousands of times over the last six years. MJFF: Why try it in space? SM: Well, I had to either accept that we cannot grow this or go to space. I thought ""If I break it, I break it. If I make it, I make it."" In Earth's orbit, you have zero gravity. And without the force of gravity, proteins can grow bigger. Our collaborator Paul Reichert , who has grown other proteins in space, said, ""Each time I've sent an experiment to space, I've improved the crystals in some way."" MJFF: You tried an experiment aboard the ISS once before. What's different this time? SM: We did send up an experiment last year. Crystals grew but they weren't big enough. We published our results and asked other scientists for suggestions to improve. And the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) helped us. They manage the U.S. National Laboratory on the Space Station. Last time, we put the experiment in two bags and just sent it up. It was all pre-packaged. This time, ISS Commander Alex Gerst conducted the experiment. We were able to watch him pipette in real time, along with CASIS staff here on Earth. He did a test run, too. So we could answer questions and address concerns before he tried it the final time. MJFF: What's next for LRRK2? SM: The samples are scheduled to return to Earth this week. We will retrieve them and see what we have. We could have no crystals, some crystals that are too small, or amazing big crystals. In each case, we will examine the samples and try to learn more. Other investigators on this experiment, Susan Taylor and Andres Leschziner, are also studying the structure of LRRK2 in their labs at UCSD with cryo-electron microscopy . The Fox Foundation is letting us try everything.

The KARMET study says that it was to start last month. They also seem to limit participants to those who have had severe constipation for quite some time. Unfortunately (or fortunately) for me, that problem went away when I began eating much better, exercising, and taking B1. Still, this is exciting because the video explains how their ENT-01 molecule can (hopefully) get all of the αS off of the neurons, possibly bringing them back to health. Did anyone else have trouble understanding his music metaphor? Is he saying that ENT-01 does 2 things: remove the αS and also play this 'music' for the brain? I'm a bit skeptical that this simple molecule from sharks would do both. Or is he projecting ahead to a future advance? Does ENT-01 just remove the αS (which would be huge) or does it also make pretty calming ""music""? Or, maybe, the αS itself is causing an alarm to go off, triggering even more αS? So if the αS goes away, the calming ""music"" will return? So many questions. But the hypothesis that the brain's αS problem begins due to a real or perceived attack on the brain has been around for several years and makes sense to me. I (and many others) had an encounter with tick-borne Lyme disease several months before noticing the first PD symptoms. If correct, then the gut noticed and responded to the threat and sent αS to the brain, the αS (hopefully) dealt with the problem (go team!) but then the brain failed to remove the αS and (I guess) might still be getting more from the gut?

Posted: July 13, 2011. WEDNESDAY, July 13 (HealthDay News) -- People with Parkinson's disease are unable to make quick movements, but virtual reality- and physical reality-based therapies may provide the stimulus needed to help them move faster, new research suggests. In conducting the study, scheduled for publication in the August issue of the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, researchers assigned tasks to two groups of men and women -- one group of Parkinson's patients and another group of age-matched participants without the disease. Each person was asked to reach for and grab a stationary ball as fast as possible. They were also told to catch balls that were visible for only about one second as they rolled down a ramp. These exercises were completed in normal physical reality and using virtual reality. In both types of environments, the Parkinson's group had longer movement time and lower peak velocity (speed) when reaching for the stationary ball than those without the disease. However, the researchers found that movement time was much shorter and peak velocity was higher in the faster cueing conditions. The Parkinson's group also showed more improvement than the control group in movement time and peak velocity when given moving targets. As a result, the people with Parkinson's were able to match the performance of those not suffering from the condition, the study found. ""This study contributes to the field of rehabilitation by providing evidence about how to manipulate task and environmental constraints to improve movement in persons with Parkinson's disease,"" the study's lead investigator, Hui-Ing Ma, of the department of occupational therapy and Institute of Allied Health Sciences at National Cheng Kung University, in Tainan, Taiwan, said in a journal news release. ""Our findings suggest that with an appropriate choice of cueing speed, virtual reality is a promising tool for offering visual motion stimuli to increase movement speed in persons with Parkinson's disease,"" Ma added.

I was diagnosed with Parkinson's in December 2010, but have had symptoms for about ten years. For the last six months or so, I have noticed that my tongue moves constantly in my mouth. It looks OK but feels sore and swollen. Sometimes I feel like I am slurring my words or stumbling over my tongue. For the past two years I've been asking my husband to have his hearing checked and he insists that I talk too softly. Most others hear me fairly well but sometimes ask me to repeat myself. This has caused friction with my husband. Any suggestions? My neurologist tells me I don't need speech therapy and doesn't know what to do about my tongue movements. 	1	1	Constant|tongue|movements|,|lower|speech|volume|.|slurring|words	Constant|tongue|movements|,|lower|speech|volume|.|I|was|diagnosed|with|Parkinson's|in|December|2010|,|but|have|had|symptoms|for|about|ten|years|.|For|the|last|six|months|or|so|,|I|have|noticed|that|my|tongue|moves|constantly|in|my|mouth|.|It|looks|OK|but|feels|sore|and|swollen|.|Sometimes|I|feel|like|I|am|slurring|my|words|or|stumbling|over|my|tongue|.|For|the|past|two|years|I've|been|asking|my|husband|to|have|his|hearing|checked|and|he|insists|that|I|talk|too|softly|.|Most|others|hear|me|fairly|well|but|sometimes|ask|me|to|repeat|myself|.|This|has|caused|friction|with|my|husband|.|Any|suggestions|?|My|neurologist|tells|me|I|don't|need|speech|therapy|and|doesn't|know|what|to|do|about|my|tongue|movements|.

Note the signs and symptoms; most do not apply to you, however :. Possible symptoms associated with A1298C MTHFR mutations:. irritable bowel syndrome. chronic fatigue syndrome. Possible signs associated with A1298C MTHFR Mutations:. elevated ammonia levels. decreased epinephrine and norepinephrine. decreased nitric oxide. elevated blood pressure. Possible conditions associated with A1298C MTHFR mutations:. inflammatory bowel syndrome. Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 1992 Oct;43(2):423-31. Parkinson's disease-like effects of S-adenosyl-L-methionine: effects of L-dopa. Charlton CG, Crowell B Jr. Source. Department of Physiology, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN 37208. The major symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are due to degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway and depletion of dopamine (DA). Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), and melanin pigments are also decreased and acetylcholinergic activity increased. Biochemically, increased methylation can cause the depletion of DA, NE, 5-HT, and melanin pigments and also an increase of acetylcholine; thus, increased methylation can present a biochemical picture that resembles the biochemical changes that occur in PD. During the therapy of PD with L-dopa, it is well known that L-dopa reacts avidly with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the biologic methyl donor, to produce 3-O-methyl-dopa. Correspondingly, L-dopa has been shown to deplete the concentration of SAM, and SAM has been found to induce PD-like motor impairments in rodents; therefore, an excess of SAM-dependent methylation may be associated with Parkinsonism. To further study the effects of methylation, SAM was injected into the lateral ventricle of rats. SAM caused tremors, rigidity, abnormal posture, and dose-related hypokinesia. Doses of 9.38, 50, and 400 nM/rat caused 61.9, 73.4, and 94.8% reduction, respectively, of motor activity. A 200-mg/kg IP dose of L-dopa, given before 50 nM SAM, blocked the SAM-induced hypokinesia. SAM also caused a decrease in TH immunoreactivity, apparent degeneration of TH-containing fibers, loss of neurons, and the accumulation of phagocytic cells in the substantia nigra. These results showed that excess SAM in the brain, probably due to its ability to increase methylation, can induce symptoms that resemble some of the changes that occur in PD. PMID: 1359575 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]. 2) Thalassemia-minor -- fatigue is a symptom; if your H &amp; H are normal, this is likely not the problem, however, if ferritin levels are low this should be explored. 3) Gluten sensitivity - can cause extreme fatigue, brain fog. And, finally -- yes, I do think the vitamin D provided by sunlight could have been helping; and I do hope the doctor will test your blood level, so that you can determine whether it is currently a factor. I'm keeping you in my thoughts, and will post if I - or colleagues -- come up with any new thoughts. 	1	1	Homocysteine|elevation	Tremblenurse|,|colleagues|have|some|suggestions|that|I|think|would|be|good|to|discuss|with|your|physician|,|if|s|/|he|has|not|already|covered|them|:|.|1|)|A1298C|MTHFR|mutation|-|-|This|hasn't|received|a|great|deal|of|attention|medically|,|but|in|view|of|your|elevated|homocysteine|,|fatigue|,|and|recent|diagnosis|of|Parkinson's|disease|,|I|think|it|should|be|ruled|out|.|ons|/|2011/11|/|30|/|.|Note|the|signs|and|symptoms|;|most|do|not|apply|to|you|,|however|:|.|Possible|symptoms|associated|with|A1298C|MTHFR|mutations|:|.|irritable|bowel|syndrome|.|chronic|fatigue|syndrome|.|Possible|signs|associated|with|A1298C|MTHFR|Mutations|:|.|elevated|ammonia|levels|.|decreased|epinephrine|and|norepinephrine|.|decreased|nitric|oxide|.|elevated|blood|pressure|.|Possible|conditions|associated|with|A1298C|MTHFR|mutations|:|.|inflammatory|bowel|syndrome|.|Pharmacol|Biochem|Behav|.|1992|Oct|;|43|(|2|):|423-31|.|Parkinson's|disease-like|effects|of|S-adenosyl-L-methionine|:|effects|of|L-dopa|.|Charlton|CG|,|Crowell|B|Jr|.|Source|.|Department|of|Physiology|,|Meharry|Medical|College|,|Nashville|,|TN|37208|.|The|major|symptoms|of|Parkinson's|disease|(|PD|)|are|due|to|degeneration|of|the|nigrostriatal|pathway|and|depletion|of|dopamine|(|DA|)|.|Tyrosine|hydroxylase|(|TH|)|,|norepinephrine|(|NE|)|,|serotonin|(|5|-|HT|)|,|and|melanin|pigments|are|also|decreased|and|acetylcholinergic|activity|increased|.|Biochemically|,|increased|methylation|can|cause|the|depletion|of|DA|,|NE|,|5|-|HT|,|and|melanin|pigments|and|also|an|increase|of|acetylcholine|;|thus|,|increased|methylation|can|present|a|biochemical|picture|that|resembles|the|biochemical|changes|that|occur|in|PD|.|During|the|therapy|of|PD|with|L-dopa|,|it|is|well|known|that|L-dopa|reacts|avidly|with|S-adenosyl-L-methionine|(|SAM|)|,|the|biologic|methyl|donor|,|to|produce|3|-|O-methyl-dopa|.|Correspondingly|,|L-dopa|has|been|shown|to|deplete|the|concentration|of|SAM|,|and|SAM|has|been|found|to|induce|PD-like|motor|impairments|in|rodents|;|therefore|,|an|excess|of|SAM-dependent|methylation|may|be|associated|with|Parkinsonism|.|To|further|study|the|effects|of|methylation|,|SAM|was|injected|into|the|lateral|ventricle|of|rats|.|SAM|caused|tremors|,|rigidity|,|abnormal|posture|,|and|dose-related|hypokinesia|.|Doses|of|9.38|,|50|,|and|400|nM|/|rat|caused|61.9|,|73.4|,|and|94.8|%|reduction|,|respectively|,|of|motor|activity|.|A|200|-|mg|/|kg|IP|dose|of|L-dopa|,|given|before|50|nM|SAM|,|blocked|the|SAM-induced|hypokinesia|.|SAM|also|caused|a|decrease|in|TH|immunoreactivity|,|apparent|degeneration|of|TH-containing|fibers|,|loss|of|neurons|,|and|the|accumulation|of|phagocytic|cells|in|the|substantia|nigra|.|These|results|showed|that|excess|SAM|in|the|brain|,|probably|due|to|its|ability|to|increase|methylation|,|can|induce|symptoms|that|resemble|some|of|the|changes|that|occur|in|PD|.|PMID|:|1359575|[|PubMed|-|indexed|for|MEDLINE|]|.|2|)|Thalassemia-minor|-|-|fatigue|is|a|symptom|;|if|your|H|&|H|are|normal|,|this|is|likely|not|the|problem|,|however|,|if|ferritin|levels|are|low|this|should|be|explored|.|3|)|Gluten|sensitivity|-|can|cause|extreme|fatigue|,|brain|fog|.|And|,|finally|-|-|yes|,|I|do|think|the|vitamin|D|provided|by|sunlight|could|have|been|helping|;|and|I|do|hope|the|doctor|will|test|your|blood|level|,|so|that|you|can|determine|whether|it|is|currently|a|factor|.|I'm|keeping|you|in|my|thoughts|,|and|will|post|if|I|-|or|colleagues|-|-|come|up|with|any|new|thoughts|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4693739420362350022/Talking-about-it	Talking about it	No, I am not incorrect. Before I lost my medical, I was an airline pilot; Line Check Airman; flew fighters in the Air National Guard; was an ATP, CFII, MEI; and flew airshows with a zero altitude airshow waiver. I understand the FARs (CFRs) better than you will ever know and fully understand the medical implications of having a neurological disease. I have flown under parts 91, 135, and 121. For your review, here is a partial listing of Part 61:. §61.23 Medical certificates: Requirement and duration. (a) Operations requiring a medical certificate. Except as provided in paragraphs ( and © of this section, a person—. (1) Must hold a first-class medical certificate:. (i) When exercising the pilot-in-command privileges of an airline transport pilot certificate;. (ii) When exercising the second-in-command privileges of an airline transport pilot certificate in a flag or supplemental operation in part 121 of this chapter that requires three or more pilots; or. (iii) When serving as a required pilot flightcrew member in an operation conducted under part 121 of this chapter if the pilot has reached his or her 60th birthday. (2) Must hold at least a second class medical certificate when exercising:. (i) Second-in-command privileges of an airline transport pilot certificate in part 121 of this chapter (other than operations specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section); or. (ii) Privileges of a commercial pilot certificate; or. (3) Must hold at least a third-class medical certificate—. (i) When exercising the privileges of a private pilot certificate;. (ii) When exercising the privileges of a recreational pilot certificate;. (iii) When exercising the privileges of a student pilot certificate;. (iv) When exercising the privileges of a flight instructor certificate and acting as the pilot in command;. (v) When exercising the privileges of a flight instructor certificate and serving as a required pilot flight crewmember;. (vi) When taking a practical test in an aircraft for a recreational pilot, private pilot, commercial pilot, or airline transport pilot certificate, or for a flight instructor certificate; or. (vii) When performing the duties as an Examiner in an aircraft when administering a practical test or proficiency check for an airman certificate, rating, or authorization. And that was my point in suggesting that he attempt to get a medical before buying an airplane. Getting a waiver is by no means assured and it would be ridiculous to buy an airplane which he could not fly. Flight engineer? I started out as a flight engineer on the 727 a LONG time ago. The major airlines have all long since done away with airplanes that require flight engineers. Who would she fly as a flight engineer for? Except for a few diesel 10s used for fire fighting or a few antique 747's used by third world countries, who has flight engineers these days? Having Parkinson's is a major barrier to getting a medical and getting a waiver can be a major effort, if it is possible for an individual at all. 	1	1	Talking|about|it	No|,|I|am|not|incorrect|.|Before|I|lost|my|medical|,|I|was|an|airline|pilot|;|Line|Check|Airman|;|flew|fighters|in|the|Air|National|Guard|;|was|an|ATP|,|CFII|,|MEI|;|and|flew|airshows|with|a|zero|altitude|airshow|waiver|.|I|understand|the|FARs|(|CFRs|)|better|than|you|will|ever|know|and|fully|understand|the|medical|implications|of|having|a|neurological|disease|.|I|have|flown|under|parts|91|,|135|,|and|121|.|For|your|review|,|here|is|a|partial|listing|of|Part|61|:|.|§|61.23|Medical|certificates|:|Requirement|and|duration|.|(|a|)|Operations|requiring|a|medical|certificate|.|Except|as|provided|in|paragraphs|(|and|©|of|this|section|,|a|person|—|.|(|1|)|Must|hold|a|first-class|medical|certificate|:|.|(|i|)|When|exercising|the|pilot-in-command|privileges|of|an|airline|transport|pilot|certificate|;|.|(|ii|)|When|exercising|the|second-in-command|privileges|of|an|airline|transport|pilot|certificate|in|a|flag|or|supplemental|operation|in|part|121|of|this|chapter|that|requires|three|or|more|pilots|;|or|.|(|iii|)|When|serving|as|a|required|pilot|flightcrew|member|in|an|operation|conducted|under|part|121|of|this|chapter|if|the|pilot|has|reached|his|or|her|60th|birthday|.|(|2|)|Must|hold|at|least|a|second|class|medical|certificate|when|exercising|:|.|(|i|)|Second-in-command|privileges|of|an|airline|transport|pilot|certificate|in|part|121|of|this|chapter|(|other|than|operations|specified|in|paragraph|(|a|)|(|1|)|(|ii|)|of|this|section|);|or|.|(|ii|)|Privileges|of|a|commercial|pilot|certificate|;|or|.|(|3|)|Must|hold|at|least|a|third-class|medical|certificate|—|.|(|i|)|When|exercising|the|privileges|of|a|private|pilot|certificate|;|.|(|ii|)|When|exercising|the|privileges|of|a|recreational|pilot|certificate|;|.|(|iii|)|When|exercising|the|privileges|of|a|student|pilot|certificate|;|.|(|iv|)|When|exercising|the|privileges|of|a|flight|instructor|certificate|and|acting|as|the|pilot|in|command|;|.|(|v|)|When|exercising|the|privileges|of|a|flight|instructor|certificate|and|serving|as|a|required|pilot|flight|crewmember|;|.|(|vi|)|When|taking|a|practical|test|in|an|aircraft|for|a|recreational|pilot|,|private|pilot|,|commercial|pilot|,|or|airline|transport|pilot|certificate|,|or|for|a|flight|instructor|certificate|;|or|.|(|vii|)|When|performing|the|duties|as|an|Examiner|in|an|aircraft|when|administering|a|practical|test|or|proficiency|check|for|an|airman|certificate|,|rating|,|or|authorization|.|And|that|was|my|point|in|suggesting|that|he|attempt|to|get|a|medical|before|buying|an|airplane|.|Getting|a|waiver|is|by|no|means|assured|and|it|would|be|ridiculous|to|buy|an|airplane|which|he|could|not|fly|.|Flight|engineer|?|I|started|out|as|a|flight|engineer|on|the|727|a|LONG|time|ago|.|The|major|airlines|have|all|long|since|done|away|with|airplanes|that|require|flight|engineers|.|Who|would|she|fly|as|a|flight|engineer|for|?|Except|for|a|few|diesel|10s|used|for|fire|fighting|or|a|few|antique|747|'|s|used|by|third|world|countries|,|who|has|flight|engineers|these|days|?|Having|Parkinson's|is|a|major|barrier|to|getting|a|medical|and|getting|a|waiver|can|be|a|major|effort|,|if|it|is|possible|for|an|individual|at|all|.

So sorry my opinion was only based on my own exp and my ability to function regardless of my obstacles. So like all things PD we all handle it differently I must confess I was approaching 'off' when I took the test. Just retook it now and got a 36 so perhaps a 43 would difficult if that was the best I get when medicated as off periods be subsiquently worse... anyway this was fun to put a score on my PD, so much so I did it twice. How do you get a motor score? And in case I haven't said it enough, I do not pretend to be an expert here, I am very much a begginner here, and anything I say is based on opinion and expierence. I will repeat what I have read and been told at times but normally state my sorce when I do so. Just using this forum as an avenue to get other peoples insight and share my own opinion. Remember opinions are like butt holes we all have them and people rarely care to see someone elses without requesting to first (yes that sounds like an odd request). This said my butt hole on the matter of score is that regardless of what any expert thinks you are only as disabled as you think you are, no matter the score. I went to high school with a young man who was wheel chair bound his entire life, had to use hand padles to drive a car, yes experts deemed him disabled and he used handicap parking and other assistance, but there was nothing I could do that he could not (besides walk) and he could kick my @$$ in a fight if it came down to it. He never let anyone call him disabled or handicapped, and refused help for anything he could do on his own. So with him as an example growing up yeah I believe disability is a state of mind, and not so easily defined by a panel of doctors. That's just my opinion, I could be wrong...

Eggs: Also common in children, both the yolk and the whites of [url=https://healthydietsupplement.com/herpes-blitz-protocol-review/]Herpes Blitz Protocol Review/] eggs can trigger a reaction, but in some cases the egg yolk is less allergenic. Eggs are not only used in foods, but also in skincare products and cosmetics which contain eggs. Most children will outgrow their egg allergy. 6. Soy: Also in the legume family, soy is an allergy that kids are likely to outgrow. Here in the United States, soy is most often found in processed foods, either as soybean oil or soy protein isolate. People with soy allergies may be able to have soy lecithin without issue. 7. Wheat: Wheat allergies are fairly common and typically resolve during childhood. A wheat allergy is different than Celiac disease, where gluten causes the inflammatory reaction. Celiac disease launches a different immune response than other allergens. Actual wheat allergies are uncommon in adults. =https://healthydietsupplement.com/herpes-blitz-protocol-review/. 	1	0	Top|Benefits|of|a|Global|A|?|tlas|for|Allergies|-|Parkinson-Web-Forum	5|.|Eggs|:|Also|common|in|children|,|both|the|yolk|and|the|whites|of|[|url|=|https://healthydietsupplement.com/herpes-blitz-protocol-review/|]|Herpes|Blitz|Protocol|Review|/|]|eggs|can|trigger|a|reaction|,|but|in|some|cases|the|egg|yolk|is|less|allergenic|.|Eggs|are|not|only|used|in|foods|,|but|also|in|skincare|products|and|cosmetics|which|contain|eggs|.|Most|children|will|outgrow|their|egg|allergy|.|6|.|Soy|:|Also|in|the|legume|family|,|soy|is|an|allergy|that|kids|are|likely|to|outgrow|.|Here|in|the|United|States|,|soy|is|most|often|found|in|processed|foods|,|either|as|soybean|oil|or|soy|protein|isolate|.|People|with|soy|allergies|may|be|able|to|have|soy|lecithin|without|issue|.|7|.|Wheat|:|Wheat|allergies|are|fairly|common|and|typically|resolve|during|childhood|.|A|wheat|allergy|is|different|than|Celiac|disease|,|where|gluten|causes|the|inflammatory|reaction|.|Celiac|disease|launches|a|different|immune|response|than|other|allergens|.|Actual|wheat|allergies|are|uncommon|in|adults|.|=|https://healthydietsupplement.com/herpes-blitz-protocol-review/|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4665744183186555593/Parkinson's-Kinetigraph-Provides-Clues-for-Better-Therapy	Parkinson's Kinetigraph Provides Clues for Better Therapy	"Daniel M. Keller, PhD October 17, 2018. Hong Kong — Use of the Parkinson's Kinetigraph (PKG) (Global Kinetics Corp) changed patient management for about one third of a cohort attending a hospital-based movement disorder clinic. The PKG contains an accelerometer that measures activity and motor function and also gives medication dose alerts and records medication use. An open question is whether the added quantitative monitoring from the device produces better treatment outcomes than standard of care alone involving patient diaries, clinical rating scales and observation, and questioning of patients. In keeping with this year's theme of Technology in the Diagnosis, Monitoring, and Management of Movement Disorders at the International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS) 2018, several presentations involved devices such as this one, as well as smart phones or other electronic technology potentially beneficial for patient management. In this study from the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, United Kingdom, patients wore the PKG for 6 to 10 days in the home and while engaged in normal activities. The device recorded information on motor patterns, impulsiveness, periods of sleep, and response to medications. Lead author Shoned Jones, MBBS, told Medscape Medical News that the aim of the study was to see whether adding information from the PKG influenced clinical management of the 70 patients in their cohort. All of the patients had reported severe or worsening symptoms, or their clinicians had asked about next treatment options after an uncertain response to a treatment change. The researchers asked the clinicians managing the patients what their management plan would be before using the PKG and then after PKG results were sent to them. ""It did alter our clinical management in a third of our patients, and the most significant finding is that patients who were not previously being considered for advanced therapies were identified as being candidates, based on the PKG data,"" she said. In addition, patients who were being considered for advanced therapies before using the PKG were subsequently identified as ""potentially having their medications optimized"" after using the PKG. For 80% of the patients, the results from the PKG were consistent with clinical findings. However, it did add further information in the form of data on symptoms, medication compliance, and response to medication. ""So essentially, it's improved our identification of patients that should be referred for therapies while also avoiding some referrals by suggesting medical optimization of therapies,"" Jones noted. If a change in therapy was recommended, it happened without resistance from the patients or their physicians. The median age of the patients (N = 70; n = 40 male) was 72 years (range, 44 - 91 years); the median time since diagnosis was 6.9 years (range, 1 - 24 years). The majority were in modified Hoehn and Yahr stages 2 to 3. The main reason (54%) for requesting PKG was increasing symptoms, followed by wearing off (14%), enhancing clinical confidence (10%), uncontrolled bradykinesia, uncontrolled dyskinesia, or both (7% each), or to assess response to levodopa (1%). PKG results caused a change in clinical management for a total of 24 patients (34%). Medication was titrated for three patients who had been considered for advanced therapies of apomorphine or levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel ( Duopa , AbbVie) before PKG. Six patients were recommended for advanced therapies of apomorphine or deep brain stimulation when such therapies had not been previously considered. In two patients, the PKG found a poor response to therapy and caused clinicians to question the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. In 12 patients (17%), the PKG evaluation differed from the clinical evaluation (see Table). Where the PKG data correlated with the clinical examination, in 18 patients, the PKG yielded additional clinically relevant information: additional symptoms (7/18), questions about compliance (6/18), and medication information (5/18). Table 1. Difference Between PKG Findings and Clinical Evaluation. Clinical Evaluation PKG Evaluation Number of Patients. Wearing off Uncontrolled bradykinesia 5. Uncontrolled dyskinesia Uncontrolled bradykinesia 2. Uncontrolled bradykinesia and dyskinesia Wearing off 1. Uncontrolled bradykinesia and dyskinesia High fluctuations 1. Enhance clinical confidence Medication ineffective 3. Jones described the PKG process. First, a clinician fills out a request form, which is sent to the manufacturer, Global Kinetics Corp (Melbourne, Australia). The company then sends the device to the patient. The patient wears it for a period, sends it back to the company, and within 48 hours, the clinician receives a report. The system is secure, and the company has only anonymized data, because only the clinic has patient codes. Coauthor Consultant Physician Biju Mohamed, also at University Hospital of Wales and St. David's Hospital, said the technology is available internationally. A next step in development will be to make the information available to individual patients so ""the patients themselves can see the graphs, and that then empowers them to have the information to hand."" A potential advantage of the PKG is that in a system with a large patient load, ""it's difficult for us to keep patients' appointments every 6 months, for example, and this would allow us to fill that huge gap wherein we could have virtual clinics instead of the patient having to travel far away to see a specialist."" An important remaining question that this study did not address is whether the additional data and resulting changes to patient management produces better outcomes of treatment and for quality of life. ""Yes. That's the ultimate goal and the next step that we're going to be looking at,"" Jones said. Alberto Espay, MD, of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Ohio, commented to Medscape Medical News that the utility of the PKG ""is in the possibility that we might be getting data in terms of function by patients that we might be relatively insensitive to, number one. And number two, that this is collected in what's referred to as an ecologically valid setting, meaning the patient's home and when the patients are in other circumstances and so forth. So I see that the point here is to try to get data that we think is relevant."" What hasn't been done, he said, is finding out whether further questioning of patients about how they were doing would have produced similarly useful information to improve patients' quality of life. ""This is the problem in general with all studies that are open label and that begin with devices,"" Espay said. There may be a bias in the patient as well as the physician in that they expect the device to yield information that will have a positive outcome for the patient, ""and lo and behold, you demonstrate it, and it begins a self-fulfilling prophecy."" So he stressed the need for control groups for these kinds of studies ""because they are the only way for us to truly claim that they make a difference in terms of patient care."" He proposed that an appropriate control would be a sham device that patients wear, and even further, that the control group should have a different physician, who, knowing that the device is a sham, might ask questions that the first group's physician would not. He said that would be a better test of whether the device yields better actionable information than just an experienced physician asking questions of the patients. There was no commercial funding for the study. Dr Jones and Dr Mohamed have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. Dr Espay has received research support from Great Lakes Neurotechnology and is the chair of the Technology Task Force of the Movement Disorder Society.

Here is a graphical overview of the screening... view more. Credit: Daniel Otzen. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder in the world. PD patients suffer from shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and have difficulties walking. It is neurodegenerative disease and is caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Currently PD cannot be cured or even halted in its development, but symptoms may be treated to some degree. Probably the single most important cause of PD is the aggregation of the natively unfolded protein α-synuclein (αSN). αSN can form both small oligomeric complexes (αSOs) as well as large fibrillary deposits; the αSOs are thought to be the most toxic species. If we can prevent or reduce αSN aggregation we have a good way to halt PD development. So far it has been difficult screen large numbers of compounds to identify potential aggregation inhibitors, since αSN aggregates in a rather irregular and variable fashion; it is also difficult to detect early-stage αSOs. However, in the new screening strategy, the researchers first developed a smart trick to make αSN aggregate in a more predictable way using the ""soap"" molecule sodium dodecyl sulfate. To detect the aggregates, they then used Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a widely used technique for measuring distances within and between molecules. In this way they were able to screen 746,000 compounds for their ability to inhibit αSN aggregation. By sifting through the results, they came up with a collection of structurally diverse, novel small compounds that either prevent (inhibitor) or accelerate (proaggregator) αSN aggregation. The six best inhibitors share a common core structure and these compounds all interact with the first part of αSN, called the N-terminal region. ###.

Brain serotonin is decreased in PD, but reduction in dopamine receptors is more severe. In PD, 5-HTP helps counteract negative effects that l-dopa in Sinemet has on sleep and mood. 5-HTP also improves physical symptoms of PD. ● Nine of 10 people with PD have depression as a reflection of serotonin levels. The lower the level of serotonin, the more severe the depression. Starting 5-HTP at 75 mg and increasing by 25 mg every 3 days until depression was relieved, or up to a maximum of 500 mg/day for 4 months gave impressive results in PD patients on Sinemet. Dosage range for response was only 75 to 125 mg. ● CAUTION: increasing serotonin with 5-HTP in patients not taking Sinemet can worsen symptoms of rigidity. 	1	1	5|-|HTP|in|patients|not|taking|Sinemet|can|worsen|symptoms|of|PD|-|Parkinson's|Movement||	According|to|The|Clinician's|Handbook|of|Natural|Medicine|5|-|Hydroxy-l-tryptophan|(|5|-|HTP|)|is|beneficial|only|if|used|in|combination|with|the|drug|Sinemet|(|a|combination|of|l-dopa|and|decarboxylase|inhibitor|carbidopa|)|.|Brain|serotonin|is|decreased|in|PD|,|but|reduction|in|dopamine|receptors|is|more|severe|.|In|PD|,|5|-|HTP|helps|counteract|negative|effects|that|l-dopa|in|Sinemet|has|on|sleep|and|mood|.|5|-|HTP|also|improves|physical|symptoms|of|PD|.|●|Nine|of|10|people|with|PD|have|depression|as|a|reflection|of|serotonin|levels|.|The|lower|the|level|of|serotonin|,|the|more|severe|the|depression|.|Starting|5|-|HTP|at|75|mg|and|increasing|by|25|mg|every|3|days|until|depression|was|relieved|,|or|up|to|a|maximum|of|500|mg|/|day|for|4|months|gave|impressive|results|in|PD|patients|on|Sinemet|.|Dosage|range|for|response|was|only|75|to|125|mg|.|●|CAUTION|:|increasing|serotonin|with|5|-|HTP|in|patients|not|taking|Sinemet|can|worsen|symptoms|of|rigidity|.
