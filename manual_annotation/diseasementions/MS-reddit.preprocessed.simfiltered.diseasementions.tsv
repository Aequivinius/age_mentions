I'm not even sure if this is MS related but I was wondering if anyone experiences or has experienced pelvic floor spasms. That's what I am assuming I have been experiencing it doesn't happen often, started about 7 months ago. Two (firsts) of the episodes lasted several hours the rest have been anywhere from seconds to minutes. I tried bringing this up to a few doctors while I was in limbo before diagnosis and I was told it sounds like a nonspecific symptom. I just thought that maybe it s related to MS after learning a bit about spasticity. Anyway if anyone has kinda experienced this I'd appreciate any info. Cause it kinda really affects me when it happens like I can't walk or move because pain/discomfort & was curious if it was similar for others. 	1	1	Question|!|!|Pelvic|floor|spasms	Hi|y'all|!|I'm|not|even|sure|if|this|is|MS|related|but|I|was|wondering|if|anyone|experiences|or|has|experienced|pelvic|floor|spasms|.|That's|what|I|am|assuming|I|have|been|experiencing|it|doesn't|happen|often|,|started|about|7|months|ago|.|Two|(|firsts|)|of|the|episodes|lasted|several|hours|the|rest|have|been|anywhere|from|seconds|to|minutes|.|I|tried|bringing|this|up|to|a|few|doctors|while|I|was|in|limbo|before|diagnosis|and|I|was|told|it|sounds|like|a|nonspecific|symptom|.|I|just|thought|that|maybe|it|s|related|to|MS|after|learning|a|bit|about|spasticity|.|Anyway|if|anyone|has|kinda|experienced|this|I'd|appreciate|any|info|.|Cause|it|kinda|really|affects|me|when|it|happens|like|I|can't|walk|or|move|because|pain|/|discomfort|&|was|curious|if|it|was|similar|for|others|.

I just got diagnosed with RRMS after having loss of strength in my entire left leg last December. One of the things I find difficult is that my neurologist refuses to tell me anything about what I can expect in the future.

Right now, I'd like to hear how much time was between your first and second relapse.

I'm still pretty new to this whole MS thing. I was diagnosed in June 2018 and started Tecfidera in Nov. 2018. Soon after starting the meds a lot of my symptoms started to pretty much disappear completely. The pain and weakness in my arms and legs was gone, the tingling and muscle twitches subsided. A couple days ago the symptoms started back up again. It started with some dizziness and now the pain and weakness in my arms and legs has come back. I'm terrified that I'm having a relapse or that my medication just isn't helping anymore. Am I overreacting? Is this just completely normal? Should I contact one of the MS nurses at my clinic or just wait for my next neuro appointment to bring it up at the end of May?

G'day , I am in NZ and going to go see a old family friend of my mother in laws. I will be taking “critical jack “ and “night queen “ cannabis, harvest date is a week away. He's smoked it before, maybe 35yrs ago, just bush weed. I use a DaVinci basic model vape for my completely different issues.(bipolar,adhd) ) So has anyone tried these strains (leafy site) and what was your opinions on them. —Only two known strains that I have available., everything else I wouldn't have 100% of it being what it's meant to be.( though probably is) What about the consumption methods you have used , (he likes a cigarette sometimes), I am very happy with my vape unit, but I don't know much about MS. Wondering if smoking is possible (does MS effect lungs ?), vaporisers being good or bad experiences? Basic BHO or ISO oil could be made as well and then the other home made products like edibles. NZ - illegal in any form currently, CBD has been approved as a medication with doctors prescription. - I looked into it for me and it was going to cost $600-700 a month, which is what I pay for 2oz cannabis, so that's a very expensive prescription. Around 70yrs ,can't get around very easily and is a little bit worried that he would be breaking the law. ♀️ I will sort that out, and eventually he might be arrested if he wants to be. I would be beside him as well. ( 70yrs old, with MS, in a wheelchair, me bouncing off the walls, bloody hilarious, cops wouldn't go anywhere near that) Any help appreciated, remember I'm in NZ. 	1	1	Going|to|see|a|MS|guy|and|wanted|a|opinion|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4725301340571007588/Wait-to-jump-through-diagnosis-hoops-until-I-move?	Wait to jump through diagnosis hoops until I move?	Hi everyone, I've not had a diagnosis yet, though everything has narrowed down my problems to neurological in nature and I'm showing a lot of MS signs (including Lhermitte's sign? Which I was unaware had a name until yesterday). Me seeking help for these flare ups started about 2 years ago when a rheumatologist told me my issue was likely neurological and also diagnosed me with possible EDS which is.. pretty awful. Settling into that diagnosis, I blew off my neuro appointment (I know, I know). I then moved about a year later. Six months ago I went to the ER for vision changes and balance issues. They did a CT, an MRI of the brain and neck, and referred me ASAP to a neurologist. Well, the one they referred to was no longer in my city. I attempted to email and call several others, the only ones I can find in my town and the next city, and got nowhere. I learned there are few doctors for it here and the wait can be very long. This week I'm clearly in a full blown flare of something and every symptom of MS has appeared. It's awful. The thing is, I'm likely moving back to my old state in under 3 months, where my first neurologist (who I blew off) is still listed as a doctor of mine in my online chart, and I can still schedule appointments with him. Would you keep endlessly calling offices to get nowhere for a maximum three months of care or would you wait and return to the first neuro? I know diagnosis takes a while and it's possible this isn't MS (though its suspected), but I do have already having had an MRI of my brain and neck on my side. Can I afford to wait? Or no? 	1	0	Wait|to|jump|through|diagnosis|hoops|until|I|move|?

I haven't noticed any changes. If anything, a few of my symptoms are worse- faituge and brain fog. Has anyone else every experienced this? Especially if you have PPMS, I'd really like to hear about your experiences with Ocrevus. Is it truly a miracle drug? 	1	1	Question|about|Ocrevus|and|PPMS	30|year|old|female|,|diagnosed|last|summer|with|PPMS|.|I've|had|both|half|doses|of|Ocrevus|,|and|I've|been|getting|faituged|more|often|since|then|.|I|see|my|neuro|in|May|,|and|he|seems|to|think|I'll|be|showing|improvement|by|then|.|I|haven't|noticed|any|changes|.|If|anything|,|a|few|of|my|symptoms|are|worse|-|faituge|and|brain|fog|.|Has|anyone|else|every|experienced|this|?|Especially|if|you|have|PPMS|,|I'd|really|like|to|hear|about|your|experiences|with|Ocrevus|.|Is|it|truly|a|miracle|drug|?
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4725021083914951555/Wife-experiencing-concerning-side-effects-with-Ocrevus	Wife experiencing concerning side-effects with Ocrevus	Hello all, My wife has had RRMS for about 15 years. Been through every medication besides gilenya. Tysabri was great for about 4 years until she starting getting weird symptoms and more “MS hugs” to the point where she had to call her Neuro. So she switched to Ocrevus. Her first half dose infusion was last week and it did not go well. Her face turned red and got puffy and her throat almost swelled completely. Luckily the nurse was amazing and immediately gave her an additional 50mg of Benadryl intravenously which worked like a charm. 5 days later, my wife is experiencing pain, fatigue, numbness, and significant depression. Has anybody dealt with this kind of reaction to Ocrevus? How long did the side effects last? I really don't want her to stop the medication because of its proven success with people who have RRMS. Thanks. 	1	1	Wife|experiencing|concerning|side-effects|with|Ocrevus	Hello|all|,|My|wife|has|had|RRMS|for|about|15|years|.|Been|through|every|medication|besides|gilenya|.|Tysabri|was|great|for|about|4|years|until|she|starting|getting|weird|symptoms|and|more|“|MS|hugs|”|to|the|point|where|she|had|to|call|her|Neuro|.|So|she|switched|to|Ocrevus|.|Her|first|half|dose|infusion|was|last|week|and|it|did|not|go|well|.|Her|face|turned|red|and|got|puffy|and|her|throat|almost|swelled|completely|.|Luckily|the|nurse|was|amazing|and|immediately|gave|her|an|additional|50mg|of|Benadryl|intravenously|which|worked|like|a|charm|.|5|days|later|,|my|wife|is|experiencing|pain|,|fatigue|,|numbness|,|and|significant|depression|.|Has|anybody|dealt|with|this|kind|of|reaction|to|Ocrevus|?|How|long|did|the|side|effects|last|?|I|really|don't|want|her|to|stop|the|medication|because|of|its|proven|success|with|people|who|have|RRMS|.|Thanks|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4725081685659552295/Just-got-diagnosed-at-31.	Just got diagnosed at 31.	Hello everyone, i have been lurking on this sub-reddit for a few days now and finally decided to post, made a throw away for it and just taught it would give me some relief to vent.   I apologize if i get to personal on this post but i mean we don't really know each other so i guess its ok. My Symptoms started last summer where i would get intense vertigo in the middle of the night and wake up completely disoriented and just start throwing up to the point i would end up in emergency, they diagnosed me with BPPV at that point but i knew something else was wrong. I smoked cannabis intensively , everyday for the past 6-7 years as a way to cope with my Father having Brain cancer and passing away from it. I experimented in a few natural drugs like Mushrooms every now and then but nothing beyond that or anything considered hard drugs. I taught at first that it was my smoking that was causing the vertigo and for my brain to just feel fried, i would get these electric signals just causing my head to go haywire and would constantly be dizzy specially when i smoked or even had a drink so i completely stopped.   Things got better but i still wasn't feeling a 100%, until i started noticing i was getting weak in my right arm and leg through out the day as i walk walking, i would end up dragging my feet or have my arm give up my grip so i got concerned and booked an appointment with a Neuro. They did an MRI and from the results mentioned it could be MS but need to do more tests, being in Canada the waiting list was taking forever so i decided to speed things up and take a trip to India where i would get the tests fast tracked and get a coherent diagnosis. I have been here for about a week and they did a series of MRI's on my full head/spine and also a SpinalTap and have confirmed it is indeed MS. I have multiple lesions in my brain and a massive on in my spinal cord. They put me on a Steroid injection treatment for the first week and then will taper me off to take Tri-fedra? not sure is thats accurate but its suppose to be the standard for treatment now days and doctors are hopeful i will be back to normal if i continue the treatment. I am relieved that now at least i have a diagnosis instead of being confused as to the hell is actually going on in my body, i have smoked any and all use of narcotics for now and think i will keep a clean streak for the foreseeable future. The thing is i just don't feel like my self anymore, i told my close friends and they are all feeling sorry for me and i really don't want that. My Mother is always stressed about how i am doing and what the future holds for me, thats all find and will pass in time. The thing that got to me the most was that the girl i have been dating for the past year has distanced her self from me after she found out i could possibly have MS and we barely communicate anymore, i just get pitty messages from her every now and then asking how i am doing. This was affected my confidence in how i would be able to approach future relationships, i mean i understand that if you have a partner you want them to be healthy and active so you can have a normal life together so i guess i understand where she is coming from but it just sucks i guess. I took a 2 month sabbatical from my job which is fairly high profile as i am a software consultant but just going through what i have past month i don't even feel like working anymore, i am so dazed half the time just thinking of everything that's going on. not sure if things will be normal again, maybe a new norm will take shape and i will adapt. Life is continuously changing as it is so these sort of things are to be expected. I did a 10 day vipassana course before i came to india to get my full diagnosis and that really did help me cope with this a lot, i have a much more positive outlook on life and am not reacting to negative sensations that i would generally be overwhelmed by. Thank you for your time and wish you all the best in your journey and on your path. May we all be liberated and find happiness. 	1	1	Just|got|diagnosed|at|31|.

I believe it's the common one, relapse and remission? She was given 3 treatment options. Dr suggests she goes the infusion route, however our insurance company wants her to try pill, and injection before they will cover us for the infusion. Dr was super adiment on the infusion and suggested this was the best route for her given her symptoms. Not sure if this is relevant but I believe she has 6 total leisions in brain and spine. Is that bad? Her current symptoms include a bum right foot, cold and tingling, recently had to get glasses. Other than that she reports she is pretty well. We are still in the process of learning about this disease, but the big shocker was the sticker price for these medications. Neurologist said we're in the ballpark of 80-90k per year. We live in Michigan and got our healthcare through the market place. I believe I hear the doc say insurance may cover 40-60 percent of this. I hear you can talk hospital down and you can reach out to the drug companies for some sort of deal? Has anybody had any luck with this? Any chance I misheard the Drs and this won't cost 100k/year? Started this account today, long time user of reddit. Putting this out to reddit universe. Appreciate any help, tips, info or advice.

Seeing an MS Specialist and my insurance might refuse to pay for the visit. Need an idea what this might cost out of pocket.	I made an appointment to see an MS Specialist. I mentioned to my PCP that I would be going to see an MS Specialist at UPMC and I'm pretty sure she'll approve my referral. The real problem is my insurance. Even though this hospital is in-network, my insurance may refuse to pay for the visit. With my tax refund, I'm sitting on a tidy nest egg, so I'm pretty sure I can pay for the visit outright, however I have no clue as to how much this might cost me. My insurance agent will not tell me and the doctors office says I need to ask the insurance agent. (silent screaming) So, I'm hoping you peeps can help me out. Even the vaguest estimates would be great. Have you seen an MS Specialist (in the US) just for a regular visit (no lab work, no MRIs) to talk about MS, continuing care, and treatment strategies? Do you have a rough estimate on how much that might cost? Right now I'm thinking anywhere between $300-$1000 without insurance paying one red cent, but this is just me making wild guesses. 	1	0	Seeing|an|MS|Specialist|and|my|insurance|might|refuse|to|pay|for|the|visit|.|Need|an|idea|what|this|might|cost|out|of|pocket|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4724590691873462620/Chronic-Sinus-Infections-on-Rituxan---Hypogammaglobulinemia--Low-IgG?	Chronic Sinus Infections on Rituxan - Hypogammaglobulinemia / Low IgG?	I've been on Rituxan for a few years now with good results so far, but over the past year I have developed a recurring/never gone away sinus infection that has been quite annoying. I've been on tons of antibiotics, which are not resistant to the bacteria, with no success. I even had sinus surgery a month ago or so followed by 2 round of antibiotics and I still can't shake the infection. I also have had a recurring pink eye issue, and started to get some mucus in the lungs that I can cough up if I try to. I've had sinus infections before Rituxan but never one that a single round of antibiotics wouldn't handle. Enough is enough so I started trying to figure this out on my own and stumbled on a condition called Hypogammaglobulinemia which is effectively low IgG levels. Further research led me to articles that described a connection between Rituximab (and other anti-CD20 treatments) and this condition. Some articles are here: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pmc/articles/PMC5937879/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pmc/articles/PMC5937879/) (Secondary antibody deficiency: a complication of anti-CD20 therapy for neuroinflammation) [https://nn.neurology.org/content/5/6/e498](https://nn.neurology.org/content/5/6/e498) (Rituximab-induced hypogammaglobulinemia in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders) **So question to all of you on Rituximab or Ocrevus:** Has anyone ever experienced something like this before? What did you do about it?

MS disease diagnosis, wife gone in 5 months and my job a month later. I see nothing but darkness. Lost all will to live. What should I do? I am blank.	Hi there, I (29m) can only work part time due to the illness at the moment. Fatigue and nerve pain are monsters. Mobility issues. My wife was brutal (no kids, thankfully), left suddenly with zero contact apart from some issues with our stuff. Ice cold. Seems like she blames me for bringing this on her (its all about her, always) and basically said that she and her girlfriends agreed that she could not feel sorry for losers and of course some other unfair reasons. I miss her too much but I know I could never get back with her after this. I never got the shock until now. Final drops of optimism. Its a scary feeling. I knew this would come. I like life, always been happy but the scary thoughts are taking over. I have tried some medication, meditation, exercises and seeing a shrink. Any thoughts? At least cheer me up ;) I am sorry for feeling sorry for myself :). 	1	1	MS|disease|diagnosis|,|wife|gone|in|5|months|and|my|job|a|month|later|.|I|see|nothing|but|darkness|.|Lost|all|will|to|live|.|What|should|I|do|?|I|am|blank|.

Maybe MS (and autoimmune disorders mpre broadly) are caused during critical moments when the immune system is diminished.	Vitamin D3 is an important immunomodulator gotten from supplements or sun exposure, and viral load is also known to supress the immune system. So maybe the modern life style of staying inside and not getting much sun causes the immune system ti drop but the host is still exposed to viruses and other pathogens the immune ststem has to handle. Maybe while its stessed and has to attack these pathogens it accidentally codes for myelin sheathes or other body tissues to attack. 	1	0	Maybe|MS|(|and|autoimmune|disorders|mpre|broadly|)|are|caused|during|critical|moments|when|the|immune|system|is|diminished|.

I'm really just looking for a little reassurance here because I'm super discouraged. After two weeks and three days of IV steroids, I have no more mobility in my right hand and still can't type or write. Which absolutely SUCKS because I have an English paper due next Tuesday for an instructor who is a notoriously hard grader. And I absolutely can't dictate. Forgetting words and a slow train of thought and all. My MS nurse told me that if nothing has improved after my steroid treatments, this is likely not a typical relapse and is more so just a hard period in my disease. I'm taking baclofen 4 times a day now, sometimes 3 with a flexeril at night, and meloxicam once a day. Because my arm hurts like hell! I'm also trying CBD oil in my water because why not. Has baclofen improved you guys' muscle rigidity and stiffness? Are there any exercises you do that relieve it, maybe?

I (25f) have recently started to realize how much I'd like to know and have friendships with other young people who have MS/are disabled/have a chronic illness. My profession is one where we talk a lot about racial justice, feminism, queer rights etc, and yet I am realizing as much as I advocate for people to embrace their oppressed identities and seek power and solidarity, I have for so long striven to ""pass"" as a neurotypical, able-bodied person. I downplay my disease to my friends and loved ones, hating to feel different and deficient. My illness has always been something that I try to disguise as much as possible. My wonderfully supportive friends look frightened and unsure when they see my body moving in strange and unpredictable ways; they wince with sympathy when I mention in passing the reality that to me is perfectly normal. I struggle to remind myself that I am running on sand and other people my age are running on asphalt. I am tired of feeling ashamed of being tired. I realize I can't expect able-bodied, well people to truly understand what I experience - I need to meet people like me!   All of this is a long way to ask, have you guys had success meeting other people who have MS or disabilities/illnesses like it?

I sure as heck know I am, today I'm walking quite nicely with my walker!!! I guess I'm here 'cause I am scared? Confused? In need of moral support? Want to Vent? ETC ETC I honestly have no idea I feel like i'm writing a diary journal lol But hopefully this will help me kinda idk deal lol I'm Canadian so luckily I have access to a pretty great medical team, I have a great partner who is my strongest ally & support though my family is across the country so even though my bf is amazing and great I do still find myself feeling idk feeling like im dealing with this alone, even though I know I'm not lol I keep finding myself trying to convince myself that I'm faking and that I'm totally okay and that my diagnosis was wrong, even though I know like *deep down* or whatever that it's right and I am trying super hard to kinda like accept that I have RRMS theres evidence supporting it and everything so like obviously I have it, and should be able to come to terms with it. But I still keep finding myself idk in shock or in denial i'm not really sure... I dont know if thats normal or if its because my onset was super sudden (literally started having my first symptom end of January, had my first serious attack in Mid February (severe optic neuritis that i'm still recovering from) then the other attack this month (leg numbness & weakness leading to mobility issues.) . My first brain MRI showed like 15 tiny white matter lesions & at the time we were hoping it was just idiopathic and my second brain MRI a month later showed 2 new lesions etc, my CSpine MRI was clear (WOOO) and my thorasic MRI showed a lesion and hyperintensity (im going to the doctor today will hopefully figure out what the heck that means).   So here I am 24 year old me chilling with an almost blind eye and limited mobility and it kinda feels like the end of the world lol. I am doing my best to have a positive mindset and try to push myself within my physical limits everyday for recovery purposes but its really hard and part of me is still having a hard time believing all this is happening.   I guess I'm asking for any advice/insight How did you manage to beat the heck out of your MS and not let it define you How do you make those hard days just a bit harder   Really any advice or suggestion anyone may have would be super appreciated.

"I'll begin by saying MS sucks more than anything and there's nothing pleasant about it. My heart goes out to anyone who's been diagnosed with this chronic condition. Maybe its a bout of extreme euphoria today, or maybe its because today is Friday; but I felt compelled to write my list of things I'm grateful for as a now 24 y.o. who was diagnosed with MS at 15. \- **Being diagnosed young allowed me to seek out the right help regarding my education and occupations.** Many people who are diagnosed later on may have had to struggle with not knowing what was wrong with them and having their work or education suffer as a result. While this may be true in any scenario, being diagnosed early allowed me to ask for the help when I needed. This set a precedent and taught me how accommodations can be a good thing. \- **Enabled me to be an active participant in MS and genetic research.** Probably the point I'm most excited about! MS and other autoimmune conditions have plagued me of course but also my mom and a good chunk of her family. We are beginning to scratch the surface in learning what triggers MS and how it is linked to genetics. I'm super excited to be able to help with this by educating myself and as an active participant. The more we know means we will be able to educate others on how to make the best decisions for themselves and those around them. \- **Learning that I'm not invisible and that I shouldn't hesitate on doing things.** I was constantly seeing people my age get told they're ""not invisible and they shouldn't act like they are."" Well, the opposite has always been true for me and I'm now beginning to be grateful for it. I knew early on that I wasn't invisible and the unpredictability that comes with MS has pushed me to do the things that I would've hesitated on otherwise. Taking road trips with my friends and pursuing my education and work ethics are some examples of things that I wouldn't have pursued without my MS. \- **Getting diagnosed at a time where MS medication options are plenty.** These may allow me to retain a semblance of normality for as long as possible. So far I consider myself relatively lucky in regards to my illness even though it drives me buggy at times. I know that many medication options exist and unlike many of my relatives; I actually have options that enable me to be more aggressive in treating my MS and I'm grateful to have the options. Hopefully this will allow me to maintain some sense of normality for as long as possible. Certainly better odds than in the past. \- **Most importantly, I know who my real friends are and got to learn it quicker than most.** A disease that's chronic and ravages the body like MS does means that you'll figure out who you can depend on really quick when things go bad. Being diagnosed early on means I was also fortunate enough not to be married or have kids that might be adversely impacted by such a diagnosis. Instead, when/if I choose those things I can make informed decisions regarding that kind of stuff. I cannot imagine what it would be like to have a partner leave me or to have children negatively impacted by such a chronic illness (nor the strength it probably takes to cope with such things). Relationships are tough enough on their own so I'm grateful that I can be upfront about my condition and hopefully find someone who can accept me for who I am (and not my condition). Thanks for reading. Hopefully this can be beneficial to someone; but writing it has made me feel good in and of itself and that's really the only thing that prompted me to write it anyway!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4723306952537282823/Dating-with-MS---rant-about-my-ex-and-a-question	Dating with MS - rant about my ex and a question	I have relapsing MS and was diagnosed October 2018. I was in a long distance relationship with another woman for eleven months, and it started extremely intense and affectionate and I still very much miss her even though I'm also angry and am wrapping my head around the fact that our relationship was also very much not normal (even aside from the long distance of Boston to Vancouver). To console me, my best friend came over to listen to me talk and cry about it, and she told me that as early as a month after my diagnosis, my ex told her that she “wasn't sure if she could emotionally support someone with my diagnosis”. This was also happening at a time when I was texting her regularly and was met with silence from her for days when I was asking for any sort of attention or affection. Of course, she never expressed any of those thoughts or concerns to me. That wound up being a pattern for months, where she would like withhold any sort of attention or conversation and then make it seem like that was an unreasonable expectation in a relationship. I was just always too emotional for her to talk to. She would talk about how she was worried about me and how I needed to build a network of support otherwise, but I already had a network of support and was actively reaching out to friends and family also. I just wanted her to listen and be there for me, because she was my girlfriend. We were supposed to be a team. Is this common? Do people frequently split after a difficult diagnosis? I feel like this relationship made me feel crazy all the time, and I don't have a good concept of what's a reasonable expectation to have of a partner. I feel like when I asked for attention (of any kind—not just regarding MS), I was treated like a nuisance or an inconvenience. I'm scared of dating again after I have some time to process this. I don't know if this is just how people are? My dating pool is already smaller because I'm a lesbian and there's just fewer of us. I'm scared that I won't find anyone because apparently this diagnosis has made me monstrous and unwieldy. 	1	1	Dating|with|MS|-|rant|about|my|ex|and|a|question	I|have|relapsing|MS|and|was|diagnosed|October|2018|.|I|was|in|a|long|distance|relationship|with|another|woman|for|eleven|months|,|and|it|started|extremely|intense|and|affectionate|and|I|still|very|much|miss|her|even|though|I'm|also|angry|and|am|wrapping|my|head|around|the|fact|that|our|relationship|was|also|very|much|not|normal|(|even|aside|from|the|long|distance|of|Boston|to|Vancouver|)|.|To|console|me|,|my|best|friend|came|over|to|listen|to|me|talk|and|cry|about|it|,|and|she|told|me|that|as|early|as|a|month|after|my|diagnosis|,|my|ex|told|her|that|she|“|wasn't|sure|if|she|could|emotionally|support|someone|with|my|diagnosis|”|.|This|was|also|happening|at|a|time|when|I|was|texting|her|regularly|and|was|met|with|silence|from|her|for|days|when|I|was|asking|for|any|sort|of|attention|or|affection|.|Of|course|,|she|never|expressed|any|of|those|thoughts|or|concerns|to|me|.|That|wound|up|being|a|pattern|for|months|,|where|she|would|like|withhold|any|sort|of|attention|or|conversation|and|then|make|it|seem|like|that|was|an|unreasonable|expectation|in|a|relationship|.|I|was|just|always|too|emotional|for|her|to|talk|to|.|She|would|talk|about|how|she|was|worried|about|me|and|how|I|needed|to|build|a|network|of|support|otherwise|,|but|I|already|had|a|network|of|support|and|was|actively|reaching|out|to|friends|and|family|also|.|I|just|wanted|her|to|listen|and|be|there|for|me|,|because|she|was|my|girlfriend|.|We|were|supposed|to|be|a|team|.|Is|this|common|?|Do|people|frequently|split|after|a|difficult|diagnosis|?|I|feel|like|this|relationship|made|me|feel|crazy|all|the|time|,|and|I|don't|have|a|good|concept|of|what's|a|reasonable|expectation|to|have|of|a|partner|.|I|feel|like|when|I|asked|for|attention|(|of|any|kind|—|not|just|regarding|MS|)|,|I|was|treated|like|a|nuisance|or|an|inconvenience|.|I'm|scared|of|dating|again|after|I|have|some|time|to|process|this|.|I|don't|know|if|this|is|just|how|people|are|?|My|dating|pool|is|already|smaller|because|I'm|a|lesbian|and|there's|just|fewer|of|us|.|I'm|scared|that|I|won't|find|anyone|because|apparently|this|diagnosis|has|made|me|monstrous|and|unwieldy|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4723050592380268245/Glatiramer--Headaches?	Glatiramer & Headaches?	I've been taking glatiramer for just a few short weeks now. I was diagnosed last month on February 4th and noticed my optic neuritis starting on January 4th. Prior to all of this I was pretty healthy. I hardly ever got headaches. I seem to have a constant headache now for the past week or so. I did have a headache prior to this which I thought might be from my spinal tap. It went away. Then I decided to cut out caffeine from my life and got the headaches again. I thought this might be from the adjustment and withdrawals. Now I've started my medicine and the headaches are back again. My vision in my left eye has still not healed completely from my optic neuritis. Now I'm left wondering where these headaches are coming from. I don't know if it's because I can't see properly or if it's from my medicine or if this is just flat-out something I'm going to have to deal with for the rest of my life now that I have MS.

Last year about october time, she started having really bad issues with sleeping all the time and struggling to get her words out. At first she went through to the GP and they diagnosed her with depression, signed her off from work and what not and we thought nothing of it - Doctor has said this, lets go with it and see what happens. A few weeks later it's now the opposite in regards to her sleep schedule - She can't sleep at all. Prior to all of this, she was quite a heavy drinker (like 4-5 cans a night?) but now it's gone completely - She has no cravings, no want, nothing for the drink. So we end up taking her to the hospital for some tests as we're pretty confused about such a huge change, on top of her struggling even more than before to even articulate a sentence - Like you know when you're chatting and somebody can't get their words out so you try and help them along? Like that except there was no ""*click*"" moment - Just a determined frown which slowly melted into frustrated exasperation. So she has the MRI/CAT scan - We were having some silly joke over why it was called a ""cat"" scan - ""*Did they have Doctor Puss Puss*"" or someshit. So the consultant comes back after a while and explains that there's a huge white patch on her brain, it's possibly a Tumor - It's been sent off for further assessment. That moment was torture, all the way up until we find out the good/bad news that it is indeed NOT a brain tumor but MS. They give her some steroids to try and reduce the swelling and send her on her way. Fast forward to now - Mentally, she is so much better than she once was, it's insane. Yeah she's not up to how she used to be and we're accepting this, she's doing so well and myself, my sister and my step-father are providing all the support we can - Hell her boss has even come to our house several times and said not to worry about work, come in when you can and leave when you can- It's truly been awe inspiring how much support there has been. I'm just starting to struggle - Each day she seems to be getting slimmer, walking up to the shops, walking up stairs, anything too much knackers her out. The other day i was helping her out with washing and she was putting on bedding and i go to see what she's doing - She's stretching over the bed to tuck the sheet under and on her way back her arms just give way and (fortunately) she falls face first onto the bed. I know it sounds selfish to be moaning and crying about it, but I'm just so scared i still feel like a kid who's really not ready to lose his mum - I know i'm 24 and she's definitely got plenty more years ahead of her, i'm just worried about whats next I guess. Thanks for reading this if you did, feels nice to get it off my chest even just a bit. Keep going strong everyone out there facing this bastard of an issue.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4723050592383462649/Weirdest-MS-symptoms-ever!-Internal-Vibration-+-ear-buzzing	Weirdest MS symptoms ever! Internal Vibration + ear buzzing	So this is the weirdest MS symptom I have ever encountered that made me question my perception/judgment and made me feel crazy af.... I got diagnosed last dec with the typical MS crap numbness, hug, fatigueness, and the occousinal painful muscle spasms which I thought was uncomfortable... turns out it can get alot worse (duh!)..soo Sunday night I thought I was recovering from a flu.. I go to bed ready to sleep and I started feeling like the bed is vibrating..like it was literally hooked up to some vibrating machine or electricity.. fairly intense machine like vibrations that I was feeling in my entire body head to toe...so here I really thought it's the bed! I was feeling super anxious/weird but I tied it to the annoying vibration that I can't figure out where it's coming from... I walked around the house..tried sleeping in a different place... went to the washroom...still felt it everywhere.. I was like losing my mind of why is the house vibrating??.. for some reason I was so sure it's the house not me! Probably because at the same time I started hearing a buzzing sound constantly so I thought thats what's causing the vibrations (like a machine or something)...I downloaded vibration sensor apps on my phone (lol) and I kept driving my self nuts by testing the entire house... I kept gettin tiny little crests on the vibration graph so I thought that's it! The house is vibrating!! Wtf?!! That went on till 5 am then I finally fell asleep from exhaustion.. woke up a couple hours later... same thing.. I went to school kept hearing the buzz and feeling the vibration... I started crying in the lecture I COULD NOT believe that this strong vibration that I'm feeling is me! Once I started to wrap my head around it I started feeling like a tremor from the inside with a slight tremor in my hands and feet on the outside and that is still going on till now.. almost 4 days now..

It was terrifying going to the hospital thinking I may have had a stroke there was so many things running through my head and I was terrified that my life was going to be awful after I read up on ms and how debilitating a disease it could be and I was told that not everyone has the same experience but everything I read was going on with me. We had so many plans and it breaks my heart that we may not be able to do them because I love her more than anything and I feel like I'm a burden I couldn't even go to the movies with her because I got so tired.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4722722213560212232/Heads-up,-MS-increases-risk-of-stroke	Heads up, MS increases risk of stroke	As I recently found out, just because I have MS doesn't mean I can't find other ways to malfunction, namely a stroke, and--as if it did not already suck sufficiently--MS increases the risk of stroke--even for young people and those without the usual risk factors. It not only increases the risk, it may make it more complicated to treat or prevent, according to researcher Steven N. Levine, because aspirin may not protect as well, and because stroke symptoms can be mistakenly attributed to MS in an MS patient. (And this is exactly what I did, at first, though the EMT's figured it for a stroke from the git-go.) Knowing what symptoms to watch out for and how to decrease one's risk of stroke where possible might be worthwhile, as if we didn't have enough to worry about.

Officially a member of the club as of yesterday morning. One overwhelming concern I'm having right now is money and work. I've already lost a ton of money having to call out of work and not being able to take shifts because of blood work this, MRI that, etc. My entire work life has been in the security field and now I'm worried about how this will progress and how/if this will eventually force me out of the only field I actually have experience in. During my first flare up in January, working at concerts was very difficult. Trying to rove around the venue with my numb, weak legs made me feel useless. Almost fell down stairs more times than I'd like to admit. Even now, when just checking IDs, I drop stuff constantly. Juggling my flashlight, a stamper and trying to handle hundreds of IDs all night sucks. I feel even worse when someone hands me their license and I immediately drop it on the floor. 	1	1	What|do|y|’|all|do|for|work|,|and|how|has|this|disease|affected|your|jobs|?

Hi /r/MS fam I've been lurking here for a month (since I was DX'd last month) my heart goes out to all you folks, I can only imagine how tough many of your lives have become (and me with my Canadian medicine I totally feel for you folks who are bordered on top of the disease, with less compassionate care). I feel also fortunate that I'm only RRMS ...and old (am 50 years old and my first ON flare-up was this year) So I'm trying to come through terms with all of this, and working on bringing today and meditation *back* into my lazy-ass life, and eating tons more fermented food (just in case all that talk about microflora can help) and even playing around with raw cacao to help me stay awake 'cause all of the sudden I can sleep 15 hours a night. My neurologist is cool with me doing the more holistic stuff, but he is even more in the camp than me that early treatment might be better in the long run... So that being said, he suggested I start with the teriflunomide. Wondering if anyone has experience with this? Will I go bald? Will there be other side effects to expect? Good stories? Nightmares? I appreciate all your time and wishing everyone less flare ups and less pain!! Thanks! 	1	1	About|to|start|Aubagio|...|Should|I|buy|wigs|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4722375446364933352/Neuro-appointment-next-month.-Need-feedback-on-my-plan.	Neuro appointment next month. Need feedback on my plan.	"Hi fellow Ms'ers. First, let me say how great a resource this sub has been for me. Although I haven't posted here, reading the experiences of others afflicted with this crappy disorder has helped me in so many ways. I feel much more informed after having found you guys. I have a few questions for you all regarding symptoms, meds etc. I am headed to see my Neurologist in about three weeks. I think I've developed a plan, but would like your input or comments. First, some background: I am 30, Male, and have been diagnosed RRMS for about 2 years. I have 3 kids and a wife who depend on me, and a promising future in my career if I can successfully manage this MS. I was diagnosed following a bout of optic neuritis nearly 3 years ago. Looking back, there were some strange things (electric shock sensations, tingling) going back up to 13 years that I believe were symptoms. I found a great neurologist who I am comfortable with. Current symptoms: (that I'm sure are MS caused) An intermittent tingling sensation on the right side of my face. ""Shots"" of pain, in my arms, legs and a couple other places. (Usually on the left side. Sometimes mild, sometimes pretty painful) Muscle twitches. Mostly in left eye and leg. Slight blurring of my vision, especially at night and when tired or stressed. Bouts of fatigue A strange and painful numbness that starts in my left fingertips and progresses up my left arm. So far it hasn't persisted longer that a few hours at a time. Some things I've noticed that may be MS. (I would appreciate your input on this) Back pain. My back constantly hurts. Migraines. Sometimes I make dumb mistakes (confuse months, screwing up basic addition etc..) A couple instances of ""flushing"", light headedness, and what seems to be depersonalization/derealization from what I have read. Bouts of sudden and frequent urge to urinate. I have been on copaxone and 3000iu of Vitamin D since diagnosis. I told my neuro that I wanted to attack this aggressively while I'm young and healthy. I hate injecting myself every day. I hate it. Especially considering that Copaxone doesn't have a reputation as very effective. It seems weird to me that my symptoms seem in many cases to be more intermittent. Is that normal? What does it mean? Anyways, given the symptoms I've been experiencing, and copaxone being a less effective and unpleasant dmd, I plan to ask my neurologist to switch me to Ocrevus. I will be seeing him in a couple of weeks to review my recent MRI. So to summarize, the questions I'd like your perspectives on: Is Ocrevus an appropriate step for me to take? I would describe my symptoms as mild usually, and have about 7 lesions I know about. Is the intermittent nature of my symptoms normal? There are some longer term relapses I've had (ON, weakness in my left arm), but many seem to come and go over the course of only hours sometimes (Shots of pain, tingling in face, numbness in arm, muscle twitches). Is this ""normal"" for MS? Finally, are those symptoms I described as ""possibly from MS"" reasonable to attribute to MS? Sometimes it's hard not to feel like maybe I'm a hypochondriac in some sense. It's tough to recognize what's a normal part of the human experience vs. what's MS. Lots of things I thought everyone experiences have turned out not to be! Thank you all!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4722040900623775986/My-brain-is.....-swamp-mush?-Help?	My brain is..... swamp mush? Help?	Hello everyone, and thank you for having me. I apologize for being unable to come up with a witty title at the moment. Lately my connaughton issues have been getting worse and worse. Physically, I'm okay for the moment. Pretty ambulatory and able to do day-to-day functions for the most part. Some days are better than others. I have a couple of canes around, but thankfully I haven't had to use the much so far this year. But I swear my brain is being liquefied in a blender! I keep forgetting where I'm putting things, how to spell things, what certain words are. (Which is really bad because years ago I was considered a very accomplished linguist and translator.) It's terrible! I keep walking in the rooms and having no idea why I'm there. Today I called my cousin, and couldn't remember why I did! A couple of times, I've completely lost my train of thought and felt like I was getting lost inside of my own brain, if that makes any sense. A few people have commented on my behavior lately and I'm beginning to wonder if I'm just genuinely losing it. Advice or words of support would be great. I just hope that I'm not completely crazy. I'm 28 years old and I was diagnosed in 2014. Thank you again for taking the time to read this and I hope you have a pleasant day. 	1	1	My|brain|is|...|swamp|mush|?|Help|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4722010226826520416/Went-to-the-spine-specialist-today-and-didnt-get-the-news-I-was-hoping-for...	Went to the spine specialist today and didn’t get the news I was hoping for...	I had an MRI of my lumbar spine about a month ago. The report said they saw 3 degenerative/bulging discs and a cyst. My doctor was hopeful that maybe my leg weakness/numbness was caused by the spinal issues and not MS. Today was my appointment with the spine specialist. He showed me the MRIs and how my spinal cord is never affected by any of the issues with my spine. The cyst is really small and nowhere near the cord. The degeneration is minimal and the discs are still doing their job. He said he was confident that none of my leg issues are caused by anything from the spine issues and that they are most likely all effects of the MS. Really had my hopes up because I had a flare a few weeks ago that affected my left leg. My right leg has been weaker for a while but my left was always strong. This last flare made my entire right leg go numb and my left leg to go numb from the knee down. Made it tough to walk, especially up and down stairs, and I had to take a couple days off running. So I was hoping that all the leg issues were something that could possibly be fixed, but no. I always knew in the back of my mind, that the MS was probably to blame. 	1	1	Went|to|the|spine|specialist|today|and|didn|’|t|get|the|news|I|was|hoping|for|...

She was diagnosed a little over a year ago and immediately put onto an infusion of Ocrevus every 6 months with MRIs once a year. The Ocrevus has slowed the relapses/flare ups quite a bit but now it seems she has more severe flare ups when they do occur. Her last infusion was about two weeks ago and her last MRI was about 6 months ago. The MRI concluded that she had no new lesions. Fast forward to last night. She had a flare up that was one of the most severe since she had started treatment. Very violent convulsions, temporary loss of consciousness, and what is most alarming of all: loss of the ability to speak, not altogether, just English. I should state that English is her first language but she also speaks German and Spanish and can speak them clearly but when she tries to speak in English she can't actually make the words come out. The only time I've known of something similar happening is when she's drunk she only speaks in Spanish or after an operation when she was woken up from anesthesia she could only speak in German or Spanish. I've read about things like this happening to Stroke victims or rare cases of it happening to people but had no idea to the extent of it. I can't find anything about it online. Does anyone have anything similar or medical info to follow up on this? I should mention that her English had started improving but with a strange German accent as if she had never spoken English in her life although it appears she's starting to lose the ability to speak in English again. We thought about going to the ER but the last times we've gone they only thing they've done for her have been to give her steroids which don't exactly improve the situation too much. I called her neurologist and he couldn't tell me anything and her next MRI isn't until the summer. Any input would be appreciated or if anyone her speaks multiple languages and has any insight that would also be appreciated. Thank you, guys. 	1	1	Haven't|been|able|to|find|anything|else|about|this|and|hoping|maybe|this|community|could|provide|some|insight	So|,|my|fiancé|has|MS|.|She|was|diagnosed|a|little|over|a|year|ago|and|immediately|put|onto|an|infusion|of|Ocrevus|every|6|months|with|MRIs|once|a|year|.|The|Ocrevus|has|slowed|the|relapses|/|flare|ups|quite|a|bit|but|now|it|seems|she|has|more|severe|flare|ups|when|they|do|occur|.|Her|last|infusion|was|about|two|weeks|ago|and|her|last|MRI|was|about|6|months|ago|.|The|MRI|concluded|that|she|had|no|new|lesions|.|Fast|forward|to|last|night|.|She|had|a|flare|up|that|was|one|of|the|most|severe|since|she|had|started|treatment|.|Very|violent|convulsions|,|temporary|loss|of|consciousness|,|and|what|is|most|alarming|of|all|:|loss|of|the|ability|to|speak|,|not|altogether|,|just|English|.|I|should|state|that|English|is|her|first|language|but|she|also|speaks|German|and|Spanish|and|can|speak|them|clearly|but|when|she|tries|to|speak|in|English|she|can't|actually|make|the|words|come|out|.|The|only|time|I've|known|of|something|similar|happening|is|when|she's|drunk|she|only|speaks|in|Spanish|or|after|an|operation|when|she|was|woken|up|from|anesthesia|she|could|only|speak|in|German|or|Spanish|.|I've|read|about|things|like|this|happening|to|Stroke|victims|or|rare|cases|of|it|happening|to|people|but|had|no|idea|to|the|extent|of|it|.|I|can't|find|anything|about|it|online|.|Does|anyone|have|anything|similar|or|medical|info|to|follow|up|on|this|?|I|should|mention|that|her|English|had|started|improving|but|with|a|strange|German|accent|as|if|she|had|never|spoken|English|in|her|life|although|it|appears|she's|starting|to|lose|the|ability|to|speak|in|English|again|.|We|thought|about|going|to|the|ER|but|the|last|times|we've|gone|they|only|thing|they've|done|for|her|have|been|to|give|her|steroids|which|don't|exactly|improve|the|situation|too|much|.|I|called|her|neurologist|and|he|couldn't|tell|me|anything|and|her|next|MRI|isn't|until|the|summer|.|Any|input|would|be|appreciated|or|if|anyone|her|speaks|multiple|languages|and|has|any|insight|that|would|also|be|appreciated|.|Thank|you|,|guys|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4722010226828819223/Found-this-Article-I-found-interesting-from-MSEO	Found this Article I found interesting from MSEO	[https://www.mymseo.org/Spotlight/](https://www.mymseo.org/Spotlight/)   Found on the MSEO website. Not sure how good the link is going to be good for because they update their website monthly but thought you might like it or relate to it like I did. I'm posting it below to save for myself for the future to look at in case the link goes to something different in the future. ## But You Don't Look Sick! Renee Cannizzo Put yourself in a busy parking lot. You've been circling for 15 minutes trying to find parking. All that's left are the disability spots near the front door. You see a car pull in from the street and slide into a disability spot. Hangtag on the mirror, the disability symbol on the license plate: what do you expect to see when the person gets out of the car? I used to expect to see someone with some sort of visible or physical impairment. Perhaps you expect to see a senior citizen that walks slowly. The last thing you expect to see is a young woman in her late twenties. She doesn't seem to be walking with difficulty. What are you thinking? Are you thinking: “What the heck?! There's nothing wrong with her! She's probably using her grandma's placard.”? We all think it; myself included. What we fail to realize is that there are invisible diseases and illnesses. There are people who are chronically ill that you can't see by their appearance. ## One of these chronic illnesses is Multiple Sclerosis (MS). A lot of people have heard of MS or know someone who has been affected by it. When I tell people I have MS one of the first things that happens is the head cocked to the side and the “I'm so sorry” smile that people do, the second thing is “I know so and so suffered from that.” Even with the acknowledgment that such a disease exists a lot of times people think of it in extremes. In television and movies when you see someone with MS it is often depicted as worst case scenario. ## I have Multiple Sclerosis. That sentence is one of the hardest ones I have ever had to say out loud. I had lost some significant vision in my left eye. I was staunchly against going to see a doctor. I was in enough pain that I decided to go see the optometrist. “There is nothing wrong with your eye that I can tell,” she said after sitting through two hours of tests, “you can use some of these steroid eye drops and maybe that will help.” She sent me on my way. It was a Friday afternoon and there wasn't much more that could be done. I scrounged together what I could to get the eye drops. They would help for a couple of minutes but then it would hurt and be even more blurry. ## On Saturday afternoon I got a call from the optometrist office. “I've been thinking about you all through the night last night,” she said. ## “Oh great,” I thought to myself, “just what everyone wants to hear from a doctor! Maybe there's something seriously wrong, oh no. What could it be?” My mind started racing a little. “You told me the drops weren't really doing much to help right? Well I really think you should go see a neurologist. There's one I can give you a referral to, one I work with frequently.” I took down the information, it was now Saturday and they weren't open. I would have to wait till Monday morning. The weekend was filled with fears and tears. Some of the tears were from the unknown and some of the tears were from the pain that was continuing to mount behind my eyes. Thankfully the neurologist was able to get me in to see him on Tuesday. After another round of “can you see this” type of tests the doctor looked concerned. “I think we need to do a spinal tap. I feel confident that you might have Multiple Sclerosis.” The spinal tap, or lumbar puncture, is used to help diagnose multiple sclerosis. They also use MRI's for confirmation and to see how progressed the disease is. (For more information please visit www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS) I remember feeling confused. “If something is wrong with my eye, why do they need to stick a needle in my spine?” I should probably mention at this point I was deathly afraid of needles. I saw my pediatrician until I was 21 because they used baby needles. I could barely have blood drawn without crying or having a panic attack. So the thought of a needle going into my spine paralyzed me. At least the doctor was feeling good about it, I remember him joking (before he plunges a huge needle into me) “Oh wow, it's been years since I've done one of these!” I know he was joking and trying to ease the tension but it's all about timing and reading the room. This was not the room for that joke. That needle was the first of many life changing needle pokes I would have to endure. I have been forced to overcome my fear of needles and can now confidently point out where on my arm has the best spot for a blood draw. ## “Multiple Sclerosis.” When I first heard the words come out of the doctor's mouth my first thought was that it was a death sentence. My mind went blank and crazy all at the same time. Have you ever had your computer freeze while you had a bunch of tabs open on the browser? The screen starts blinking, you can hear music playing but you can't make the system work. That's how my brain was, and still is sometimes. “But don't worry,” he continued, “IF it is Multiple Sclerosis it's just the beginning because you don't have any other symptoms.” I got home that day still in a daze and made my first dumb decision. I went to Google. If you've ever had a head cold or small ailment and gone to Google you know about the rabbit hole. One click leads to another and another, and then all the sudden you somehow are going to die in the next month. One good thing that came from Google was the National MS Society. ## Through the National MS Society website I was able to find information about a support group. It was an all women support group that met once a month not too far from where I was living. They happened to have a meeting a couple days away. I sent an email to request to be signed up into the group. The email I got back from the coordinator stated the time, place and name of the leader for the meeting. So I made my way to them the next week, not sure what to expect. In the movies and television shows MS is usually depicted at life end stages. People unable to feed themselves, wasting away, unable to walk, tremors and a variety of other scary things - I was sure that was what I was going to see in the support group. The group was all women and I was surprised when I got to the group to see a bunch of women who didn't look sick at all. Sure there were a couple of women that used a cane but really they all looked, for lack of a better word, normal. One of the first topics brought up in the group was people being shamed and always hearing the words “but you don't look sick.” ##. “But you don't look sick” is one of the most frustrating sentences someone with chronic illness can hear. It's not typically meant as a compliment, it's usually meant as an accusation. The shame a person feels when they are told that they don't look sick is unimaginable. ## I was having a good day recently. I felt good about how I was walking, I had to go to the store to get just a few small things. When I go to the store, I don't often use my walker because I use the electric carts or I use a regular cart as my walker. I used my disability parking permit. I used a shopping cart as my walker that day. After being in the store for twenty minutes I was headed back to my car. There was a note on my windshield. At first I thought “Oh hell, I guess someone hit my car.” In my worst dreams I could not have imagined what was written. “You are not disabled,” it read, “you should be ashamed using a handicap spot when you are clearly not disabled. Make better choices. Jesus is watching you.” My mind crumbled into mush. My first reaction was to cry, it wasn't sad tears, it was tears of anger. How dare someone judge me when they don't know my story? ## My first symptom with MS was losing my vision. Have you ever tried to watch a 3D movie without the right glasses? Everything seems a little wonky and makes you dizzy? Yep, that's what it was like. Colors were distorted, I couldn't see straight and it got to the point where I couldn't discern features of people. I was able to see if someone was standing in front of me but I couldn't tell you their race, hair color, facial features or anything. It was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. I was instructed to go to the Emergency Room at the local hospital; I wasn't able to drive so my mother took me. The local hospital was a teaching hospital, which I had no problems with at all. Unfortunately, that meant things took a little bit longer. Terrified, I sat in the waiting room with my mother, the pain behind my eyes mounting, my vision waning. My mother trying her best to be positive and get a solution. The time came to sit in the examination room, the first doctor came by and told me he was going to get the neurologist team to come and see me. So we sat and waited. Then what happened? We sat and waited some more. After some more sitting and waiting, finally a group of people came in the room. It was the neurologist with his group of students. There were a lot of people in the room, I don't remember how many. They took turns examining me. The neurologist confirms the fear. “It is a Multiple Sclerosis flare up. We are going to start you on some IV steroids and you're going to be admitted to the hospital for 5 days.” My brain went numb and froze again. They all left the room. My mother came to sit on the bed next to me and the second her arm went around me, I felt the explosion of emotion. The tears ran down my face as I sobbed into my mother's arms, unable to form words. I had never been admitted to a hospital before, I didn't know what to expect but there was an even bigger problem. I looked to my mother, tears on both of our faces. In between sobs I was able to articulate one sentence. “Mom,” I sobbed, “The worst thing about all this is just simply the fact that I can't even tell if any of my doctors are cute!” ##. She couldn't help it, my mother busted out laughing. The tears slowed as the laughter increased. The tension was eased, I knew I wasn't alone. Over the next 6 months MS hit hard and fast. I was 29 years old and was having bladder incontinence, I had to go stand in the store and buy adult diapers for myself. I might have stood there staring at them for 45 minutes before I had the courage to buy them. My first year of diagnosis I spent 63 days hospitalized, not all in one shot. I have a lot of stories about being in the hospitals, there was a running joke in my family about how to tell if a hospital is any good by their mashed potatoes (I had a rating system). I've even tried to spice up a visit by pretending my hospital bed they were wheeling down the hall for an MRI was a race car, those are stories for another time. Over all it was scary how bad MS was completely changing my life. Then came the worst blow: my legs became weak. I couldn't walk without falling down. I ended up with a wheelchair, inpatient physical therapy and a walker. My life was never going to be the same. Through years of physical therapy I only need the wheelchair when doing something like going to Disney World (which I do a lot because I live in Florida and I can), I need to use a rollator walker daily, especially at work so I don't fall down. I can walk short distances without it. When at the grocery store, I'll walk into the store and use a cart for stability. Sometimes I have something called foot drop. What does it feel like? It feels like wearing a pair of swim flippers on land while attaching a fifteen-pound weight to them. While this doesn't happen with every step I take, it happens often enough to need a rollator walker frequently. So it happened that I went to the store the other day, I was having a good day. The pain was minimal, my walking was relatively normal; however, I still used a disability spot to park. Each step takes energy and while it may look like no big deal, each step is painfully and completely planned out. So the person who left a note on my windshield might have been well intentioned but it was a painful reminder of being judged unfairly. I then get to thinking, why me, what did I do wrong? Instead of feeling rewarded and proud of myself for looking “normal” I felt shamed. ## There is a collective “we” in the universe. Most of us are taught at an early age not to judge a book by its cover. This lesson is important so that we can know that it's not what is on the outside but what is on the inside that counts. So is it wrong to get annoyed at the person who looks like they are walking okay but parked in disability? Sometimes the annoyance is justified. People do abuse others disability parking access but that doesn't mean it's everyone. Some people take it into their own hands to shame people they don't think should be able to park in a disability spot. No disability is the same and at any given time some people who have MS could be having a good day and then out of nowhere symptoms can arise. No one should ever feel the need to justify themselves. I know what you are wondering, “But how does this story end?” I often wonder the same thing. There isn't an ending to this story. The battle against invisible illness will plague me forever. It is very easy to get lost in feeling alone within chronic or invisible illness. The important thing is no one is alone, now you are with me in spirit too.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4721403948022693304/Optic-Neuritis	Optic Neuritis	My partner (34m) has been diagnosed with optic neuritis. Just to be clear he has not been diagnosed with MS but wondering if anyone here could shed some light on the condition as there isn't a lot of info around. He's into week 2 and vision in one eye still hasn't fully returned. How long did it take for your vision to recover and what steps did you need to take while recovering?

Tingling throughout my body ( shoulders, arms legs) for the last several months. Really becoming bothersome. 2. Trouble swallowing and esophogeal irritation. I had a barium scan which indicated muscle weakness in esophagus. 3. Increase in frequency of visual auras - I always though these were kind of a migraine so never paid much attention (they only last for 30 minutes or so and then seem to go away). Floaters have been an issue for a long time. 4. Lately fatigue/malaise has become more of an issue, and neural/visual issues which are hard to explain, but kind of a lack of awareness of my periphery 5. Balance is deteriorating. All this said, am I just getting old? LOL Or does this point to MS or something else?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4720992921657896237/Is-it-MS?	Is it MS?	Hi. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just somewhere to discuss what's been going on. I am in the process of finding a new PCP and once I do I will make an appointment & start to find out what's going on with me. I'm (47 F). Some history, I have back issues due to scoliosis and had disc surgery in 2007. I was diagnosed with RLS about 10 years ago and have been on Reqip that long as well. One day in 2010 while working I started having sharp headaches in my left temple. They came & went all day. That night as I was going to speak to my husband I couldn't. I could not form words. I just could not get them to come out. He took me to the ER, I was admitted. They ran every test under the sun on me and came back and said what occurred was due to stress. A few weeks after that event I had a follow up with the neurologist. The neurologist I saw in the hospital was on vacation so I saw his partner. In the appointment he was looking at my MRI and said that the original neurologist was very concerned because he saw several lesions on my brain, he even made the comment “that I had the brain of a 70 year old woman” but this doctor said he disagreed and my MRI looked fine. At that point I should have gotten a second opinion but I didn't. That was the last time I saw the neurologist. In the last few years things have started changing, my eyesight has progressively gotten much worse. I have had instances where I can't form words, they are brief and only last a few minutes but it happens, I am forgetful, not a lot but when it happens it lasts a few days and I basically forget everything. For example I was working on a project in Jan and I was presenting, we had to reschedule because I forgot what I was doing. My arms tingle at bedtime. And this is the worst one, incontinence. I was at work one day and all of a sudden my pants were wet. OMG, I had to come home and change. Now I'm wearing Depends everyday because I could just pee out of the blue. So there is a crap load of stuff going on and yes as soon as I get the OK from my insurance that the PCP I picked is good I'm making an appointment. I'm terrified. 	1	0	Is|it|MS|?

Hey friends, I'm suffering from a currently unknown neurological disease. A few of the doctor's I've seen have seen have suggested it is MS, but my MRI was clean so it's still a mystery for now. That said, I am at the beginning of another relapse right now, and I wanted to know what the course of a relapse was like for folks who definitely had MS. For me, my symptoms will gradually increase in severity for a month or month and a half, before stabilizing for about a month, and then slowly getting better over 1-2 months. (waiting to see just how bad they're going to get after the first tingles in my arm is always torture) From what I've read, MS relapses sound like they come on more suddenly, but I wanted to know what it was like for you guys.

Just want to share an experience I had recently that really changed how I'm dealing with my diagnosis.	I was diagnosed recently, and overall I've been handling it fairly well. I decided to continue on with my life as normally as possible and not live my life in fear of what may happen. Realistically though, I've had a few moments where I was having trouble staying positive. However, something happened the other day that really got me thinking, and it helped me a lot so I wanted to share. I was visiting an elderly family member in the hospital the other day, and she was in a room with 3 other patients. One of these patients was a lady who had just had surgery to remove a lung tumor, and her odds of survival at 3 years is only 50/50. Depressing right? Nope. She is taking it all in stride and decided to live her life on her terms and enjoy everything life has to offer, cancer be damned. After speaking with her, I decided that if she could face her own mortality and still live her life and see the good things, then there's no reason why someone like myself with ms shouldn't, or couldn't do the same. I really needed that more than I can put into words, but I'm trying because I think it's something we could all learn from. 	1	1	Just|want|to|share|an|experience|I|had|recently|that|really|changed|how|I'm|dealing|with|my|diagnosis|.

Last year I had an mri after complaining about headaches for a month or two (mri showed lesions in both hemispheres of my brain). The neuro I saw didn't think it was anything too serious and I'm currently being treated for chronic migraines. However, there have been a few symptoms that have started in the last few months which I don't think really fit in with migraines (I have suffered migraines all my life). I am currently awaiting a second opinion from a new neuro (appointment is still a couple months out). But one of my doctors mentioned that it may be ms. I'm just not really sure what to think and it's tough because there is so much waiting involved. But, how did it start for you? Was it sudden or more gradual? Were headaches involved? Is there anything I can do in the mean time or do I just have to wait? 	1	0	I|’|m|facing|a|possible|diagnosis|of|MS|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4720769756224873118/22-M-CIS,-just-on-spine---has-anyone-else-gone-on-to-develop-MS-from-this?	22 (M) CIS, just on spine - has anyone else gone on to develop MS from this?	Hi everyone! I wanted to post to get some thoughts as it seems I have a peculiar type of CIS. Essentially one day after lifting waits I woke up and had some numbness in the top of the toes, which progressed to fingertips and chest area. Eventually I saw the Neurologist and got a Brain and Spine MRI done, of which showed that I have one lesion on the neck which is the cause of my numbness; and diagnosed with CIS. Since then toes numbness has disappeared, as has most of my chest and I'm left with just the fingers (annoyingly because of needing to type everyday buts its not the end of the world) but this is to be expected as CIS usually lasts 3-6months before disappearing. My Neurologist says I have a 90% chance of not developing MS, 9% of 'good' ms (responsive to treatment), and 1% chance of 'bad' ms (not very responsive to treatment). Logically, I should be feeling not too worried as 1% chance of some disability isn't too bad. However, I'm a very active and confident person pursuing a career in tech sales and love to weight lift and train MMA - I even had my first MMA fight recently. The reason I say this is because the idea of being strong mentally yet having a body that is weak that I can do nothing about really bothers me. I know its part of the grieving process to accept the possibility of developing this illness, but it is just really daunting especially at only 22 years old. The irony also isnt lost on me about being strong mentally yet still being worried haha! This has been a bit of a stream of consciousness post, but I guess I wanted to know as the title suggests if anyone has had CIS on the spine and gone on to develop MS? From my understanding, CIS just on the spine is much more uncommon then on the brain, and the rarest location for MS to develop from. Thanks in advance, I really appreciate any comments about your experiences :). 	1	0	22|(|M|)|CIS|,|just|on|spine|-|has|anyone|else|gone|on|to|develop|MS|from|this|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4720769756225863432/I-lost-4-years-of-my-life-after-being-diagnosed	I lost 4 years of my life after being diagnosed	I was diagnosed out of the blue at 22. I know that a lot of people went years with strange symptoms and trying hard to get a doctor to give them a diagnosis. For me it happened in 4 months. I was sitting at work one day when I had a seizure, I work at a hospital so I woke up in the ICU and everything changed. Thankfully due to private health insurance I saw a Neurologist quickly who diagnosed me after 2 MRIs. I'd had “symptoms” for a few years but I never knew that's what they were, I just thought everyone's legs were a bit buzzy and tired, and their eyes were very sensitive to light. The next 4 years passed by in an absolute blur of numbness and depression. I had no idea at the time how much I had lost who I was as a person, and no one in my life noticed either. It wasn't until I went off the contraceptive pill and the haze of the hormones wore off that it felt like a fog had lifted out of my mind. It's been a year now since I “woke up” and I've felt more and more like my old self as the months have passed. I've found more comfort in relationships, opened myself up to new people and experiences and started living again. I've found more important things in my life than MS.

I've had both half infusions, full infusion in six months. The last few days I've had a severe stabbing pain in my right eye. I've had vague black/gray shapes in both eyes from time to time for a few months now. This is the first time I've had pain. I see my neuro in May. I have shitty insurance. I'm calling my eye doctor Monday to see if they can work out something so I can see him. He's been my eye doc off and on since I was a teen, my eyes have always sucked and he's the only one that has been able to correctly get my lenses right. I saw him right before I was officially diagnosed. His sister has MS, so he was very aware and told me what to look for as far as my eyes go. Anyway, this pain has me concerned.

Please don't chastise me, I'm really just trying to understand. My mom and I have had, what I personally believe is, a very rock relationship since I can remember. She's always treated me and talked to me like an adult, which sometimes got ugly. When I was 6, she was diagnosed with RRMS. Around age 10, she went on long-term disability and has been out of the workforce completely since then. As the only child, I have been on the receiving end of plenty of MS-related symptoms. Anger, being the main one. I've always just felt that my mom has treated me poorly, and in some cases thought she was downright manipulative. As a kid, it's hard to process that she has a condition that's at the root of many of these problems. Even at 23, I often forget that. To me, the worst part is that she's never apologized to me for anything hurtful she's said. This isn't hyperbole, even she has said that she hasn't. She claims that all of her emotions and outbursts are due to MS, and I that I just don't understand. I asked her if she has any control over them at all and she says no, so she won't apologize for them. This is hard for me, because, firstly, none of our issues get resolved because she doesn't acknowledge them. Secondly, it feels like I have to simply endure the awful and nasty things she says to me, and if I address them I'm just being inconsiderate of her illness. I want to be understanding, and know I haven't done the best job of it, but how do I navigate this dynamic? It feels very harmful and often leaves me stressed and upset. 	1	1	How|do|I|navigate|my|relationship|with|my|mom|who|has|MS|?

I've always had wanderlust, but it got so intense that it motivated me through college. In a really cruel twist of fate, I got diagnosed with MS literally a MONTH after I graduated college and it feels like things have been going downhill ever since. I get so angry because I had tons of friends in college who were just there because they didn't know what else to do, but I actually had a huge dream I was months away from experiencing and now it's gone. I'm in a deep funk because I still feel the same way I did before MS--I want to go while I'm still young but I also feel a bit like I'm wearing a leash keeping me tethered here because now I have a zillion different meds to worry about, doctor visits, MRIs... it feels like I'm not even living life anymore. I want to just GO, but is it even possible anymore? Has anyone ever worked or taught overseas post-diagnosis? I try so hard to be positive, but I'm tired of pretending I'm not completely devastated. 	1	1	Traveling|Abroad|Advice	Hi|all|,|Before|MS|,|I|had|dreams|of|teaching|English|in|South|Korea|and|traveling|the|world|.|I've|always|had|wanderlust|,|but|it|got|so|intense|that|it|motivated|me|through|college|.|In|a|really|cruel|twist|of|fate|,|I|got|diagnosed|with|MS|literally|a|MONTH|after|I|graduated|college|and|it|feels|like|things|have|been|going|downhill|ever|since|.|I|get|so|angry|because|I|had|tons|of|friends|in|college|who|were|just|there|because|they|didn't|know|what|else|to|do|,|but|I|actually|had|a|huge|dream|I|was|months|away|from|experiencing|and|now|it's|gone|.|I'm|in|a|deep|funk|because|I|still|feel|the|same|way|I|did|before|MS--I|want|to|go|while|I'm|still|young|but|I|also|feel|a|bit|like|I'm|wearing|a|leash|keeping|me|tethered|here|because|now|I|have|a|zillion|different|meds|to|worry|about|,|doctor|visits|,|MRIs|...|it|feels|like|I'm|not|even|living|life|anymore|.|I|want|to|just|GO|,|but|is|it|even|possible|anymore|?|Has|anyone|ever|worked|or|taught|overseas|post-diagnosis|?|I|try|so|hard|to|be|positive|,|but|I'm|tired|of|pretending|I'm|not|completely|devastated|.

I currently have an amazing job with amazing benefits, but simply don't know how much longer I'll be able to keep it. I was out for 7.5 months last year (six weeks the first time and six months the last) and am currently out again (since February 8th). FMLA will only hold my job for a certain period of time and has to be gained back through work (hours on the books). As much as I love what I do, it seems like continuing with a 40 hour work week isn't going to be possible for me. That being said, what type of jobs have you found that are accommodating to your MS? I have health insurance with my company but can get it through my husband's job if need be. However, I **need** to work for my own sanity! As much as I love my kids, I have never been one to stay home. I enjoy time out of the house talking to other humans. I'm a 35yo female with experience in hospitality (7 years) and P&C insurance (14 years). I'm open to pretty much anything that gets me out of the house and puts a little money in my pocket but that I also don't have to worry about losing every time I'm out with my illness. I know staying out permanently on LTD is always an option but I truly feel better knowing I have somewhere to go and help others whilst bringing in income as well.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4719569123916301014/The-mental-aspect-is-the-worst-part.-I-need-a-positive-story-and-optimism.-Thanks!	The mental aspect is the worst part. I need a positive story and optimism. Thanks!	The mental aspect is the hardest part. Right now I don't even feel many symptoms. Only minor buzzing when I look down a some neck stiffness. But today was a bad day. Why? Because I can't stop thinking about the fact that I have MS. I keep googling. And no one has anything good to say about anything. A lot of things I read make me feel like I'm just dying slowly. I'm only 23. I'm about to graduate and marry my girlfriend. I just want to wake up from this bad dream. I am newly diagnosed. I've prayed more than I have in my entire life. I've changed my diet completely. My flare only lasted 2 weeks. It ended when I went all organic. Now I wish I just ate right, and never went to the doctor. In retrospect, the flares I had in the past always went away when I cleaned up my diet. I wish I had just did that again. Instead of going to the doctor. Because now I know. The mental aspect of this is so tough. I barely have symptoms at the moment but in my head, my whole world is different. Tv isn't the same. Food isn't the same. Sex isn't the same. Music isn't the same. Ill get these small windows where my mind is thinking about something else. And then ill feel a tingle in my hand and my mood falls to the floor. I worry about my future. Who will hire me with this? Will I ever be happy again? I just want to have a decent day. I was diagnosed maybe a month ago. I haven't had a decent day since. I try to find optimism and fake optimism but it isn't working. Y'all are the only people I can talk to that go through this. I need optimism from someone who's had this for a while. What do you do to feel normal while in remission? I feel like I should milk this time for what its worth before I have another relapse. How long was your longest remission? And how long did it take post-dx to genuinely have nice days where you weren't thinking about this. I can't stop googling. Thanks family and I love all of you. I really mean that. God bless. 	1	1	The|mental|aspect|is|the|worst|part|.|I|need|a|positive|story|and|optimism|.|Thanks|!

Boyfriend's sister had her baby and we had an impromptu chance to go with his family to see the new addition. I was excited to go but I didn't realize it'd be such a long drive. The morning of, his mother said they're stopping off somewhere to sight-see on the way and that'd add 1.5 hours to the drive. This prompted me to ask how long of a drive it'd be. It's 5 hours there and 5 hours back, with the added time for sightseeing this equals to 11.5 hours possibly all in one day, possibly 6.5 there today and 5 hours home tomorrow morning. I told him I'm not sure I can handle a drive that long, and he said something along the line of ""you don't think you can sit for that long?"" In a sarcastic manner. This hurt my feelings so I told him I don't like him insinuating I'm lazy, and it that's how he was gonna talk to me I didn't want to go. I've been a lot less active since my initial relapse (diagnosed with RRMS September 2017), and my fatigue and pain and depression has been getting to me, so I understand that yeah, it does seem like I'm just being lazy. We got into a fight because he's upset I said I wanted to go and changed my mind right before they were going to come get us. It just escalated and he said he was done, we're over. There was some back and forth and he still tried to get me to go, which was confusing to me since he just broke up with me. He left with his family and I had a panic attack then called my Mom to get me so I could have someone with me. It's just, I've felt for a while that he doesn't really understand what I'm going through, I've been having some intense anxiety lately and I mostly just keep it to myself and cry a lot, but I've told him what I'm going through and how I've felt... Idk, I'm just not sure what to do, and I know there's a lot of aspects in this situation I forgot to cover but... Should I just accept that we've tried and let it go?

Exercise, stress management, med compliance, etc. And I've actually been doing pretty well with that. Except when it comes to sugar. I want very much to improve my diet and lose weight, not for vanity's sake, but in case I end up losing motor function and need to be cared for. And because I really don't want to end up with both MS and diabetes. But out of control sugar binges are killing me. Diets, therapy, meditation, 12 step groups, nothing has helped. And I realized this week it's because sugar is the only medicine that I can feel working, but it only works while I'm actually eating it. When my mouth is full of sugar is the one time when I really feel distracted from how much pain I'm in. My ability to resist sugar rests with how much physical and emotional pain I'm in. I'm trying to figure out what to do with this information. On the one hand I understand what's standing in my way.

I've gone from wondering when Im going to become an incontinent cripple to getting hyped for getting my lifts back up. Im so thankful that this exists. Secondly, my mother (50-60)also suffers from the disease. She is not taking any medication and Im confident she has PPMS. Her symptoms are much more severe. Her left arm is almost useless other than holding thing precariously and she can barely walk. Has anyone else had great improvements after starting treatment after years of nontreatment? Basicaly, is it worth it in advanced cases? I should note I have not told her of my diagnosis due to her negative attitude towards medicine and science.

I am a 31 year old male let's just become a father for the first time. My MS something I need to address it affects the left arm and the left side of my face when under severe stress. I still haven't regained feeling and sensation in my hand but I can use it and co-ordinate with a fine it's just it feels like I have pins and needles constantly in my hand. I Had my relapse when I was training for a strong man event and since my diagnosis I have not trained at the gym and lifted significant weight like I used to. I used to be on your typical bodybuilder diet chicken steak rice eggs insignificant quantity is over 8 meals throughout the day. Since diagnosis my diet is changed significantly I am no longer eating red and white meat I only eat fish and I'm on the odd occasion an egg other than that my diet is purely plant based. I stopped smoking cigars I do a lot more cardio and I don't lift heavy anymore which was my passion. I wanted to compete in strongman but with this new diagnosis I don't think it's appropriate putting my body under significant stress like I used to lifting huge weights. but I lifting weights and not doing my training like I used to is it really bumming me down and I really miss it and I haven't found my place back in the real world I feel like I'm lost without doing something that I've done for the past 10 years. I have just finished my first cycle of meds on mavenclad. Nothing really happened I just feel tired on the four days of meds I've got a few questions that I think the majority on here can help me out with and I would love to hear your perspective on everything. do you think I can go back to training for my strongman event or do you think I need to take it easy and give that sort of training a rest and just focus on losing weight and getting my cardio up? Is anyone with MS a bodybuilder or strongman or powerlifter on here? If they are what are your diets like? very interested to see other people's perspective as if I'm doing the right thing or if I can go back to going hard in the gym. Forgive me I'm new to this whole thing of posting on a forum but I feel that this is a safe place and from what I've read from other people's posts it's been quite informative. Thank you for your time everyone and I look forward to reading your responses. 	1	1	Newly|diagnosed|strongman|with|MS|seeking|some|direction|from|the|masses	G'day|everyone|I|am|a|newly|diagnosed|person|with|MS|.|I|am|a|31|year|old|male|let's|just|become|a|father|for|the|first|time|.|My|MS|something|I|need|to|address|it|affects|the|left|arm|and|the|left|side|of|my|face|when|under|severe|stress|.|I|still|haven't|regained|feeling|and|sensation|in|my|hand|but|I|can|use|it|and|co-ordinate|with|a|fine|it's|just|it|feels|like|I|have|pins|and|needles|constantly|in|my|hand|.|I|Had|my|relapse|when|I|was|training|for|a|strong|man|event|and|since|my|diagnosis|I|have|not|trained|at|the|gym|and|lifted|significant|weight|like|I|used|to|.|I|used|to|be|on|your|typical|bodybuilder|diet|chicken|steak|rice|eggs|insignificant|quantity|is|over|8|meals|throughout|the|day|.|Since|diagnosis|my|diet|is|changed|significantly|I|am|no|longer|eating|red|and|white|meat|I|only|eat|fish|and|I'm|on|the|odd|occasion|an|egg|other|than|that|my|diet|is|purely|plant|based|.|I|stopped|smoking|cigars|I|do|a|lot|more|cardio|and|I|don't|lift|heavy|anymore|which|was|my|passion|.|I|wanted|to|compete|in|strongman|but|with|this|new|diagnosis|I|don't|think|it's|appropriate|putting|my|body|under|significant|stress|like|I|used|to|lifting|huge|weights|.|but|I|lifting|weights|and|not|doing|my|training|like|I|used|to|is|it|really|bumming|me|down|and|I|really|miss|it|and|I|haven't|found|my|place|back|in|the|real|world|I|feel|like|I'm|lost|without|doing|something|that|I've|done|for|the|past|10|years|.|I|have|just|finished|my|first|cycle|of|meds|on|mavenclad|.|Nothing|really|happened|I|just|feel|tired|on|the|four|days|of|meds|I've|got|a|few|questions|that|I|think|the|majority|on|here|can|help|me|out|with|and|I|would|love|to|hear|your|perspective|on|everything|.|do|you|think|I|can|go|back|to|training|for|my|strongman|event|or|do|you|think|I|need|to|take|it|easy|and|give|that|sort|of|training|a|rest|and|just|focus|on|losing|weight|and|getting|my|cardio|up|?|Is|anyone|with|MS|a|bodybuilder|or|strongman|or|powerlifter|on|here|?|If|they|are|what|are|your|diets|like|?|very|interested|to|see|other|people's|perspective|as|if|I'm|doing|the|right|thing|or|if|I|can|go|back|to|going|hard|in|the|gym|.|Forgive|me|I'm|new|to|this|whole|thing|of|posting|on|a|forum|but|I|feel|that|this|is|a|safe|place|and|from|what|I've|read|from|other|people's|posts|it's|been|quite|informative|.|Thank|you|for|your|time|everyone|and|I|look|forward|to|reading|your|responses|.

Since then, I found out I had optic neuritis and received my rrms diagnosis. I now live in fear every day of what will become of me. I worry for my boyfriend who will have to take care of me. Mostly, I worry about my vision. Steroids brought a bit back quickly but it is still pretty poor most of the time and I haven't noticed any improvements in a month and a half. I will often cover my good eye to check for any improvements only find myself thinking, ""if this happens in my right eye too, I'm screwed. I won't be able to work, drive, and who knows what else."" I feel like my life would be over. I fear all the potentials but right now, I mainly fear for my sight. I've lost hope that this will improve any more as I've read that glare, color issues, etc. Often times never go away. My acuity is better now but anyone who says that's good enough is wrong. I would not be able to drive at night if it weren't for my good eye. Feeling very down in the dumps right now thinking, if my first relapse caused this sort of permanent damage... I really don't want to find out what's next. I'm too young to live the rest of my life this way. F*** MS! "	1	1	I|live|in|fear|every|day|.

I have read through lots and lots of posts and have shared this with my non-redditor husband. My husband has been diagnosed with RRMS at 38. We found out on the day we brought our newborn son home from the hospital so it has been quite an interesting journey of acceptance and adjustment. Our son is now 3 months old and I have been doing what I can to limit how much my husbands sleep is disturbed at night and generally trying to reduce the (normal) stress of having a new baby. We have a pretty easy baby so it hasn't been hard. Neuro just prescribed Tecfidera which he will start on soon and that will hopefully help. Apparently there are ""lots and lots"" of lesions and the neuro was really surprised that he walked into the office unassisted based on the scans. Im really just looking for any advice to the folks out there on how I can be a good wife through all of this. I feel like I don't know how much to talk about it. I don't want it to become the only thing we talk about but I also don't want him to feel like I don't care, or I'm in denial, or trying to pretend it isn't happening. I also don't want to make it about me. We're in Ontario and I didn't work enough hours last year to qualify for maternity leave so my husband is taking the entire parental leave portion starting in April until December. Hopefully that will give him time to figure out a routine that works and the Tec will have time to do its thing. We had planned to do a big road trip in the summer and 2 weeks skiing before he goes back to work but now we're hesitant to make any major plans. Anyways, any advice is appreciated. I just needed somewhere to put this I think. "	1	1	How|can|I|be|a|good|wife|?

I haven't been able to get a full-time position since graduating but I am starting a leave replacement in a few weeks. This school year I have been substitute teaching, tutoring 1 on 1 through a school district, and teaching a small class in an after school program. Usually the only symptoms I've had a real issue with is fatigue, but lately I have been having issues speaking while at work. Sometimes I can't find the words I want to say, or can't get them out, and other times I stutter or mess up my words. I'm becoming more self-conscious about these issues and especially with the heavier workload I know I'll have soon, I am starting to doubt my abilities to be an effective teacher. Any teachers out there and how do you manage your symptoms? 	1	1	Any|teachers|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4718152173487508500/CIS...-Possible-MS---wtf?	CIS... Possible MS - wtf?	Hey friends... Just sharing my story... It's been a wild ride. Want to get some thoughts... I've been having symptoms (tingling, numbness, weakness) since mid January. Starting in my feet, progressing overtime into my legs and my hands... doing things like walking down the hallway at work would fatigue me pretty quickly which is not normal for a girl who ran the Philadelphia Marathon in 2017. My PCP referred me to a neurologist pretty early on... my initial MRI didn't show any flaring lesions in my brain or spinal cord ... just some old scarring in my corpus callosum - we're not even sure if it means anything .... I was going to take a halt on testing after the initial MRIs ... go to physical therapy to keep strength in my legs and arms since I couldn't work out anymore and try some other avenues for relief. Then I had a vicious attack 2 weeks ago (admitted to the hospital for 6 nights) - vertigo, inability to walk, facial numbness... while in the hospital I received a lumbar puncture... Which was considered a traumatic puncture because they hit a blood vessel and messed up 3/4 viles... I had the worst head and neck pain for days ... Ugh! I had a 3 day IV steroid treatment to get enough strength back to support weight again... I've been home receiving in-home physical therapy and hoping to get back to work next week... All that has come up from images and lumbar puncture is some old scarring on my corpus callosum, some elevated protein in my spinal fluid, and I had an MRI of my thoracic spine done in the hospital - it showed some enhancement but not a typical MS-like lesion. My neuro said it could be inflammation or could have been from lumbar puncture. Spinal fluid did not show oligoclonal bands - which is usually a tell-tale sign of MS.. but evidently there's still some discrepancies... So my diagnoses at the moment are: demyelinating disorder, CIS and possible MS. My Neuro wants me to see an MS specialist to monitor me at this point. Thanks for reading my story- I hope some of you have some insight! 	1	0	CIS|...|Possible|MS|-|wtf|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4718152173488113110/I-Think-I-Have-MS-and-Im-Scared	I Think I Have MS and I’m Scared	I've been creeping on this reddit page for the past month or so since my symptoms begun. I want your feedback if my symptoms sound similar to yours and if anything makes you think otherwise. I've seen countless doctors and can't arrive at a diagnosis. It started with chest pain after a weekend in Atlanta for the super bowl. My bottom left rib was the origin of the pain and it would come and go. Sometimes in the form of pinching, pressure, and burning. Some days are better than others and this has been going on for a month - probably the most dominant symptom. I've undergone extensive cardio related testing and everything continues to come back normal except my vitamin D which was an 8 - of course this isn't cardiovascular related. A few weeks after the chest pain I started experiencing some arm pain and electric like shocks all over my body but it's pretty controlled - no more than 10 times/day. It's most commonly felt in the extremities. Two weeks ago I begun to see a black floater in my eye and bottom eyelid now is twitching very frequently - something I've never experienced before. I also have random twitching in my body as well. The weird sensations have ramped up and now I'm feeling crawling-like sensations especially in the feet. There has been two instances as well where my legs just feel drenched but there's nothing there. My cardiologist told me it's time to see a neurologist. The neuro doctor gave me an EMG but it came back normal. He thinks I should just wait it out because of the test result. I know you can't virtually diagnose me but can you relate to most if not all symptoms? Everything I google shows MS as the top result and it's the only result really when I google all my symptoms together. I know googling is a slippery slope but I'm scared. I appreciate your insight.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4718038641336020186/MS-taught-me-trust-my-body-more.	MS taught me trust my body more.	"I think I started experiencing my first MS symptoms around age 17/18. I can't say for sure if it was MS but I do remember feeling like I regularly couldn't get the right words out, and like there was something wrong with my memory. It was hardly there, but still noticeable enough that it bothered me. I even half-jokingly told my mom that ""i think there's something wrong with my brain"". Little did I know lol.. Fast forward to the next school year, I started experiencing numbness and tingling on my left side, along with other sensory issues. It was painful to even let water touch those areas of my body. I told myself it was just a pinched nerve. I should've gone to a doctor after a week of this but it resolved on it's own, so I thought it was OK. That summer, I had my first vertigo/double vision attack. I thought I even felt some weakness in my right arm and leg, but it was so minute that I had a hard telling if that's really what I was even feeling. This was the first time I Googled my symptoms. MS came up. All I knew was that MS was bad, and clicked out of that page real fast. ""No way, not me. Google even says it's rare"" - was my thought process. I told myself it was because I hadn't been wearing my glasses lately (I genuinely thought this could've been the case) and that id get it checked out if it lasted longer than a week. It resolved on its own, so I never did. I did Google MS a few times after though. An optic neuritis attack that same Winter ultimately led to my diagnosis. I wasn't surprised at all. The one time I should've listened to Web MD lol. Ive felt guilt looking back at all these warning signs I missed. I probably could've been diagnosed earlier. But this whole experience has taught me that it's alright to not feel ok. If I feel like something is wrong with my body, then im doing myself a disservice by not getting it checked out.

I freaked the f*** out and went to the ER, where they removed an ANT from my ear. They drowned it with lidocaine and sucked it out. Guys it was awful feeling a frickin bug in my ear. There are these ants living in my bedroom and I have no idea where they're coming from. Now every sensation I feel I freak out a little.

But I feel like people who have a light version wouldn't even bother to post in this subreddit. I really wonder. I feel like new people who are diagnosed, may get more freaked out than they should, because of course the people here will be ones who suffer from more symptoms or stronger symptoms. Its like reading reviews for products online.....people with good experiences don't bother to write reviews, while people who hate the product are more likely to write a review. I wish people who had light versions of MS posted more. People like my aunt. Who you wouldn't even know had MS unless she told you. Or people who have had little to no relapses after finding the right DMD. I think it would be great to hear those stories. Espeicially for people who are newly diagnosed. I can't lie, this subreddit drives my anxiety through the roof! My aunt has such a calm version of MS. And has for years. So I look at her, and feel optimistic. But then ill browse this sub for a few minutes, and I'm scared I won't feel my body in a few months. Please no doom and gloom comments. I don't wanna hear ""oh in a few years you'll feel horrible"".

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4717797418333410323/Relapse-question	Relapse question	"Hi all,   Long time lurker, first time poster. I am a 32 y/o F, dx'd with RRMS in 2014 (with cervical spine involvment as well as optic involvement). I have been taking Gilenya every other night due to side effects (severe fatigue, general un-ease).   The reason I'm posting is because I have been experiencing some new symptoms over the course of the past week- 2 weeks. I'll start at the beginning and I am so grateful for anyone who will bear with me while I tell this story. Two weeks ago, on a Saturday, I was walking down the stairs in my house and my left leg kind of ""gave out"" underneath me which caused me to land kind of hard on my right ankle. I didn't think too much of it but as the days went on, then by Wednesday I noticed that my left leg just generally felt weaker than my right leg did but not weak enough to stop me from walking or functioning or living my life etc etc. I called my neuro's office and left them a message that day since it had been more than 24 hours that I was symptomatic. I did not receive a call back from my neuro until Tuesday of next week and in the meantime the weakness did not worsen but it also did not improve - so I thought okay, maybe this isn't all that serious? My neuro's NP called me that Tuesday and was ambivalent regarding starting steroids but said that we should probably just start oral steroids to be safe since it's kind of hard to know if this is a full blown relapse or some residual issue or pseudoexacerbation. This morning I wake up and the leg is the same, not worse, not better. Still fairly weak but more of an annoyance. I also noticed that my left arm started to have the same exact feeling in my left leg. Like, I picked up my cell phone in my left hand and it felt way heavier than it felt in my right hand. I am trying to decipher if this is a full blown relapse or something smaller. Any ideas/ advice/ thoughts would be much appreciated. Keep in mind I will be calling my neuro's office first thing tomorrow morning because I kind of feel like I'd rather just start with IV steroids instead if this is a relapse.   Thank you in advance for your help!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4717797418334019549/I-had-an-oddly-relaxing-day-today.-All-thanks-to-MS.	I had an oddly relaxing day today. All thanks to MS.	I did not expect today to be as awesome as it was. I honestly thought it was going to be stressful. My day started with being able to sleep in because I had to take the day off from work to go to a bunch of appointments all directly related to my MS. That right there was awesome. I'm usually up at 5:30. Instead, I got to sleep until 7. (FYI-A lot of what made today awesome involves sleep. It's kind of a theme in my life right now.)   I was up a 7 and out the door at 7:30 to get an MRI. I've had many MRIs in the past 18 years. I think it's somewhere around 15 MRI's. I don't think I know many people who would be able to say they found getting and MRI to be relaxing, but I fell asleep while I was in there. That was my first nap of the day and it happened before 9 AM.   After my MRI, I had to go get a Tysabri infusion. I usually get my infusions on Fridays at the end of the day. I'm usually rushing there after work. The place where I get my infusions is about an hour from where I work, so getting there is always stressful. Today, however, I didn't have to stress about getting there just in time. My appointment was scheduled in the middle of the day, so I didn't feel rushed at all. In fact, I was early. They got me right in. And I promptly fell asleep for the next 2 hours.   I then drove back home and hung out with my dogs for a little while before going to get a massage. MS only gives me a few problems. Fatigue (see my comments about sleeping) and muscle spasms. My right shoulder has been a hot mess for a while. I got a massage a couple weeks ago, and it helped. But I needed more. This woman worked on my shoulder almost exclusively for almost an hour. I didn't fall asleep, but I was in that weird in between state that's almost better than sleep.   I picked up some Chinese food on my way home and settled in for the evening. This disease sucks. But, today was kind of nice. 	1	1	I|had|an|oddly|relaxing|day|today|.|All|thanks|to|MS|.

I really want to help her and I couldnt find anything online so right now I'm trying to make a wrist brace that has a movable arm piece attached that can provide secondary support for toothbrushes, utensils, and pencils for her. Does anyone suffer from similar symptoms and could help me make sure this works for my sister or see themselves needing a device like this? Her birthday is in a month and I'm looking to see if this could actually help her.

Never thought it was going to happen to me. Been on meds for years. Was told that the meds can prevent SPMS until late 70s or longer. When I was diagnosed with SPMS, I was told it's nothing I have done wrong; it just happens to some. So far, nothing has really changed. Except when I get hot I cant walk very well. Or very far. Other than that I am still working. No other symptoms. I go on new meds soon. Ocrevus. Supposed to be the shit. Told it could also help with the spasticity in my legs. Feeling quite down right now. Trying to get the positivity back with all the news on remylination trials. Hope everyone, new or old to this crap disease is doing well. Keep smiling ! Dont let the fucker win.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4717505862577469528/New-to-this---advice-welcome	New to this - advice welcome	Hi. I am new to this, and pretty terrified right now but don't really know who else to talk to about what's going on with me. To be clear, I haven't been diagnosed with anything, but I have a long history of issues and doctors visits. I'm 28 years old and looking for advice about tests I should request, avenues I should take, basically someone to tell me I'm not crazy. My symptoms stem back about 6 years. Started with my hair falling out and chronic diarrhea. Like couldn't keep any foods down for more than 15 min (sorry, TMI). Went through several colonoscopies, but no one found anything. Nada. Zilch. Over the past few years I've developed an allergic reaction to 4 antibiotics. And about two years ago I started having issues with my bladder. Going to the bathroom 4 times a night. UTI like urgency all the time, but no pain. Had a cystoscopy, but once again, everything is normal. And there are a million non descriptive rsymptoms in between, rashes, ulcers, stomach aches, etc. Started having severe neck pain this January. Felt like throwing out my neck. Crick in the neck, can't move side to side. Then progressed to numbness and tingling in hands and feet at night. Had an MRI on my cervical spine, but everything seems normal. Physical therapy was prescribed. However, doctor did mention it could be an autoimmune disease and had me get bloodwork. I came out with all normal labs, except for a positive ANA test with a speckled pattern. Have an appointment scheduled with a rheumatologist, but they are booked until April. Most recently about 3 weeks ago I started getting severe cramping in my legs at night. Numb feet when I wake up. Stabbing pains in my thighs. Pins and needles. Muscle spasms in my legs non stop. It's keeping me up at night, and basically waking me up in the middle of the night in severe pain. Feels like restless leg syndrome, but worse, way worse. I also had 2 migraines with aura this month as well. To be clear, I have never had a migraine before. No amount of stretches are fixing my issue, and It's no longer happening just at night. Seems to be getting worse by the day. I have just been given a referral to a neurologist, but once again have to wait until the end of April. Am I on the right track? Are there certain tests I should be requesting? At first I thought maybe lupus was a possibility, but with the recent leg issue I'm thinking more along the lines of MS. Although I don't want to self diagnose, I know there is something wrong with me and I need my doctors to start digging deeper. Have you had any of these symptoms? Any help here is appreciated:). 	1	0	New|to|this|-|advice|welcome	Hi|.|I|am|new|to|this|,|and|pretty|terrified|right|now|but|don't|really|know|who|else|to|talk|to|about|what's|going|on|with|me|.|To|be|clear|,|I|haven't|been|diagnosed|with|anything|,|but|I|have|a|long|history|of|issues|and|doctors|visits|.|I'm|28|years|old|and|looking|for|advice|about|tests|I|should|request|,|avenues|I|should|take|,|basically|someone|to|tell|me|I'm|not|crazy|.|My|symptoms|stem|back|about|6|years|.|Started|with|my|hair|falling|out|and|chronic|diarrhea|.|Like|couldn't|keep|any|foods|down|for|more|than|15|min|(|sorry|,|TMI|)|.|Went|through|several|colonoscopies|,|but|no|one|found|anything|.|Nada|.|Zilch|.|Over|the|past|few|years|I've|developed|an|allergic|reaction|to|4|antibiotics|.|And|about|two|years|ago|I|started|having|issues|with|my|bladder|.|Going|to|the|bathroom|4|times|a|night|.|UTI|like|urgency|all|the|time|,|but|no|pain|.|Had|a|cystoscopy|,|but|once|again|,|everything|is|normal|.|And|there|are|a|million|non|descriptive|rsymptoms|in|between|,|rashes|,|ulcers|,|stomach|aches|,|etc|.|Started|having|severe|neck|pain|this|January|.|Felt|like|throwing|out|my|neck|.|Crick|in|the|neck|,|can't|move|side|to|side|.|Then|progressed|to|numbness|and|tingling|in|hands|and|feet|at|night|.|Had|an|MRI|on|my|cervical|spine|,|but|everything|seems|normal|.|Physical|therapy|was|prescribed|.|However|,|doctor|did|mention|it|could|be|an|autoimmune|disease|and|had|me|get|bloodwork|.|I|came|out|with|all|normal|labs|,|except|for|a|positive|ANA|test|with|a|speckled|pattern|.|Have|an|appointment|scheduled|with|a|rheumatologist|,|but|they|are|booked|until|April|.|Most|recently|about|3|weeks|ago|I|started|getting|severe|cramping|in|my|legs|at|night|.|Numb|feet|when|I|wake|up|.|Stabbing|pains|in|my|thighs|.|Pins|and|needles|.|Muscle|spasms|in|my|legs|non|stop|.|It's|keeping|me|up|at|night|,|and|basically|waking|me|up|in|the|middle|of|the|night|in|severe|pain|.|Feels|like|restless|leg|syndrome|,|but|worse|,|way|worse|.|I|also|had|2|migraines|with|aura|this|month|as|well|.|To|be|clear|,|I|have|never|had|a|migraine|before|.|No|amount|of|stretches|are|fixing|my|issue|,|and|It's|no|longer|happening|just|at|night|.|Seems|to|be|getting|worse|by|the|day|.|I|have|just|been|given|a|referral|to|a|neurologist|,|but|once|again|have|to|wait|until|the|end|of|April|.|Am|I|on|the|right|track|?|Are|there|certain|tests|I|should|be|requesting|?|At|first|I|thought|maybe|lupus|was|a|possibility|,|but|with|the|recent|leg|issue|I'm|thinking|more|along|the|lines|of|MS|.|Although|I|don't|want|to|self|diagnose|,|I|know|there|is|something|wrong|with|me|and|I|need|my|doctors|to|start|digging|deeper|.|Have|you|had|any|of|these|symptoms|?|Any|help|here|is|appreciated|:)|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4717325326748974480/how-to-proceed?	how to proceed?	Hi everyone,   31/M here and seeking your advice on getting a referral for a neurologist from my primary care physician, who, because I have HMO health insurance, pretty much controls my access to specialists.   Right after a new years' drinking binge I woke up with both of my feet tingling and numb, and it lasted for a couple of days. One of my fingers and one of my toes (each on my right side) had seemed to have slightly reduced sensation for a couple of months prior, so I googled around and figured there could be some neurological issue and started becoming increasingly concerned about MS specifically. I went to my primary care doctor in mid-January and he ordered an EMG of the affected (my right side) arm and leg. Came back normal, and the neurologist performing it interestingly said it would be useless in diagnosing issues of the small sensory nerves (minor peripheral neuropathy) of the extremities or the spinal cord and brain (MS), but performed it anyways to keep the diagnostic process moving along.   Over the past couple of months since then, the feeling of reduced sensation spread to my left thumb and right middle finger and I occasionally feel burning on a patch of my left arm for a day or two at a time and a cold, skin crawling sensation on the left side of my scalp for an hour or two at a time. I'm also short of breath a lot of the time and feel aches in the left side of my chest. I also have to pee pretty frequently and urgently but that has been kind of a thing for years and I do consume a lot of caffeine and some alcohol every day, in addition to drinking lots of water. I experience some degree of anxiety over a stressful job situation and these health symptoms on a daily basis. I also have normal B vitamin and other blood panel results as of November because I had a nutritional panel done back then due to my vegetarian diet. I also have been having a lot of muscle twitches lately (fasciculations) all over my body and transient electrical current/bubbling feelings in my toes in both feet.   I just saw my primary care physician again and he diagnosed me with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, prescribed Lexapro, told me (and this is pretty weird) that the EMG would rule out all issues involving the body's nerves AND spinal cord INCLUDING MS (which I've become increasingly concerned about over the past couple months) and basically that I just need to calm down because there's nothing serious on the table. I told him I understood anxiety was clearly a major part of what I was experiencing lately, but also that I would like to do diligence by getting a once-over from a neurologist and that I wouldn't feel psychologically comfortable/calm until MS was ruled out. He told me to take the anxiety meds and come back in three months.   My question for you all is, what can I do now? Should I switch primary care doctors in light of this clearly wrong information about the EMG ruling out MS and this guy's refusal to refer me to a neurologist for a simple examination after months of anxiety about these symptoms? Should I attempt to see a neurologist out of pocket? Any advice is appreciated. 	1	0	how|to|proceed|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4717145190130020235/How-concerned-should-I-be?	How concerned should I be?	Hi. I'm 19 years old, and I've been dealing with a strange diagnosis process since November of last year. It all started when I was feeling extremely fatigued. That was sort of the first of a long line of symptoms. What really started my concern was when I was fiddling with my old turntable and got a pretty good shock. I wouldn't say the shock did much to me except stress me out. My muscles got tense, I got dizzy, my heart started pounding, I got a splitting migraine, and felt pins and needles throughout my legs and arms. I've been tested for Hyperthyroidism as well as heart conditions since. To save time, I'll just make a list below of all the symptoms I've been experiencing. - Muscle pain (everywhere) - Leg pain - Difficulty walking - Sudden feeling of cold rushing water/ pins and needles in my legs (also sometimes in my arms) - Sudden, intense bone pain - Back pain - Muscle twitches (mainly in legs and feet) - Sudden numbness of toes - Difficulty sleeping (often because of the twitches) - Fatigue - Irregular weight fluctuations (130 low-145-155 high) - Difficulty breathing (after walking up stairs) - Intense memory problems - Completely forgetting a friend's name (until explicitly told) - Feeling of confusion mid sentence - Feeling of confusion when entering a room (“why am I in here?”) - Tremor in hands - Heart Palpitations - Sudden accelerated heart rate -Chest pain (Sudden) - Almost constant chest pain (on both sides, on front and back, as well) If this seems like a lot, you're right. However, I feel every single one of these eight out of ten days. Additionally, I find that the symptoms pile on with every week. The confusion and memory loss is something I've just started experiencing as of last week. Another thing to note is that I find that I have these sort of flare ups where the worst of my symptoms happen all at once at about double the strength. That happens maybe once every two weeks. I've been to so many doctors that the bills are piling up and I can only afford to make a few more guesses. So I guess I'm posting this because a few around me have suggested that I look into it, and I would be very interested and grateful to hear all of your thoughts about Multiple Sclerosis as a possibility to look into. Thanks. 	1	0	How|concerned|should|I|be|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4716865488271015798/Just-needed-some-support-today-from-people-who-know-what-Im-going-through.	Just needed some support today from people who know what I’m going through.	I am a 36/F who was diagnosed 13 years ago, however, they think I might of had it at 11 when I was diagnosed with transverse myelitis. I have literally been on every medication, yet I still had really bad flare ups that left me with lasting effects. I was in a wheelchair for 3 years. I have spent the majority of my 20's in and out of hospitals and rehabs. I was told I shouldn't be walking today. So, back in October, I had to resort to using a wheelchair again. My doctor wanted to put me on Ocrevus, my last resort. If Ocrevus didn't work, he wanted to diagnose me with secondary progressive. I have been dreading this appointment for almost 6 months (I get my second infusion of Ocrevus soon). I started to try and walk on my treadmill, the same treadmill I learned how to walk again on. I run 5 days a week now. I lift weights. I can hold a yoga pose. I have visual muscles. I feel and look strong, rather than looking weak. I have not walked into a single piece of furniture in months. Last time my doctor saw me, I couldn't even complete the hallway walk test without falling. Today, I plan on surprising him with a handstand.

"My MS background: So I had my first relapse in May 2014 (about 2 months before my 25th), I presented oddly (single massive lesion on my C2 causing numbness from the collarbone down and the wicked MS hug. I was interstate at the time and really not happy with how they handled it (sure see you in 6 months), so I moved to my home state with my mum and got straight into a local Neuro who put me on Tecfidera before my second MRI. Second MRI confirmed MS with 2 brain lesions and 3 new spinal ones.   We stayed on Tec for 6 months while I went through intense physical and occupational therapy (I still have never gained feeling in my dominant hand so had to learn everything all over again). Eventually it showed Tec wasn't working so we moved to Tysabri and went through a bunch of alternate tests because I was presenting strangely with lesions (5 brain, 16 upper spine as of now). 11 months later, still no slowing so we moved to Lemtrada. Lemtrada failed 6 months after my second dose so I went back on Tysabri while we waited for Ocrevus to become available (I'm Australian). Lemtrada apparently changed something as I have been new lesion free for more than 18 months (though after a huge day at a friend's wedding yesterday I think I'm having a flare up :( ).   My question: Is anyone else part of a ""family cluster"" where one or more immediate family members have MS?   My mother was diagnosed back in '98, my father in '08, my maternal aunt in '09. There are also 2 second cousins on my mother's side with MS (both male, one deceased). I have been transferred to a Professor to manage me and he is doing a big research project this year on MS genetics and I was curious who else out there is is in a similar boat. As far as I know, we are the only cluster in my state (Victoria) but I'm not sure about the rest of Australia. I have previously heard of some in Canada.   Out of my parents, aunt and I, I am by far the worst off progression and symptom wise, so obviously I got the dodgey genes haha. I am not in a wheelchair yet, but I struggle with a lot of bodily and muscular functions due to the spinal lesions. "	1	1	"Any|other|""|Family|Clusters|""|out|there|?"

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4716362743905145926/Curious-about-your-experiences-and-looking-for-advice-about-medication-changes	Curious about your experiences and looking for advice about medication changes	My mom was diagnosed with MS (relapsing remitting) roughly two years ago. In that time she did all the tests and scans. She had a few lesions on her brain but no lesions on her spine. She was prescribed Copaxone, but switched to the generic version at some point. She's been on it for a little over a year. The time of taking meds doesn't match up exactly with diagnoses because there was some back and forth from the neurologist to confirm it was truly MS. Anyways, she has the occasional side effects form taking generic copaxone such a chills, and flu like feeling or burning at injection site. On three occasions though, she had a very awful reaction in the form of some crazy insanely intense pain in her legs shortly after taking her shots. First reaction occurred a several months ago. Then she had another reaction the previous Friday (3/1) which she said was nothing like she barely mentioned it to anyone. But the worst and longest one occurred this past Wednesday (3/6). It came in waves and she went through cycles of the most heart wrenching sobbing I've ever heard from her in all my years. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? She said it is hard to describe but something like an intense burning horribly intense pain that happens right under her knee caps. She had a scheduled MRI this week, and to top off this unfortunate week, it was found that another lesion has appeared. Previous to this it seemed that her initial lesions had “healed” (I'm not sure of exactly what that means but there didn't seem to be extra deterioration until recently). So now her neurologist feels that with the new lesion, and these side effects that it might be time to try a new medication. He has left it up to her essentially. Whether she wants to do an infusion or try another pill. There were some he ruled out due to causing depression and fatigue (which she already has a history of outside of this) and another med that would cause increased heart rate (she has hard high blood pressure and also has diabetes that we're doing our best to manage). My mom seems to be leaning toward Tecfidera. But Ocrevus is also on the table (provided JC testing comes back negative). Any suggestions, advice or positive vibes would be immensely appreciated! I know that MS and every person's experiences with medication and side effects is different but we'd still appreciate hearing your experiences.

She is my best friend and my very first thought was an image of her in a wheelchair at 40. However she is lucky (relatively), she has Remitting and Relapsing. She filled me in on what the doctor said and I have looked into it myself. It will suck, it will be inconvenient, she will have to make some life changes but apparently it is manageable. We talk daily and I am just trying to keep things normal, which I can tell she appreciates because the rest of our family is going crazy. That being said I was hoping I could get some advice from this community; either for myself or to pass along to my sister. She is a good shape, regularly exercises and eats well (however she's knows she will have to tweak her diet). Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I've always been proud of my sister but I am just now seeing how resilient and strong she is. 	1	1	My|sister|was|just|diagnosed|...

I've met a whole one person. - basically I look like I'm having a seizure, I have little/zero control over my body and I'm rattling but I'm generally aware ish. I suffer from them pretty badly when they arrive. Currently I'm 24hours into this bout. It's not quite the 2weeks solid but this is me with tegretol. But I've messed around with the baclofen dosage and tegretol timings. And bam. Gladly during the day today I've only had one major one. But last night was 2hours of the worst ones I get. My poor husband had to deal with headbutts and punches as my body was doing it's thing. I'm fully aware of what's going on, can even talk sort of through them at times. When I'm still breathing. I'm used to them at this point even if they suck and I feel more than defenseless during the big ones But still get embarrassed as all heck when the smaller ones happen around people. I'm glad my friends just deal with them even the worst ones. They take their play from my husband's reaction. But next weekend. We're seeing my husband's family. First time since ms properly took over. It's been a few years since we saw them. And just over a year since diagnosis (2years) since the new round of ms relapses took hold. I'm slightly terrified. We're away from home. With people I hardly know. Oh and this will be the first event where my husband will be attending as, well my husband. (Trans and now married). I'm slightly nervous if I have these fits kicking off, I'm gonna scare the family shirtless as it were... Don't know why. But I feel like. We'll bee the broken ones, in that family... My family, I don't much care plenty of us are broken and different and have our own struggles. But his family... While not perfect. Feels much like... I don't know. Yeah we'll be the broken ones, and one heck of sight for them to deal with.

Sadly, my neurologist isn't really up to speed on cannabis and MS, so until my prescription renewal, I don't really have anyone knowledgeable to ask. I asked in r/trees, but i'm likely to get as many jokes as actual answers there... I have a prescription for treating insomnia (pre ms diagnosis), and I realized that cannabis helps settle my legs (ms related) when i'm trying to sleep, but I can't figure out whether it's the THC or CBD (or combo) that may work best for that. Is there anyone here doing the same that could share what works for you, so that I can get a better idea of what might work best?

Talks of mortality, ect. This might be far fetched and out there, but I've been thinking about donating my body after I die. Mainly my brain. I don't think that time is coming anytime soon, but I've been doing some thinking lately and think it would be pretty cool to potentially take part in research. Especially if it's research on MS. I'm really just wondering if anyone here knows anything about it? Maybe even about an organization or research group that deals specifically with neurological/neuro-degenerative diseases? Or maybe some of you guys have thought about it as well? It's definitely something I will do extensive research on, but just wondering if anyone here has some input. I understand this is really pretty gruesome to think about, so I'm really sorry if I've offended anyone. 	1	1	Donating|body|..|er|brain|?|(|serious|)	Before|you|read|:|this|post|might|potentially|be|upsetting|to|some|people|.|Talks|of|mortality|,|ect|.|This|might|be|far|fetched|and|out|there|,|but|I've|been|thinking|about|donating|my|body|after|I|die|.|Mainly|my|brain|.|I|don't|think|that|time|is|coming|anytime|soon|,|but|I've|been|doing|some|thinking|lately|and|think|it|would|be|pretty|cool|to|potentially|take|part|in|research|.|Especially|if|it's|research|on|MS|.|I'm|really|just|wondering|if|anyone|here|knows|anything|about|it|?|Maybe|even|about|an|organization|or|research|group|that|deals|specifically|with|neurological|/|neuro-degenerative|diseases|?|Or|maybe|some|of|you|guys|have|thought|about|it|as|well|?|It's|definitely|something|I|will|do|extensive|research|on|,|but|just|wondering|if|anyone|here|has|some|input|.|I|understand|this|is|really|pretty|gruesome|to|think|about|,|so|I'm|really|sorry|if|I've|offended|anyone|.

In a new study, researchers say there was no significant increase in relapse rate after childbirth for women with MS.	https://www.healthline.com/health-news/women-with-ms-may-not-need-to-worry-about-flare-ups-after-pregnancy Multiple Sclerosis Relapses Don't Necessarily Occur After Pregnancy In a new study, researchers say there was no significant increase in relapse rate after childbirth for women with MS. Pregnancy may not cause multiple sclerosis (MS) to worsen as previously thought. For the past 20 years, women with MS were told that while pregnancy might help prevent relapses, those relapses often got worse after childbirth. However, researchers say in a study released today that they discovered the disease didn't show increased relapse activity after a woman has given birth. The research team was headed by Dr. Annette Langer-Gould, a clinical assistant professor of neurology at the University of Southern California (USC) Keck School of Medicine as well as an affiliated investigator in neurology with Kaiser Permanente Research. “This is a super interesting study,” Bruce Bebo, PhD, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, told Healthline. “We have had this dogma for a long time,” said Bebo. “Women with MS showed an exacerbated rate of relapses after pregnancy, but Dr. Langer-Gould questioned this and found in this preliminary study a different result.” Previous studies occurred before current disease-modifying treatments. There are now 15 such treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Almost 1 million people in the United States are estimated to be living with MS. Of these, about 70 percent are women. What the study found The objective of the recent study was to investigate what happens to women with MS after giving birth. Researchers looked at the risk of relapses and identified potentially modifiable risk factors. This population study looked at 466 pregnancies from 375 women in the years 2008 to 2016. The records were taken from the Kaiser Permanente Southern and Northern California databases. The participants were surveyed about treatments, breastfeeding, and relapses. “This study provides an important update on previous data, which had indicated that women with MS were more likely to have a relapse in the first three to six months postpartum, with that risk being higher for patients with more active disease before pregnancy,” Dr. Barbara Giesser, professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and clinical director of the UCLA MS program, told Healthline. Of the women in the study, 38 percent weren't on any treatment in the year prior to conception, while 15 percent had clinically isolated syndrome and 8 percent relapsed during pregnancy. No increase in relapses postpartum were observed, although the authors point out that some of the women had only had a single episode. About one-third of the women breastfed exclusively, which seemed to reduce the relapse rate. “This is good news for women with MS who wish to have children, and larger population-based studies of this type are encouraged,” noted Giesser. The study's significance Immune mechanisms are triggered during pregnancy to keep a woman's body from rejecting the fetus. This mechanism is also responsible for suppressing the immune system responsible for MS relapses. “These results are exciting, as MS is more common among women of childbearing age than in any other group,” Langer-Gould said in a statement. “This shows us that women with MS today can have children, breastfeed, and resume their treatment without experiencing an increased risk of relapses during the postpartum period,” she added. “The results are somewhat preliminary and not definitive,” noted Bebo. “But it provides an important piece of information that adds to our knowledge for MS and pregnancy, before and after.” The authors report the lack of rebound disease activity in the early postpartum period is likely due to a combination of the participants in a population-based setting, inclusion of women diagnosed after a single relapse, and high rates of breastfeeding. “There were not a lot of people in the study that were on the stronger DMTs, so it may be skewed to a more calm version of disease,” cautioned Bebo, “There wasn't a lot of exacerbation postpartum.” “We do not know how certain DMTs will affect pregnancy,” Bebo said. He emphasized the importance of pregnant women with MS contacting their healthcare provider as soon as possible to us a shared-decision approach to treatment. “People should have all the information in making family decisions, and this is something that can help,” said Bebo. “This information is helpful, but everyone needs to evaluate their own circumstance with their healthcare provider to make informed decisions on how to proceed.” Editor's note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

By Robert Preidt TUESDAY, March 5, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Popping open too many sodas or other sweetened beverages each day might worsen symptoms for people with multiple sclerosis, new research suggests. It's important to note that the small study could only point to an association -- it couldn't prove that high soda intake causes MS symptoms to get worse. But study author Dr. Elisa Meier-Gerdingh said it couldn't hurt to cut back on sugary drinks. The results ""need to be confirmed by larger studies that follow people over a long period of time,"" said Meier-Gerdingh, of St. Josef Hospital in Bochum, Germany. Still, ""we do know that sodas have no nutritional value and people with MS may want to consider reducing or eliminating them from their diet,"" she said. Her team is slated to present the findings in Philadelphia at the upcoming annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) in May. The German researchers tracked symptoms for 135 people with MS. All provided data on their diet, and they also had their levels of disability assessed on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 representing no symptoms and 10 representing death due to MS. Thirty of the patients had severe disability, the researchers found. There was no link between the patients' overall diet and their level of disability. There was a link, however, to a specific type of food: sugar-sweetened beverages like sodas. MS patients who consumed the largest amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages -- an average of 290 calories' worth of such drinks, or about two cans per day -- were five times more likely to have severe disability than people who seldom drank sugar-sweetened beverages, Meier-Gerdingh's group reported. Of the 34 people who drank the most of these beverages (top group), 12 had severe disability, compared to 4 of the 34 with the lowest consumption (bottom group). The average disability score was 4.1 in the high-consuming group and 3.4 in the bottom group, the study found.

I had the flu a few weeks ago and the joint pain was so horrible and the bottoms of my feet were so itchy. After my fever went away, my legs feel like I have weights around my ankles, my feet won't stop tingling, and my toes keep going numb. The bottom of my mouth under my tongue also feels numb, and when I do things with my right hand it doesn't ""feel"" right anymore. This has been going on for about two weeks. I have felt this way before in high school (around 10 years ago) where my legs went heavy and I had the tingling for 3 months. My mom has MS so the dr did take me seriously back then, but my MRI was clear. They blamed it on Raynaud's syndrome. I felt like some of my family thought I was making it up back then. I don't know. I'm so scared to go back to the dr's about this, I don't know if I should go. Do lesions develop later in life or are they always there?

I'm currently having my first relapse since being diagnosed in Dec. 2018. My neurologist said that IV steroids are an option, but that all they do is speed up the process. They don't reduce the amount of potential damage. What are everyone's opinions on IV steroids? When I talked to him a couple of days ago I opted to not do the steroids due to the info that he gave me. I woke up this morning and along with the numb/burning right foot and balance issues that started Saturday, I also have a weak left leg now. So walking is awkward and going down stairs is difficult. Update: Talked to my GO this morning. He suggested oral prednisone 20mg for 9 days. 3 today and going down to 1 a day for the last 3 days. He felt the infusion was overkill, but that we should try something just to take the edge off the symptoms. 	1	1	Opinions|on|taking|steroids|for|a|relapse|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4715274353487691295/Should-I-be-very-worried?	Should I be very worried?	So first of all let me introduce myself. I am a 13 year old male and i have been really worried lately that I might have MS. First of all, my medical history is pretty clear, except i had one seizure as a little kid. Now, my symptoms. At around beginning of December, i had started to feel numbness, tingling, and weakness along my forearm radiating to my pinky. I brushed it off as a pinched nerve, and eventually, it went away. But as of January 1st, i have been experiencing weird things all over my body. One of my biggest concerns was this weird tightening and then relaxing of a tendon in my lower thigh (probably a spasm). I searched it up and i saw injury, mineral and vitamin deficiencies, stress, or exercise could be the cause. I let time pass and the same spasm kept on happening. At around the beginning of February, i had a blood test and a urine sample done, and a physical exam done. All the tests came out perfectly fine. Fast forward a week from those tests, i woke up feeling really sluggish and just a gut feeling overall. I then tried to do some stretches to make the feeling go away, but then i realized that in my thigh stretches. I could only move my thigh back a few inches before it felt really tight. Then throughout the whole day i felt a series of symptoms. All of those symptoms right here: •sharp jabbing pain next to my jaw muscle that stopped me from chewing.( later realize it could be tregiminal neuralgia) •tremor whenever i slowly move a limb on all of my limbs in my body, including my back and abdomen •electric like pain that shoots from the side of my ankle to the bottom of my foot when i kick. •bad cognitive function. He then called me again, and i knew he was calling me, but i still didn't move, he then came over and tapped on my shoulder and i immediately shot back into function. I was really confused that whole day, because i could here him calling me and i just didn't seem properly function.) There is no family history of any diseases except scoliosis, which my dad has, but i now that scoliosis doesn't cause cognitive problems, or bad headaches. My parents say they'll make another appointment to see what they can do about my symptoms and hopefully a diagnosis. So should i be very worried about MS, and also, what were your guy's first symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? I would love some feedback. Thank You! 	1	0	Should|I|be|very|worried|?

Those diagnosed early in life - how was your first year after being diagnosed?	Don't mean to exclude anyone just want a bit of insight! Been very stressed lately, currently having my 3rd relapse in 6.5 months, I was diagnosed in September after losing mobility of my left leg, got mobility back after steroids, was good for a few months, had my second relapse since being diagnosed in January and was hospitalized, had 3 new spinal lesions, and just yesterday saw my neurologist because I'm numb from my breasts down and am losing mobility in both of my feet. He said this is definitely a new relapse and the new symptoms indicate new lesions, getting new MRIs next week. Neuro wanted me to be admitted again to do steroids via IV for the next 5 days but I begged to steroids orally because I don't want to miss work again, as I just had to be out a week due to hospitalization from a flare up in January. I've been on Copaxone since December and yesterday me and my neurologist decided it was time to say goodbye. After much discussion we both agreed Ocrevus was a good next step. Doing my blood work tomorrow and waiting for insurance approval, I'm feeling nervous but I think Ocrevus would be the best thing for me at this point. Anyways sorry for droning on, what I really want to know is how other people's disease was in the first year after they were diagnosed. I feel like I'm having an exceptionally terrible 6 months since being diagnosed and I'm feeling so stressed about it, I wanted to hear other people's stories so I could get a better feel of things. I know it differs from person to person, but I'm just worried. I graduated college last May and was a D1 Track and Field runner for all 4 years, I ran long distance so running a lot has been very special to me for my entire life and ever since my diagnosis I haven't been able to do what I love the most because every time I think I'm recovering from a relapse then something new happens. I hope anyone else having a particular difficult time in their disease course stays strong and I hope things will get better as soon as possible for all of us much love. 	1	1	Those|diagnosed|early|in|life|-|how|was|your|first|year|after|being|diagnosed|?

I read - briefly so I could be ill informed - that it's because they don't know what causes MS. Then I googled whether MS can be sexually transmitted. Has anyone heard this before?

Context: CIS diagnosed 2015, 2 lesions incomplete C3 and C6 spinal, varying subcortical hyperintensities. Parttime wheelchair user, experiencing progressively worsening symptoms with very little remitting. Standing descriptor for issues: chronic brain inflammation, with corticobasal syndrome (not corticobasal degeneration) movement disorder. I had a neuro review, and there was an MS nurse in attendance at this appointment. She wrote down symptoms and/or took notes throughout the appointment. I have not been formally diagnosed with MS as my scans over the past 4 years have not shown enough change to warrant the diagnosis, or have been unclear. I have also been prescribed Amantadine for fatigue - this seems to be licensed for fatigue in MS. As it has been so long without a diagnosis, I am hesitant and questioning of every single appointment with my neuro - but, this isn't routine to have an MS nurse and I am now reading far too much into her presence, and the prescription of a drug usually used in management of MS seems like a grasp towards diagnosis. (However, Amatadine is also used in Parkinsonian disorders/Parkinsons - and one of the side effects I was told to watch out for happens in folk with Parkinsons. So I guess we're between the 2 in differential?) Maybe this is optimistic? Guess we'll see what the next scan says and where to go from there. Limboland is hard going. 	1	0	MS|nurse|at|neuro|appointment|?

It doesn't say anything else. My CRP and ESR is high since EVER but all other things in blood and csf are normal. And I also have (apparently) ""iron deficiency anemia"" that is not and can't be corrected with ANY dose of iron.   I thought maybe you guys can tell me something about it. whether this means something. like these oligoclonal band readings being somehow pointing to possible MS, for instance.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4714920464891648804/Waiting-for-MRI	Waiting for MRI	Hi everyone...I'm new here. I've been having symptoms that haven't felt quite right to me for a long while now (about two years), but I have chronic complex migraines that are often hemiplegic so I have learned to “talk myself off the ledge”, as it were. Also I've experienced some pretty dismissive doctors in the past (I have endometriosis and it took over 7 years to get a proper diagnosis for it, during which time I suffered a lot of pain and nearly died from a ruptured appendix that was fused to my abdominal wall with adhesions). Anyway, I've been having left-side numbness/weakness from head to toe, and it hasn't gone away. I'm also unable to pick up my foot when I walk now. I saw my GP yesterday and he suggested an MRI to check for MS or if I may have had a stroke with my complex migraines. I've read a lot of posts on here and a lot of the symptoms I've experienced like the crushing feeling in my upper rib cage that I figured was costochondritis (it starts with some tightness and pains in the sides and then kind of moves all around until I feel like I'm in a tight band and my heart starts beating hard but not faster, and I have trouble breathing...it's hard to explain. Sometimes I get it in my neck/throat area too), the creepy crawly feeling on my leg and the total one-sided numbness and weakness, the pain behind my eye... I don't want to jump the gun or anything before I have results but it seems to fit. I'm also having a big problem with heat intolerance, and when I get hot my symptoms get worse. I appreciate any helpful advice or just kind words anyone has for me. They still have to authorize the MRI through my insurance so I don't know how long I'll be waiting, but I'm getting worried, even though I know there's nothing I can do but wait. I just know with this type of thing going on there is something wrong. 	1	0	Waiting|for|MRI	Hi|everyone|...|I'm|new|here|.|I've|been|having|symptoms|that|haven't|felt|quite|right|to|me|for|a|long|while|now|(|about|two|years|)|,|but|I|have|chronic|complex|migraines|that|are|often|hemiplegic|so|I|have|learned|to|“|talk|myself|off|the|ledge|”|,|as|it|were|.|Also|I've|experienced|some|pretty|dismissive|doctors|in|the|past|(|I|have|endometriosis|and|it|took|over|7|years|to|get|a|proper|diagnosis|for|it|,|during|which|time|I|suffered|a|lot|of|pain|and|nearly|died|from|a|ruptured|appendix|that|was|fused|to|my|abdominal|wall|with|adhesions|)|.|Anyway|,|I've|been|having|left-side|numbness|/|weakness|from|head|to|toe|,|and|it|hasn't|gone|away|.|I'm|also|unable|to|pick|up|my|foot|when|I|walk|now|.|I|saw|my|GP|yesterday|and|he|suggested|an|MRI|to|check|for|MS|or|if|I|may|have|had|a|stroke|with|my|complex|migraines|.|I've|read|a|lot|of|posts|on|here|and|a|lot|of|the|symptoms|I've|experienced|like|the|crushing|feeling|in|my|upper|rib|cage|that|I|figured|was|costochondritis|(|it|starts|with|some|tightness|and|pains|in|the|sides|and|then|kind|of|moves|all|around|until|I|feel|like|I'm|in|a|tight|band|and|my|heart|starts|beating|hard|but|not|faster|,|and|I|have|trouble|breathing|...|it's|hard|to|explain|.|Sometimes|I|get|it|in|my|neck|/|throat|area|too|)|,|the|creepy|crawly|feeling|on|my|leg|and|the|total|one-sided|numbness|and|weakness|,|the|pain|behind|my|eye|...|I|don't|want|to|jump|the|gun|or|anything|before|I|have|results|but|it|seems|to|fit|.|I'm|also|having|a|big|problem|with|heat|intolerance|,|and|when|I|get|hot|my|symptoms|get|worse|.|I|appreciate|any|helpful|advice|or|just|kind|words|anyone|has|for|me|.|They|still|have|to|authorize|the|MRI|through|my|insurance|so|I|don't|know|how|long|I'll|be|waiting|,|but|I'm|getting|worried|,|even|though|I|know|there's|nothing|I|can|do|but|wait|.|I|just|know|with|this|type|of|thing|going|on|there|is|something|wrong|.

[here is the study](https://actrims.confex.com/actrims/2019/meetingapp. cgi/Paper/3996) https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2019/03/05/actrims2019-bacterial-epsilon-toxin-triggers-ms-disease-rodents/ Bacterial Epsilon Toxin Found in MS Patients Triggers MS Disease Features in Rodents MARCH 5, 2019 BY JONATHAN GRINSTEIN IN NEWS. The levels of epsilon toxin are increased in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and its presence in laboratory rodents replicated some aspects of disease activity, according to data presented at the 4th Annual Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum. The researchers suggested that the epsilon toxin and the bacteria that produces it, called Clostridium perfringens, may play a role in MS development. ACTRIMS ran from Feb. 28 to March 2 in Dallas, Texas. The data was presented at the meeting by Jennifer Linden, PhD, from Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, in a poster titled “Clinical and Mechanistic Evidence for Clostridium perfringens Epsilon Toxin As an Environmental Trigger of Multiple Sclerosis.” Clostridium perfringens is a bacterium that is part of a family that synthesizes some of the most potent toxins, including tetanus and botulinum neurotoxins. These bacteria are found in all sorts of environments (i.e., decaying vegetation, soil, water) as long-lasting, quiescent (dormant) spores where they wait for an opportunity to infect livestock or humans. Clostridium perfringens produces the epsilon toxin (ETX), which has been suggested as a possible environmental agent linked to new MS lesion formation. Researchers from Weill Cornell wanted to better understand the relationship between Clostridium perfringens ETX and MS. They asked two questions: do MS patients have increased exposure to this bacterium and related ETX, and does ETX-administration mimic MS disease activity features in rodents? When looking at fecal — stool — samples of MS patients, researchers found that about one in four (21%) were positive for ETX-producing bacteria, whereas samples from healthy controls (with no MS) were all negative for the bacteria. When looking at peripheral blood components — circulating red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets — researchers found increased exposure and levels of ETX in MS samples versus healthy control subjects. Then, using laboratory rodents, the team found that ETX administration resulted in disease activity similar to MS. Prominent features that were mimicked upon ETX administration included blood-brain barrier permeability and focal demyelination (loss of myelin, the protective coat of neurons). Based on the results, Linden concluded that “ETX replicate aspects of MS pathology in rodents,” and suggested that “EXT and the bacteria that produces it may be responsible for initiating and propagating disease activity in a subset of MS patients.” The team offered a hypothesis of how ETX causes demyelination in MS patients. According to them, “for our model of ETX-induced MS, we propose that ETX-producing bacteria colonize the human gastrointestinal tract, resulting in periodical blooms of exponential growth, leading to secretion of the toxin,” they wrote. Then, “activation of ETX induces intestinal permeability, a well-accepted but poorly understood process, allowing entry of the toxin into the bloodstream. Once in circulation, ETX specifically binds to the central nervous system microvasculature, causing blood-brain barrier permeability and allowing entry of the toxin into the brain parenchyma [cellular tissue]. Once in the brain, ETX specially kills mature oligodendrocytes [myelin-producing cells], leading to demyelination,” the team suggested. 	1	0	Bacterial|Epsilon|Toxin|Found|in|MS|Patients|Triggers|MS|Disease|Features|in|Rodents	another|theory|-|-|that|this|bacterial|toxin|MAY|spark|MS|in|a|subset|of|us|.|interesting|thread|to|follow|.|[|here|is|the|study|]|(|https://actrims.confex.com/actrims/2019/meetingapp|.|cgi|/|Paper|/|3996|)|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2019/03/05/actrims2019-bacterial-epsilon-toxin-triggers-ms-disease-rodents/|Bacterial|Epsilon|Toxin|Found|in|MS|Patients|Triggers|MS|Disease|Features|in|Rodents|MARCH|5|,|2019|BY|JONATHAN|GRINSTEIN|IN|NEWS|.|The|levels|of|epsilon|toxin|are|increased|in|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|patients|,|and|its|presence|in|laboratory|rodents|replicated|some|aspects|of|disease|activity|,|according|to|data|presented|at|the|4th|Annual|Americas|Committee|for|Treatment|and|Research|in|Multiple|Sclerosis|(|ACTRIMS|)|Forum|.|The|researchers|suggested|that|the|epsilon|toxin|and|the|bacteria|that|produces|it|,|called|Clostridium|perfringens|,|may|play|a|role|in|MS|development|.|ACTRIMS|ran|from|Feb|.|28|to|March|2|in|Dallas|,|Texas|.|The|data|was|presented|at|the|meeting|by|Jennifer|Linden|,|PhD|,|from|Weill|Cornell|Medical|College|,|New|York|,|in|a|poster|titled|“|Clinical|and|Mechanistic|Evidence|for|Clostridium|perfringens|Epsilon|Toxin|As|an|Environmental|Trigger|of|Multiple|Sclerosis|.|”|Clostridium|perfringens|is|a|bacterium|that|is|part|of|a|family|that|synthesizes|some|of|the|most|potent|toxins|,|including|tetanus|and|botulinum|neurotoxins|.|These|bacteria|are|found|in|all|sorts|of|environments|(|i|.|e|.|,|decaying|vegetation|,|soil|,|water|)|as|long-lasting|,|quiescent|(|dormant|)|spores|where|they|wait|for|an|opportunity|to|infect|livestock|or|humans|.|Clostridium|perfringens|produces|the|epsilon|toxin|(|ETX|)|,|which|has|been|suggested|as|a|possible|environmental|agent|linked|to|new|MS|lesion|formation|.|Researchers|from|Weill|Cornell|wanted|to|better|understand|the|relationship|between|Clostridium|perfringens|ETX|and|MS|.|They|asked|two|questions|:|do|MS|patients|have|increased|exposure|to|this|bacterium|and|related|ETX|,|and|does|ETX-administration|mimic|MS|disease|activity|features|in|rodents|?|When|looking|at|fecal|—|stool|—|samples|of|MS|patients|,|researchers|found|that|about|one|in|four|(|21|%|)|were|positive|for|ETX-producing|bacteria|,|whereas|samples|from|healthy|controls|(|with|no|MS|)|were|all|negative|for|the|bacteria|.|When|looking|at|peripheral|blood|components|—|circulating|red|blood|cells|,|white|blood|cells|,|and|platelets|—|researchers|found|increased|exposure|and|levels|of|ETX|in|MS|samples|versus|healthy|control|subjects|.|Then|,|using|laboratory|rodents|,|the|team|found|that|ETX|administration|resulted|in|disease|activity|similar|to|MS|.|Prominent|features|that|were|mimicked|upon|ETX|administration|included|blood-brain|barrier|permeability|and|focal|demyelination|(|loss|of|myelin|,|the|protective|coat|of|neurons|)|.|Based|on|the|results|,|Linden|concluded|that|“|ETX|replicate|aspects|of|MS|pathology|in|rodents|,|”|and|suggested|that|“|EXT|and|the|bacteria|that|produces|it|may|be|responsible|for|initiating|and|propagating|disease|activity|in|a|subset|of|MS|patients|.|”|The|team|offered|a|hypothesis|of|how|ETX|causes|demyelination|in|MS|patients|.|According|to|them|,|“|for|our|model|of|ETX-induced|MS|,|we|propose|that|ETX-producing|bacteria|colonize|the|human|gastrointestinal|tract|,|resulting|in|periodical|blooms|of|exponential|growth|,|leading|to|secretion|of|the|toxin|,|”|they|wrote|.|Then|,|“|activation|of|ETX|induces|intestinal|permeability|,|a|well-accepted|but|poorly|understood|process|,|allowing|entry|of|the|toxin|into|the|bloodstream|.|Once|in|circulation|,|ETX|specifically|binds|to|the|central|nervous|system|microvasculature|,|causing|blood-brain|barrier|permeability|and|allowing|entry|of|the|toxin|into|the|brain|parenchyma|[|cellular|tissue|]|.|Once|in|the|brain|,|ETX|specially|kills|mature|oligodendrocytes|[|myelin-producing|cells|]|,|leading|to|demyelination|,|”|the|team|suggested|.

I started to abuse it around 2016 by just taking more than prescribed. I went off of it cold turkey in November 2016. I quickly gained 20 pounds, felt depressed from the weight gain and very fatigued. I was under a lot of stress at work too. Then I started to experience tingling on one side of my body from my face down to my hands and feet. Sometimes my vision would go away for a few seconds before coming back. I felt confused all the time and slow to process. And again, fatigued. All of these symptoms lasted about 2 weeks before I finally decided to go to the hospital. I was home alone and starting to fear that I may be having a stroke. Long story short, they kept me over night, did an MRI and found out that I was pregnant and diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. I don't know what I want to ask... But had anyone experienced anything like this? Has anyone taken adderall and felt that it caused them to get multiple sclerosis? I started to take adderall again for fatigue but I am certainly being careful. I'd love to hear anything! Just tell me what you know or think.

[Rant]	I can't even blame MS/cog fog because I've always been this absent minded. I'm sitting here eating dinner. About ten minutes ago, as I glanced at the bottle sitting on the counter, I thought about it - “Oh, I should just take that now.” I don't remember if I did or didn't. Taking a single pill is easy, simple, hands-off, mundane. No idea if I did it. Novartis sent me this nice calendar to mark off taking the pill. I know if I tried to use it I'd forget about it eventually. I suppose I have to go get a daily pill container now... Yeesh. **EDIT** I decided that I didn't. If I try to visualize taking the pill this evening I can't do it so I'm fairly certain I didn't. 	1	1	Can|’|t|remember|if|I|took|my|Gilenya|today|.|[|Rant|]	I|can't|even|blame|MS|/|cog|fog|because|I've|always|been|this|absent|minded|.|I'm|sitting|here|eating|dinner|.|About|ten|minutes|ago|,|as|I|glanced|at|the|bottle|sitting|on|the|counter|,|I|thought|about|it|-|“|Oh|,|I|should|just|take|that|now|.|”|I|don't|remember|if|I|did|or|didn't|.|Taking|a|single|pill|is|easy|,|simple|,|hands-off|,|mundane|.|No|idea|if|I|did|it|.|Novartis|sent|me|this|nice|calendar|to|mark|off|taking|the|pill|.|I|know|if|I|tried|to|use|it|I'd|forget|about|it|eventually|.|I|suppose|I|have|to|go|get|a|daily|pill|container|now|...|Yeesh|.|*|*|EDIT|*|*|I|decided|that|I|didn't|.|If|I|try|to|visualize|taking|the|pill|this|evening|I|can't|do|it|so|I'm|fairly|certain|I|didn't|.

In limbo for a year and a half	Hi all, I'll start by saying I am by no means looking for a diagnosis. However, what I am looking for is advice on navigating through the process of getting a diagnosis (or hopefully no diagnosis). I'm a 27 year old male living in the US. No existing health conditions, in good shape, and otherwise healthy. In October 2017, one night I was eating dinner and noticed I was having trouble initiating the swallow with solid foods. It was almost as if the food would pause and I would not remember how to begin swallowing. Obviously, this was scary because I constantly felt like I was going to choke. Saw a GP, they said it's probably just a bad sinus infection. When it kept happening intermittently, I decided to see another GP who ordered a barium swallow. Everything came back clear, minus some acid reflux. A few months later, with this symptom continuing to occur on and off, I decided to see another GP who ordered a brain MRI and a modified barium swallow (since my swallowing issue was with solids and not liquids). The MBS found no abnormalities. While the MRI was clear for the most part, the report stated the following: “There are approximately 12 small foci of T2 hyperintensity in the peripheral white matter of the paramedian anterior frontal lobes. The appearance is nonspecific in a patient of this age. The finding most likely represents sequelae of chronic migrane headaches. Less likely, this may represent chronic microvascular ischemic changes. There is no specific evidence of demyelinating disease, however, the possibility of demyelinating disease should also be considered due to the patient's age.” The neurologist was confident and said no follow up was needed. Over the past year, I've been fine — no other symptoms, and the swallowing issue would only reappear once in a blue moon. However recently, I've noticed it happening again and I'm starting to panic. Even the doctors I saw previously seem to write me off since I'm fairly young. Being in limbo is taking a big toll on me. Any advice on what next steps I should take? Thanks all. 	1	0	Where|to|go|from|here|?|In|limbo|for|a|year|and|a|half	Hi|all|,|I'll|start|by|saying|I|am|by|no|means|looking|for|a|diagnosis|.|However|,|what|I|am|looking|for|is|advice|on|navigating|through|the|process|of|getting|a|diagnosis|(|or|hopefully|no|diagnosis|)|.|I'm|a|27|year|old|male|living|in|the|US|.|No|existing|health|conditions|,|in|good|shape|,|and|otherwise|healthy|.|In|October|2017|,|one|night|I|was|eating|dinner|and|noticed|I|was|having|trouble|initiating|the|swallow|with|solid|foods|.|It|was|almost|as|if|the|food|would|pause|and|I|would|not|remember|how|to|begin|swallowing|.|Obviously|,|this|was|scary|because|I|constantly|felt|like|I|was|going|to|choke|.|Saw|a|GP|,|they|said|it's|probably|just|a|bad|sinus|infection|.|When|it|kept|happening|intermittently|,|I|decided|to|see|another|GP|who|ordered|a|barium|swallow|.|Everything|came|back|clear|,|minus|some|acid|reflux|.|A|few|months|later|,|with|this|symptom|continuing|to|occur|on|and|off|,|I|decided|to|see|another|GP|who|ordered|a|brain|MRI|and|a|modified|barium|swallow|(|since|my|swallowing|issue|was|with|solids|and|not|liquids|)|.|The|MBS|found|no|abnormalities|.|While|the|MRI|was|clear|for|the|most|part|,|the|report|stated|the|following|:|“|There|are|approximately|12|small|foci|of|T2|hyperintensity|in|the|peripheral|white|matter|of|the|paramedian|anterior|frontal|lobes|.|The|appearance|is|nonspecific|in|a|patient|of|this|age|.|The|finding|most|likely|represents|sequelae|of|chronic|migrane|headaches|.|Less|likely|,|this|may|represent|chronic|microvascular|ischemic|changes|.|There|is|no|specific|evidence|of|demyelinating|disease|,|however|,|the|possibility|of|demyelinating|disease|should|also|be|considered|due|to|the|patient's|age|.|”|The|neurologist|was|confident|and|said|no|follow|up|was|needed|.|Over|the|past|year|,|I've|been|fine|—|no|other|symptoms|,|and|the|swallowing|issue|would|only|reappear|once|in|a|blue|moon|.|However|recently|,|I've|noticed|it|happening|again|and|I'm|starting|to|panic|.|Even|the|doctors|I|saw|previously|seem|to|write|me|off|since|I'm|fairly|young|.|Being|in|limbo|is|taking|a|big|toll|on|me|.|Any|advice|on|what|next|steps|I|should|take|?|Thanks|all|.

"I started dancing about 4 years ago and it is such a great community and I have made so many friends. Since I started, I've gone out dancing almost every week. It is one of my biggest sources of joy and stress relief. It totally kept me sane in grad school and through my periods of unemployment between jobs. I was diagnosed this past November right around Thanksgiving after a pretty decent flare up with foot drop, right side weakness, double vision, MS hug and a few other things. I am so incredibly thankful that the steroids were able to bring everything under control and I'm now 99% back to ""normal"" and started a DMT in January. I just took my first solo trip (plane flight) to go to a dance event since my dx, and I have to say it went very well. I got decent sleep, I listened to my body and left the Saturday dance early since I was feeling tired, I took some me time to relax the next morning, I packed extra any tec doses in case of flight delays, which was smart due to snow. I got to make some new friends and reconnect with old ones I hadn't seen in years. I may have had a bit of a break down in the airport restroom on the way home, just thinking about how much this dance and community mean to me and I basically made a pact with myself that I am not going to let MS beat me until I don't have a choice. It may be scary, it may be new. I could wake up tomorrow and not be able to walk again. But until that happens I am not going to stop doing what I love. I may have to be a bit more responsible about listening to my body and taking rests but I want to dance as long as my body will let me. Tldr- I will dance as long as I can, because it gives me joy.

Both these drugs are in/finished phase 2 trials, and both have ARR's of 0.07 and 0.08 respectively. If you look into Ocrevus, Tysabri, or Lemtrada you'll see their trials had significantly higher ARR's (annual relapse rate) in the neighborhood of 0.15-0.26.   I'm looking to see if i'm interpreting this correctly that these 2 medicated are potentially significantly more effective than the current highest efficacy drugs. I know ARR is just one variable but its a pretty darn important one and easy to compare. I'm also not sure how the length of the trial plays in. I think the big 3's trials were mostly 2 years, where both of the new drugs look to just be one year, and while ARR is average per year, I would think a 2 year ARR would on average be higher than a 1 year???   2 new drug phase 2 trials below [https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2019/03/04/actrims2019-evobrutinib-significantly-reduces-brain-lesions-in-relapsing-ms-phase-2-trial-shows/](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2019/03/04/actrims2019-evobrutinib-significantly-reduces-brain-lesions-in-relapsing-ms-phase-2-trial-shows/)   [https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/TG+Therapeutics+%28TGTX%29+Announces+Final+Phase+2+Multiple+Sclerosis+Data+Presentation+at+ACTRIMS/15202610.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/TG+Therapeutics+%28TGTX%29+Announces+Final+Phase+2+Multiple+Sclerosis+Data+Presentation+at+ACTRIMS/15202610.html). 	1	0	Couple|of|new|drugs|efficacy|question|for|anyone|who|is|good|at|interpreting|these|things	I|read|some|information|on|two|new|RRMS|drug|trials|,|one|for|an|oral|called|Evobrutinib|and|one|for|an|injectable|that|seems|very|similar|to|Ocrevus|called|ublituximab|(|credit|u|/|Orangeseans|for|posting|that|one|last|week|.|Both|these|drugs|are|in|/|finished|phase|2|trials|,|and|both|have|ARR's|of|0.07|and|0.08|respectively|.|If|you|look|into|Ocrevus|,|Tysabri|,|or|Lemtrada|you'll|see|their|trials|had|significantly|higher|ARR's|(|annual|relapse|rate|)|in|the|neighborhood|of|0.15-|0.26|.|I'm|looking|to|see|if|i'm|interpreting|this|correctly|that|these|2|medicated|are|potentially|significantly|more|effective|than|the|current|highest|efficacy|drugs|.|I|know|ARR|is|just|one|variable|but|its|a|pretty|darn|important|one|and|easy|to|compare|.|I'm|also|not|sure|how|the|length|of|the|trial|plays|in|.|I|think|the|big|3|'|s|trials|were|mostly|2|years|,|where|both|of|the|new|drugs|look|to|just|be|one|year|,|and|while|ARR|is|average|per|year|,|I|would|think|a|2|year|ARR|would|on|average|be|higher|than|a|1|year|?|?|?|2|new|drug|phase|2|trials|below|[|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2019/03/04/actrims2019-evobrutinib-significantly-reduces-brain-lesions-in-relapsing-ms-phase-2-trial-shows/|]|(|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2019/03/04/actrims2019-evobrutinib-significantly-reduces-brain-lesions-in-relapsing-ms-phase-2-trial-shows/|)|[|https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/TG+Therapeutics+%28TGTX%29+Announces+Final+Phase+2+Multiple+Sclerosis+Data+Presentation+at+ACTRIMS/15202610.html|]|(|https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/TG+Therapeutics+%28TGTX%29+Announces+Final+Phase+2+Multiple+Sclerosis+Data+Presentation+at+ACTRIMS/15202610.html|)|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4713960054350789438/How-do-I-even-approach-this?	How do I even approach this?	Let me start by saying, outside of well-woman visits, I haven't been to the Dr. in years. I have a lot of anxiety around how to seek treatment for the symptoms I have been having. Around 7 years ago I had a spell of what I wrote off as Post-partum hormonal changes that manifested physically. A rocking sense of vertigo, like I was on a boat, muscle fatigue, weakness... this was accompanied by severe anxiety. So again, chalked it up to hormone changes. Lasted for about 4 months and it relented. Fast forward to last summer.... that same rocking dizziness reared it's ugly head, except this time it was accompanied by pins and needles/numbness in my entire right side. I've since been seeing a chiropractor, and it has helped some, maybe... However, the pins and needles and numbness, weakness, has been flaring up again lately, accompanied with a tightness in my throat. No dizziness this time, thank goodness. It's all got me pretty torn up. I'm relatively young, 30, with two small children. More than anything it has me frightened. I guess I don't know how to ask a primary care physician with whom I'm establishing care about this. I don't want to seem like googling my symptoms take precedence over their medical degree or even suggest that I really have any idea what is going on. I'm aware it may not be MS at all. I just don't know how to ask the right questions or to get the process started to find out what it may be. How did you broach the topic? 	1	0	How|do|I|even|approach|this|?

Would you switch from Gilenya to Ocrevus or another high efficacy DMT if you had no evidence of disease activity during the latest 6 months of Gilenya use?	I was diagnosed a little over a year ago. Been on Gilenya for a year, its my first and only DMT. At my 6 month followup I had one small new lesion that both my Neuros said may have happened during the drugs ramp up in my system and since I felt good and had no side effects they both suggested I stay on it. Now I have my 12 month MRI next week and I've decided if there's any new activity I will definitely switch to a higher efficacy medication, probably Ocrevus. However what I'm on the fence about is if there is no activity what to do so I'm looking for some opinions. A part of me thinks it would be crazy to switch meds if I'm tolerating Gilenya well and showed 6 months of no activity following 6 months of only one small new lesion coupled with the fact that switching meds increases your risk of relapses. But the other part of me is reading all the research on hit it as hard and fast as you can right from the get go. 	1	1	Would|you|switch|from|Gilenya|to|Ocrevus|or|another|high|efficacy|DMT|if|you|had|no|evidence|of|disease|activity|during|the|latest|6|months|of|Gilenya|use|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4713783103664452942/GET-A-SECOND-OPINION-my-story	GET A SECOND OPINION (my story)	Hey all, just wanted to share my brief situation and extend some personal advice to newly diagnosed individuals. I was diagnosed with RRMS in June after vertigo and numbness in my feet and legs. I had no clue what I was getting into and called for an appointment with a random neurologist. Though she was friendly, I now understand that I should have given more thought to my care. I was initially prescribed to take vitamin-D and 3 injections of glatiramer acetate (generic copaxone.) My foot and leg numbness went away amazingly fast and I was hopeful for a long journey without many relapses. On February 1, the numbness in my feet has returned and I was discouraged. My family encouraged me to get a second opinion, so I did. I was fortunate enough to get an appointment at Mayo Clinic. The neurologist there listened to my symptoms, treatments, and reviewed my MRI's/spinal tap. I now have a second appointment with her and am cutting ties with my initial neurologist. I learned that I was not receiving care from an MS specialist and the new neurologist would have worked on new medication the moment my MRI in December showed new lesions and relapses. I was also finally listened to about my severe exhaustion and fatigue and am prescribed some medicine to try and help that. The way this neurologist spoke and the knowledge she had just in her mind was fantastic. I am getting another MRI at the end of the month and finding the “right medication for me” to help symptoms. I also learned the importance of keeping the neurologist up to speed with symptoms, even if you aren't sure they are MS related in case steroids or treatment is needed (symptoms for more than 1 or 2 days.) I am still VERY inexperienced and don't mean to tell everyone how things go, but for newly diagnosed patients I highly suggest getting more help and however sick you might be with the doctor visits, don't settle for your current treatment. Thanks for listening and thank you all for the info and stories you have helped me with.

Neurologist is not convinced meds worth it as things stand.	My wife had optic neuritis just before Xmas, which lasted 2 weeks and now is completely gone. Back and forth through tests, we finally got the diagnosis yesterday. Her first relapse, retrospectively looking at it, was double vision in 1 eye about 5 years ago. The consultant said the first 5 years is the most important in terms of assessing the MS outlook. Based on the above, and the physical tests they ran through yesterday, he said so far it seems that the disease seems to be presenting fairly mildly, and as it stands the cons of DMDs could even outweigh the pros given the relative mildness of her disease ATM, so it's necessarily the best course of action. Does this sound reasonable to you? I should add, she is 20 weeks pregnant, so there is no urgent desire to put her on meds until after baby #2 is born, and the doc said we will review then. I'm only really looking to hear about studies and scientific evidence in regards to this possible approach vs treating aggressively as early as possible. Edit: oh ffs I've buggered up the title.

BUT then i found out that i had taken ocrevus while i was regularly sleeping in a room with a ton of mold that we didn't know about. so i was wondering was it the interaction of mold with suppressed immune system that made me worse, instead of just the O? i have been trying to get answers. i read that mold, combined with a supressed immune system, is really not good. i spoke with a nurse about my situation and she told me to come in, that the doc she works for helps with mold lawsuits and could def. help me. so i switched insurances and waited a month and a half just to see the doc... went today... and he said he can't help me, he only deals with people with breathing problems :/ the EPA told me mold can hurt people who are immunocompromised and that it didn't have to result in breathing problems. does anyone know what kind of doctor deals with the intersection between autoimmunity AND mold?? an allergist/imunoogist does not know much about MS. my MS doc does not know about mold. i am just wondering if there is someone else i should go to. we just found more water damage in my apartment and now another remediator has to come to see if there is mold behind our ceilings. we are trying to figure out if we should move out, and i am trying to figure out if i should sue my landlord. 	1	1	what|kind|of|doctor|would|know|about|mold's|effect|on|someone|who|has|a|suppressed|immune|system|from|being|on|a|dmd|?|i|just|went|to|a|pulmonologist|bc|i|had|been|told|to|,|turns|out|its|wrong|kind|of|doc|(|i|can|breathe|fine|)|.	hi|all|,|as|i've|mentioned|here|in|the|past|i|got|noticably|worse|very|soon|after|doing|ocrevus|,|my|first|DMD|,|and|elected|not|to|continue|(|i|am|doing|a|lilttle|better|now|.|)|BUT|then|i|found|out|that|i|had|taken|ocrevus|while|i|was|regularly|sleeping|in|a|room|with|a|ton|of|mold|that|we|didn't|know|about|.|so|i|was|wondering|was|it|the|interaction|of|mold|with|suppressed|immune|system|that|made|me|worse|,|instead|of|just|the|O|?|i|have|been|trying|to|get|answers|.|i|read|that|mold|,|combined|with|a|supressed|immune|system|,|is|really|not|good|.|i|spoke|with|a|nurse|about|my|situation|and|she|told|me|to|come|in|,|that|the|doc|she|works|for|helps|with|mold|lawsuits|and|could|def|.|help|me|.|so|i|switched|insurances|and|waited|a|month|and|a|half|just|to|see|the|doc|...|went|today|...|and|he|said|he|can't|help|me|,|he|only|deals|with|people|with|breathing|problems|:/|the|EPA|told|me|mold|can|hurt|people|who|are|immunocompromised|and|that|it|didn't|have|to|result|in|breathing|problems|.|does|anyone|know|what|kind|of|doctor|deals|with|the|intersection|between|autoimmunity|AND|mold|?|?|an|allergist|/|imunoogist|does|not|know|much|about|MS|.|my|MS|doc|does|not|know|about|mold|.|i|am|just|wondering|if|there|is|someone|else|i|should|go|to|.|we|just|found|more|water|damage|in|my|apartment|and|now|another|remediator|has|to|come|to|see|if|there|is|mold|behind|our|ceilings|.|we|are|trying|to|figure|out|if|we|should|move|out|,|and|i|am|trying|to|figure|out|if|i|should|sue|my|landlord|.

Diff infection that won't go away... any ideas? What does it mean for treatment?	"I know infections can be a common occurrence in people with MS (to our misfortune) but this is getting ridiculous... A month ago I became ill with an infection brought on by food for the first time; antibiotics cleared it up. Fast forward a few weeks and my symptoms never totally resolved (I have IBS too so I kinda just tried to ignore it). Went back to my Gastro after eating gave me constant nausea and vomiting among other things. Few tests later...**Clostridium difficile** dxd and I'm even sicker then I started with thanks to antibiotics. At least now a cocktail of meds keeps the symptoms in check mostly. That said, the Vancomycin seems to be doing nothing so I need some help. Has anyone else with MS dealt with this infection? How did you clear it up and how long did it take? More important, what did you do to prevent it from returning and how long can you get it again? I know it has a high recurrence rate but do those risks eventually lower themselves or are you just always at an increased risk after having been exposed? How do you even get this in the first place if not antibiotics - my Neuro's first comment was ""how the heck did you get that?"" Lastly, I've read flare ups usually happen after bad infections. How true is this and what can I do to prevent that (assuming I'm not in some sort of relapse already)? How long should I wait to begin treatment again? I wasn't on Tysabri for over a month prior to when I would've been infected and I'm not now but I'm terrified to return to it since I pick up crap like this when NOT on the med what will it be like ON the med full term? This crap is getting really old... pun intended. Any thoughts or experiences would be appreciated!

The findings were presented at the annual Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2019, in Dallas, Texas, on Feb. 28. The presentation, given by Kristen Krysko, MD, from UCSF, was titled “Leukocyte Telomere Length Is Associated with Disability Progression in Multiple Sclerosis Independent of Chronological Age.” The study suggested that preserving telomere length can be a therapeutic or preventative strategy for MS. Factors contributing to MS disease progression are not fully understood. Although older chronological age is a factor known to be associated with a faster time for a patient to reach certain disability milestones. This suggests that aging-related mechanisms in cells, and damage to those that protect cells from aging, may contribute to the neurodegeneration underlying MS progression. A process associated with aging is the shortening of the telomeres that protect the ends of chromosomes — long strings of DNA that contain genetic information. Telomeres shorten every time cells grow and divide, a naturally occurring biological aging process. However, telomere shortening can be sped up by DNA-damaging factors, such as UV-rays. Also, several diseases have been linked to excessive telomere shortening, such as heart disease, dementia, autoimmune diseases, and also primary progressive MS. Interestingly, the telomere length in leukocytes — immune cells involved in counteracting foreign substances and disease— has been linked with MS disease progression. However, how chronological aging, biological aging (as measured by leukocyte telomere length), and MS progression are associated is not known. Researchers at UCSF dove into this question. They examined the possible links between leukocyte telomere length, chronological age, and disease duration with brain volume and clinical disability in MS patients. To do so, researchers took advantage of UCSF's EPIC cohort study — an intensive observational study of more than 500 MS patients who have been carefully followed since 2004 to gain a greater understanding of MS susceptibility and long-term progression. In total, data from 356 women and 160 men were analyzed. Their average age at the start of the study was 43 years, a median disease duration of six years, and a median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.5 (range 0-7; the higher the EDSS score, the worse the patient's disability). To measure leukocyte telomere length, researchers analyzed patients' DNA samples. Telomeres are made of repeated bits of DNA, and comparing these repeats to other bits of known unrepeated DNA gives an approximation of telomere length. At the start of the study, researchers found that shorter leukocyte telomere lengths were strongly associated with a greater chronological age and longer disease duration. In addition, they saw that total brain volume decreased with a shortening of telomere length, independently of chronological age — meaning that patients whose telomeres were shorter, had more advanced disease regardless of how old they were. When patients were followed over time, results showed that those with shorter leukocyte telomere lengths at the start of the trial had increased EDSS scores and lower brain volumes, over time, indicating accelerated disease progression. The team also analyzed a subset of 23 patients who developed secondary progressive MS (SPMS) during the follow-up period. These patients were matched on age, sex, and disease duration to participants who remained with relapsing MS. Results showed that, in these 23 matched pairs, a change in leukocyte telomere length was predictive of a change in disability (EDSS score) over 10 years — as leukocyte telomere length decreased, EDSS increased. “Shorter telomere length was associated with disability in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses after adjustment for chronological age, suggesting biological aging may contribute to neurological injury in MS,” the researchers wrote. Thus, “targeting aging-related processes may be a potential therapeutic strategy,” Krysko suggested. 	1	0	Leukocyte|Telomere|Length|Shortening|is|Predictive|of|Disability|Progression|in|MS|,|Study|Shows	https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2019/03/01/day-28-actrims2019-shorter-leukocyte-telomere-predicts-ms-progression/|MARCH|1|,|2019|BY|JONATHAN|GRINSTEIN|IN|NEWS|.|#ACTRIMS2019|–|Leukocyte|Telomere|Length|Shortening|is|Predictive|of|Disability|Progression|in|MS|,|Study|Shows|As|the|protective|molecular|caps|of|our|genetic|information|—|called|telomeres|—|become|shorter|in|certain|immune|cells|,|the|extent|of|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|disability|progression|increases|,|regardless|of|age|,|researchers|at|the|University|of|California|,|San|Francisco|(|UCSF|)|reported|.|The|findings|were|presented|at|the|annual|Americas|Committee|for|Treatment|and|Research|in|Multiple|Sclerosis|(|ACTRIMS|)|Forum|2019|,|in|Dallas|,|Texas|,|on|Feb|.|28|.|The|presentation|,|given|by|Kristen|Krysko|,|MD|,|from|UCSF|,|was|titled|“|Leukocyte|Telomere|Length|Is|Associated|with|Disability|Progression|in|Multiple|Sclerosis|Independent|of|Chronological|Age|.|”|The|study|suggested|that|preserving|telomere|length|can|be|a|therapeutic|or|preventative|strategy|for|MS|.|Factors|contributing|to|MS|disease|progression|are|not|fully|understood|.|Although|older|chronological|age|is|a|factor|known|to|be|associated|with|a|faster|time|for|a|patient|to|reach|certain|disability|milestones|.|This|suggests|that|aging-related|mechanisms|in|cells|,|and|damage|to|those|that|protect|cells|from|aging|,|may|contribute|to|the|neurodegeneration|underlying|MS|progression|.|A|process|associated|with|aging|is|the|shortening|of|the|telomeres|that|protect|the|ends|of|chromosomes|—|long|strings|of|DNA|that|contain|genetic|information|.|Telomeres|shorten|every|time|cells|grow|and|divide|,|a|naturally|occurring|biological|aging|process|.|However|,|telomere|shortening|can|be|sped|up|by|DNA-damaging|factors|,|such|as|UV-rays|.|Also|,|several|diseases|have|been|linked|to|excessive|telomere|shortening|,|such|as|heart|disease|,|dementia|,|autoimmune|diseases|,|and|also|primary|progressive|MS|.|Interestingly|,|the|telomere|length|in|leukocytes|—|immune|cells|involved|in|counteracting|foreign|substances|and|disease|—|has|been|linked|with|MS|disease|progression|.|However|,|how|chronological|aging|,|biological|aging|(|as|measured|by|leukocyte|telomere|length|)|,|and|MS|progression|are|associated|is|not|known|.|Researchers|at|UCSF|dove|into|this|question|.|They|examined|the|possible|links|between|leukocyte|telomere|length|,|chronological|age|,|and|disease|duration|with|brain|volume|and|clinical|disability|in|MS|patients|.|To|do|so|,|researchers|took|advantage|of|UCSF's|EPIC|cohort|study|—|an|intensive|observational|study|of|more|than|500|MS|patients|who|have|been|carefully|followed|since|2004|to|gain|a|greater|understanding|of|MS|susceptibility|and|long-term|progression|.|In|total|,|data|from|356|women|and|160|men|were|analyzed|.|Their|average|age|at|the|start|of|the|study|was|43|years|,|a|median|disease|duration|of|six|years|,|and|a|median|Expanded|Disability|Status|Scale|(|EDSS|)|of|1.5|(|range|0-7|;|the|higher|the|EDSS|score|,|the|worse|the|patient's|disability|)|.|To|measure|leukocyte|telomere|length|,|researchers|analyzed|patients|'|DNA|samples|.|Telomeres|are|made|of|repeated|bits|of|DNA|,|and|comparing|these|repeats|to|other|bits|of|known|unrepeated|DNA|gives|an|approximation|of|telomere|length|.|At|the|start|of|the|study|,|researchers|found|that|shorter|leukocyte|telomere|lengths|were|strongly|associated|with|a|greater|chronological|age|and|longer|disease|duration|.|In|addition|,|they|saw|that|total|brain|volume|decreased|with|a|shortening|of|telomere|length|,|independently|of|chronological|age|—|meaning|that|patients|whose|telomeres|were|shorter|,|had|more|advanced|disease|regardless|of|how|old|they|were|.|When|patients|were|followed|over|time|,|results|showed|that|those|with|shorter|leukocyte|telomere|lengths|at|the|start|of|the|trial|had|increased|EDSS|scores|and|lower|brain|volumes|,|over|time|,|indicating|accelerated|disease|progression|.|The|team|also|analyzed|a|subset|of|23|patients|who|developed|secondary|progressive|MS|(|SPMS|)|during|the|follow-up|period|.|These|patients|were|matched|on|age|,|sex|,|and|disease|duration|to|participants|who|remained|with|relapsing|MS|.|Results|showed|that|,|in|these|23|matched|pairs|,|a|change|in|leukocyte|telomere|length|was|predictive|of|a|change|in|disability|(|EDSS|score|)|over|10|years|—|as|leukocyte|telomere|length|decreased|,|EDSS|increased|.|“|Shorter|telomere|length|was|associated|with|disability|in|both|cross-sectional|and|longitudinal|analyses|after|adjustment|for|chronological|age|,|suggesting|biological|aging|may|contribute|to|neurological|injury|in|MS|,|”|the|researchers|wrote|.|Thus|,|“|targeting|aging-related|processes|may|be|a|potential|therapeutic|strategy|,|”|Krysko|suggested|.

Original Press Release from the Advanced Science Research Center at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York Metabolite Drug Tackles Multiple Sclerosis by Altering T Cells' Epigenetic Landscape Understanding and mitigating the role of epigenetics (environmental influences that trigger changes in gene expression) in disease development is a major goal of researchers. Now, a newly published paper featured on the March cover of the journal Brain adds significantly to this work by detailing how metabolites can be used to inhibit epigenetic mechanisms and effectively treat a range of diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera™)—a cell-permeable metabolite in the family of fumaric acid esters (FAEs)—is an approved treatment for MS and is potentially an effective therapy for other autoimmune diseases. The precise mechanism of the drug's action has been only partially understood, however. In their new paper, researchers at the Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC) at The Graduate Center of The City University of New York and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai take a major step toward unraveling the mystery by identifying a possible mechanism of action for FAEs. In doing so, they also highlight new concepts that may lay the groundwork for the development of novel classes of drugs for the treatment of MS and other diseases. Scientists believe that MS develops when epigenetic changes cause certain brain-homing immune cells—or T cells—to attack the central nervous system. In their current paper, researchers posited that FAE metabolites work by mitigating the development of certain brain-homing T cells. “This work has given us extremely useful insight into how we might leverage the metabolic-epigenetic interplay between cells and their environment to create new immune-modulating therapies for diseases like MS,” said Patrizia Casaccia, director of the ASRC Neuroscience Initiative and a professor of genetics and neuroscience at Mount Sinai. “It may one day be possible to target and suppress production of the specific brain-homing T cells that play a role in the development of MS.” Researchers recruited 97 volunteers with MS that were either treatment-naïve (47), FAE-treated (35), or glatiramer acetate-treated (16). Blood samples were collected from each participant and their levels of brain-homing T cells were measured by looking at the percentages of the chemokine receptors CCR4 and CCR6, which are critical to T cell trafficking between the gut, brain, and skin. The data showed significantly lower levels of these brain-homing T cells in the FAE-treated group than in the other comparison groups. Researchers subsequently analyzed how FAEs change the epigenetic landscape of T cells to reduce the development of these pathogenic cells. Specifically, they found that FAEs have a strong epigenetic effect on a particular DNA region in T cells that includes a micro RNA called MIR-21, which is necessary to create disease-associated brain-homing T cells. Taken together, the results suggest that the immunomodulatory effect of FAEs in MS is at least in part due to the epigenetic regulation of these specific brain-homing T cells. “Our findings about therapeutically active metabolites have implications for the treatment of not only multiple sclerosis but also other autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, which involve the same type of T cells,” said Achilles Ntranos, lead author of the paper and a physician and neuroimmunology fellow at Mount Sinai Hospital whose work is supported by the Leon Levy Foundation and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes. “Understanding the epigenetic effect of metabolites on the immune system will help us develop several novel strategies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, which could help patients and physicians achieve better clinical outcomes.” This article has been republished from materials provided by the Advanced Science Research Center at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

RRMS Conversion to SPMS Is Preceded by Spinal Cord Atrophy The rate of spinal cord tissue loss is a strong indicator of conversion from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to secondary progressive MS (SPMS), according to a finding presented at the fourth annual Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2019. The forum is taking place in Dallas, Texas, (Feb. 28–March 2), and the results were presented by Antje Bischof, MD, from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). The presentation was titled “Accelerated Cord Atrophy Precedes Conversion to Secondary Progressive Disease in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis.” . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been a useful tool to assess potential markers of disease progression and disability. MRI studies in MS patients show that a decreased spinal cord area is strongly associated with increased disability, and suggest that the spinal cord area can distinguish relapsing from progressive forms of MS. However, the use of spinal cord atrophy (shrinkage) as a biomarker for MS disease disability and type needs to be studied further. To address this gap, researchers at UCSF conducted a longitudinal study — meaning a study involving repeated examination of the same measures, in the same people, over a certain period of time. The study, started in 2004, evaluated spinal cord atrophy in MS patients through MRI scans over the course of 12 years. In total, 54 RRMS patients who converted to SPMS during the 12-year observation period were analyzed. These patients were matched, based on demographic and clinical criteria, to 54 other RRMS patients who did not convert to SPMS during the same time period. In addition, 54 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (the control group) were evaluated. Based on brain MRIs, which included the upper spinal cord part called the C1 level, researchers analyzed brain volume and spinal cord area at C1 level to determine whether changes in these parameters could distinguish between RRMS patients who did and those who did not convert to SPMS during the observation period. Results showed that patients who converted to SPMS had accelerated rates of spinal cord atrophy before conversion to a progressive disease course (atrophy average of 2.15% per year), compared to their RRMS matches who did not convert to SPMS (atrophy average of 0.74% per year). Importantly, Bischof noted that this difference in rate of spinal cord atrophy could be detected up to four years before conversion to SPMS. In contrast, measures of brain atrophy or white matter lesions — including lesion volume, and regional and global brain volumes at baseline and over time — did not discriminate between the two groups. Furthermore, according to Bischof, relapse rate, disease duration, the presence of new or enlarging lesions, and the use of disease-modifying therapies also did not discriminate RRMS patients who converted to SPMS from those who did not convert. Based on the results, Bischof concluded that “cervical cord atrophy (C1 level), as obtained from routine brain MRI, is a strong indicator of impending conversion to SPMS.” The researchers suggested that “cervical atrophy rate at C1 level could be used as a prognostic marker to study the role of genetic, environmental, and immune variables on MS, and to measure the long-term impact of treatment in clinical trials.” In addition, Bischof suggested that C1 atrophy also could be used in “early stratification [classification] of patients at risk for severe disability to guide individualized treatment decisions.” Overall, according to the team, the annual rate of cervical cord tissue loss is “the strongest indicator among currently available imaging markers” of conversion from RRMS to SPMS.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4713429199322377619/No-Oligoclonal-Bands-in-CSF?	No Oligoclonal Bands in CSF?	Hey! I am new to this forum as I was diagnosed with MS (RRMS) on 2/1/19 after having loss of sensation in saddle region and eventually optic neuritis. Both have pretty much cleared up after steroids and I am just left with tingling in my feet. I had my lumbar puncture on 2/8 and my results for Oligoclonal Bands came back negative. I was wondering if anyone else in forum could relate? I read that 85% of patients with MS have these bands present in their CSF. I also read that being negative for these bands could lead to a more mild form of MS (debatable research, I know. Grasping at straws here). I was just wondering what other people diagnosed with MS who were also negative for Oligoclonal Bands, MS journey has looked like? For more information, other results in my LP were “concerning” for MS as well as me having 6 lesions in my brain (mostly asymptomatic). I am almost 25 years old and this diagnosis came out of left field. No one I am related to has MS nor does anyone even have an autoimmune disease. I am very afraid of what my future will look like. I just got a new MS Neurologist who ordered a few more test in order for him to decide which my treatment plan. So I am sure I'll post here in a couple weeks to get more advice.

I am yet to get my LP done but the Mri and vision evoked potential tests have confirmed MS. My husband is a firm believer of Ayurveda, so am I, a tad bit lesser. I have read stories of how people have reversed their MS through yoga, meditation naturopathy and ayurvedic medicine. I have started consulting the Ayurvedic doctor and am following his medication. I am still in my relapse stage, symptom being a lot of dizziness and imbalance. Hence haven't been able to start on yoga or meditation yet. Needed you guys to help me figure if this is the right decision. Or should I just follow the traditional Western medicine? I am just weary of the side effects and how far it is going to be effective. Besides, it is very overwhelming too. Apparently, my MS is at an early stage Thanks Priyanka. 	1	1	Is|Ayurveda|/|Yoga|a|definitive|way|?

When I saw that even Selma Blair's doctors didn't believe - or weren't able - to diagnose her illness, I was shocked. You mean this Happens to rich and famous people too? I spent two months telling doctors that there was something wrong with me. Numbness tingling etc. I was told anxiety. I kept pushing for a neurologist. Pushed for mri tests which were considered non emergency so took months. Pushed to get that moved up. Basically I was diagnosed with NMO - something like Ms but acute and causes irreversible damage. It's rare. So rare no one knew what the hell it was. My ophthalmologist told me its prob MS but those people get their sight back. Long short is I lost vision in both eyes rapidly over the period I was begging for help. if they cared to catch it earlier I may have not had to go through the recovery i did.

He was diagnosed with MS officially early January after about 4 months of delayed testing (his specialist is an asshole as far as I'm concerned) and he's been taking various meds to deal with pain and such. He's been resistant to treatment after his doctor suggested a trial on Gilenya. He doesn't like the potential side effects and decided he wasn't going to do it especially since he's dealing with the pain better now. We just got into a fight because he finally told me our insurance wouldn't cover the cost even though he found out a while ago.

"So I've had a rather stressful week or so at work and I've noticed a few times the odd instance where I read a word in text and it just has no meaning to me. The first time this happened was the other day with the word ""Facebook"". And we use a lot of acronyms at work, today is about the third time this week when I've stared at word and had the thought ""what does that mean? I've never seen this before? it doesn't make any sense?"" but I know it means something and I know I've seen it before and after a few seconds of thinking and then saying the phrase out loud I finally remember what it actually means. Just curious if anyone else has encountered something like this? I know sometimes I struggle to put what I'm thinking into words when I speak, but this is the first time I've noticed something kind of the opposite. I'm still fairly newly diagnosed (last Thanksgiving) so if I didn't know I had MS I probably wouldn't think twice about it but since this is something I've never really encountered before it does make me a little bit worried.

I am new to this sub, on mobile, and first-time poster to this sub. I (28 years old) have a meeting with my Neurologist to discuss a potential diagnosis and treatment options. Last time I talked with him (Dec. 2018), he said he will most likely give the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, based on medical evidence. He just wanted to compare current MRIs with the old ones from symptom onset before making sure. For a little bit of background- I have been experiencing symptoms of numbness, tingling, constant/daily headache and/or migraine, and fatigue for 7 years. There are days that I can't walk without support from a cane, write with a pen/pencil, or sit for long periods of time. The symptoms were more constant 5 years ago, but I still experience 1-3 days per month that I have to call in to work and stay home (which is uber frustrating). I was 'somewhat' diagnosed in 2014, but a different neurologist and her doctoral student/resident (in a different state from my current residence) at the time did not want to give me any diagnosis due to having questionable/low results from 3 MRIs and a lumbar puncture. The only reason I received a diagnosis at the time was because I specifically asked for one as I needed it to receive disability resource services at university, and had been waiting for 1.5 years. I am an analytical person, who went to school to become a behavior scientist. So, I appreciate evidence-based treatment and diagnoses. I wasn't going to subject myself to needless medication and side effects if specialists did not know evidence of a sure diagnosis. Plus, the peer reviewed articles I read about some of the treatments seemed to show dismal results. I mean 35% success rate with the treatment group compared to the control (Ticfedera)? Come on. Not worth it if I didn't know if I actually had demielinization, and evidence didn't show it. The other injections didn't show much better results either I would like to ask for insight from the Reddit MS community. During this upcoming meeting, what should I ask my neurologist about prognosis? What should I be asking about the medications? What about specifics about possible funding for these treatments? Is it a good idea to see about finding a way to request medically necessary nutritionist consultation from my insurance? What are some things you wished you had asked your neurologist? How do I find recent peer reviewed articles for MS treatment? (I am no longer a student and don't have free access to academic journal databases and online libraries) Thank you all in advance!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4713193264337473136/Irrational-Fears-and-MS	Irrational Fears and MS	I was diagnosed with cis at the end of November (optic neuritus) 1 lesion on optic nerve and questionable spot in the back of my brain. Tested positive for the oliglonal bands (a lot unfortunately). I had a clean spinal mri last month but my neuro is getting another next week as I have had buzzing and tingling but all very intermittent and never persists. They wonder if it could be anxiety related, but idk how because I've had anxiety issues all of my life and never had tingling or buzzing from it. Anyway I'm a 27 year old male with a wife and 2 children under 3 and 1 on the way in July. I have been helplessly depressed and anxious which I guess is pretty common, but I've had this great fear of dying soon. All doctors say I'm not, but I can't shake this feeling of impending doom. Does anyone have any pointers about staying positive? I have this huge fear of dying and leaving my wife and kids behind. I've almost developed compulsive issues with checking my eyes because I can't stand vision being different, I've developed floaters which are annoying and add to the stress. I'm very day to day on depression. I will go a couple days being “happy” and then a couple full of self doubt. I started therapy to try and help which is very unlike me, but I think my wife was worried so I decided to talk to a professional. All of this while starting a new job! I was in the hospital getting iv steroids my first week of work after I got off. Anyway, I wanted to introduce myself and maybe get some feedback on my anxiety issues, I have been lurking a while and I really liked this community as not everyone was super negative. I don't need more negativity. I just want to be happy again and look forward to tomorrow.

I'd been having issues with weakness in my right leg, toe dragging, and foot drop. Went to PT for all that and they recommended an MRI of my head and lumbar spine. They did the head one first, found the lesions, and cancelled the lumbar MRI. Just wrote the leg issues off as MS. I changed doctors after my diagnosis. My new doctor sided with me that I needed to have the lumbar MRI just to make sure that my leg issues weren't anything other than MS. Just got the results back and I've got 2 bulging discs and a cyst that they believe is putting pressure on the nerves for my right leg. Still waiting to see a spine specialist (my appointment is in a few weeks), but it sounds like my right leg, which is what I have most of my issues with, might not even be related to my MS! 	1	0	Had|a|lumbar|MRI|and|just|got|the|results|.

I truly thinks she wants an endorsement deal for Ocrevus or something. I just saw how she said her neurologist told her “people can't usually speak during flare ups”.

I feel like people just don't care. I was diagnosed 2 years ago, and no one in my family or close friends seem to care. Strangers give me more attention and ask more questions. No one asks me about it, no one checks in to make sure I'm ok. It feels like they think I just stub my toe and I'll be fine. Like I'm married and have a couple kids and my wife doesn't even ask me how I'm doing with it. To explain, most of my symptoms are internal, like numbness and pain. I do my best to try and live he best life I can, but sometimes I can't get out of bed from the fatigue, they think I'm being lazy. I slept for 17 hours the other day, that's not lazy, that means something is wrong and I'm dealing with something. I apologies if this is poorly written, I'm more of a lurker than a typer.

It's like my internal temperature gauge bottoms out at 39 degrees. I can tell it's cold and I need a jacket, but not how cold. My coworkers keep complaining about how freezing it is outside and I have to check the temperature. This has been an especial boon when the temperature dropped down to -20F for several days a few weeks ago. Thankfully I have my husband around to complain about how cold it is outside, so I know how much to bundle up and to limit my time outdoors. 	1	1	One|small|benefit|of|MS	In|the|past|few|months|,|I've|lost|the|ability|to|tell|when|it's|cold|outside|.|It's|like|my|internal|temperature|gauge|bottoms|out|at|39|degrees|.|I|can|tell|it's|cold|and|I|need|a|jacket|,|but|not|how|cold|.|My|coworkers|keep|complaining|about|how|freezing|it|is|outside|and|I|have|to|check|the|temperature|.|This|has|been|an|especial|boon|when|the|temperature|dropped|down|to|-|20F|for|several|days|a|few|weeks|ago|.|Thankfully|I|have|my|husband|around|to|complain|about|how|cold|it|is|outside|,|so|I|know|how|much|to|bundle|up|and|to|limit|my|time|outdoors|.

Well, make sure that you don't find out soon, that way what may be already permanent damage from lyme, will be even worse! Grand fucking ideas. Of course, I can't blame my mother. The neuro my doctor referred decided it was better for a pediatric neuro (if they are even an actual neuro) to see me. Because I'm under 18. Wow, now not only is my appointment way to long out, I'm not even going to someone qualified do deal with MS-Like symptoms at all! But, they can tell me if its developmental. And when the tests are finished in April, ill be able to talk to an actual neuro. Who will order more tests that will take another chunk of time to finish. Never been happier! I'm going to be so pissed off if its lyme, and these doctors delayed treatment by over a month. 	1	0	Apparently|my|neuro|app|is|further|out|than|I|thought|.

I have some questions below if you could answer them it would really help me out: 1. Do you have issues with emotional or angry outbursts? 2. Do your loved ones suffer sometimes due to your angry reactions or emotional lability? What can they do in these situations to help? 3. Would your significant other say you were always respectful and can deal with conflict easily? Or are your reactions unpredictable at times? 4. Do you ever find yourself giving extreme reactions to situations that wouldn't normally warrant a reaction like this? Then later regretting it and getting upset? Or would you say you have had stable moods throughout your MS? 5. Does your specialist ever ask you about mood/behaviours or focus on that aspect of your MS? 6.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4711659684054199137/Going-through-a-tough-part-of-my-journey-and-I'm-actually-excited!	Going through a tough part of my journey and I'm actually excited!	"Pre Ms I was working 70 hours a week and going to school full time, busting my butt and had all these ideas of how I was going to help shape and mold my kids into adults, be a ""great"" mom. Plan was to buy a house, get them a yard and a dog, give them everything I had. Tball, hiking, rafting, reading, all the things that are difficult now. The onset of my MS was bad and right before it started I signed papers on a house. Single mom, worked my butt off to buy a house. We move in and it goes okay in the beginning, then I start to struggle to keep up a house and take care of myself and kids, and for the past 2 years I'm barely keeping my head above water. After a lot of agonizing, I decided to sell my house and move closer to family so my son can attend a better school and I can get help. I should have made this decision 3 years ago, but I had this plan in my head of what I was going to do in life, and that plan included my house. Ive been sad about having to give up the house, and move where I will get more help, because I'm stubborn. I hate people helping me, I feel like I owe them my life now. But that ""plan"" was not my ultimate goal, my ultimate goal was to be a good mom. I'm selling my 3 bedroom house to move in to a travel trailer with a 5 and 6 year old and a dog and cat. Im giving up something I worked hard for, surrendering to getting help from people. And I'm actually excited! Downsizing, easier to clean, less stuff to manage. I want our family to be more outdoorsy, and for my kids to be outside more. I always dreamed of taking them hiking and camping, fun things that I was waiting until they hit this age for so I could be safe alone with two kids in the woods, and then I got sick and that's not an option at this moment. But smaller house means they have no choice. Travel trailer will cut the energy it takes to go on vacation in half, I might be able to take them by myself one time! (I will have no problem once they are a little older, just right now it's harder) and it's big enough to sleep my sister's family as well, so we will be taking vacations! Im on disability now, cant really afford to rent a house, hate apartments and feel it would be hard on my ms, so this is very appealing financially. Now I can afford for other things that will help me run a house. small house means more family time. Having my sister living next door means I can take my kid to tball and not worry about not being able to walk and take care of him that afternoon. It means someone can help me clean my house if I cannot muster it and my kids can have more company over. They have two more adults to take them on social outings and help with homework. This is nothing like my pre MS plan, but the outcome, everything I wanted to instill in my kids, it's going to happen, just a different path. I was really upset and felt like I was forfeiting my last stitch of independence. Crappy of me not to be less selfish sooner, but nope, I'm being a good mom, or going to be lol my MS has often made me worried I wouldn't be able to. Heck yes! Those pre ms goals are achievable, the path to get there is different, and maybe even the image you have of what that goal means, may change, let it. Roll with the punches.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4711305778469430600/Convinced-I-have-MS	Convinced I have MS	As the title suggest, I firmly believe I have MS. I wake up a lot in the middle of the night with my hand with pins and needles. I notice when I cut my toenails and stand on one foot, the foot standing will start to get pins and needles. Around a year ago, I was getting these sort of head rushes/brain fogin my brainthe moment I was about to go to sleep causing me to be unable to sleep. I got it sometimes when I was waking up in the morning as well. This only happened like every month or so, so it wasn't that concerning. However last night something happened that is really concerning to me. I was going to sleep calmly, as In I didn't really have anything on my mind that would like pump up my anxiety. All I can remember is I was either alseep when this happened or about to fall asleep. All of the sudden I start getting the head rush again, but it's different this time. Tbh I felt like I was about to die because I had no idea what was going on with me. It's hard to explain but basically I got the head rush and it was more intense than the others. I'm pretty sure that my head was shaking/bobbing involuntarily. The scary thing was that it took me awhile to like open my eyes. I was stuck in it for awhile, maybe 5-7 seconds which lasted a long time for me. But yeah it probably sounds dumb, but I couldn't tell if I was about to die or something so it made me panic a lot. I am kindve convinced that this may have been a seizure, but I don't think I've ever had one so I'm not sure what a seizure is truly like based off the Internet. Anyways that happened at around 1AM and I couldn't fall asleep again because I was very scared and considered waking up my parents ( I'm 17) but figured I'll wait for tomorrow. I started to get these head rushes again while trying to fall asleep, so I didn't fall asleep until probably around 3:30 and woke up at 7 and didn't feel tired at all, probably just cuz it's the only thing non my mind. MS is something I thought I had a while back because of the pins and needles, head rushes, fatigue I would get. I tried to brush it off and convince myself it was just anxiety getting the best of me. But now I just had that supposed “seizure” which is supposed to be common in people with ms. Another thing I've noticed recently is that I've been tending to have short term memory loss I guess, like I would think of a video to search up on YouTube, then 5 seconds later forget what the video I was thinking of was called. I would just like to get your guys input because my parents will just say I'm reading to much stuff on the internet if I approach them about it, but they don't know what I've been feeling. Anyways thanks in advance, I probably wrote this poorly since I'm on my iPhone, but I hope it gets the point across. 	1	0	Convinced|I|have|MS	As|the|title|suggest|,|I|firmly|believe|I|have|MS|.|I|wake|up|a|lot|in|the|middle|of|the|night|with|my|hand|with|pins|and|needles|.|I|notice|when|I|cut|my|toenails|and|stand|on|one|foot|,|the|foot|standing|will|start|to|get|pins|and|needles|.|Around|a|year|ago|,|I|was|getting|these|sort|of|head|rushes|/|brain|fogin|my|brainthe|moment|I|was|about|to|go|to|sleep|causing|me|to|be|unable|to|sleep|.|I|got|it|sometimes|when|I|was|waking|up|in|the|morning|as|well|.|This|only|happened|like|every|month|or|so|,|so|it|wasn't|that|concerning|.|However|last|night|something|happened|that|is|really|concerning|to|me|.|I|was|going|to|sleep|calmly|,|as|In|I|didn't|really|have|anything|on|my|mind|that|would|like|pump|up|my|anxiety|.|All|I|can|remember|is|I|was|either|alseep|when|this|happened|or|about|to|fall|asleep|.|All|of|the|sudden|I|start|getting|the|head|rush|again|,|but|it's|different|this|time|.|Tbh|I|felt|like|I|was|about|to|die|because|I|had|no|idea|what|was|going|on|with|me|.|It's|hard|to|explain|but|basically|I|got|the|head|rush|and|it|was|more|intense|than|the|others|.|I'm|pretty|sure|that|my|head|was|shaking|/|bobbing|involuntarily|.|The|scary|thing|was|that|it|took|me|awhile|to|like|open|my|eyes|.|I|was|stuck|in|it|for|awhile|,|maybe|5-7|seconds|which|lasted|a|long|time|for|me|.|But|yeah|it|probably|sounds|dumb|,|but|I|couldn't|tell|if|I|was|about|to|die|or|something|so|it|made|me|panic|a|lot|.|I|am|kindve|convinced|that|this|may|have|been|a|seizure|,|but|I|don't|think|I've|ever|had|one|so|I'm|not|sure|what|a|seizure|is|truly|like|based|off|the|Internet|.|Anyways|that|happened|at|around|1AM|and|I|couldn't|fall|asleep|again|because|I|was|very|scared|and|considered|waking|up|my|parents|(|I'm|17|)|but|figured|I'll|wait|for|tomorrow|.|I|started|to|get|these|head|rushes|again|while|trying|to|fall|asleep|,|so|I|didn't|fall|asleep|until|probably|around|3:30|and|woke|up|at|7|and|didn't|feel|tired|at|all|,|probably|just|cuz|it's|the|only|thing|non|my|mind|.|MS|is|something|I|thought|I|had|a|while|back|because|of|the|pins|and|needles|,|head|rushes|,|fatigue|I|would|get|.|I|tried|to|brush|it|off|and|convince|myself|it|was|just|anxiety|getting|the|best|of|me|.|But|now|I|just|had|that|supposed|“|seizure|”|which|is|supposed|to|be|common|in|people|with|ms|.|Another|thing|I've|noticed|recently|is|that|I've|been|tending|to|have|short|term|memory|loss|I|guess|,|like|I|would|think|of|a|video|to|search|up|on|YouTube|,|then|5|seconds|later|forget|what|the|video|I|was|thinking|of|was|called|.|I|would|just|like|to|get|your|guys|input|because|my|parents|will|just|say|I'm|reading|to|much|stuff|on|the|internet|if|I|approach|them|about|it|,|but|they|don't|know|what|I've|been|feeling|.|Anyways|thanks|in|advance|,|I|probably|wrote|this|poorly|since|I'm|on|my|iPhone|,|but|I|hope|it|gets|the|point|across|.

I always thought I'd be the work-til-I-die type like my parents and grandfather (my grandpa died at work), but the fatigue, numbness, pain, and all around HEAVINESS that comes with MS has left me almost bed-ridden. I can't make it out of my apartment anymore without assistance, I feel half-asleep 24/7 even with the Modafinil. can't feel the left side of my body at all and have a giant burn on my forearm to prove it that I gave myself a couple days ago while cooking. Scariest part is I didn't even FEEL it when it happened, I only found out waking up the next morning with a giant, ugly blister and no recollection of how it could've gotten there. I feel like my body is slowly breaking down and I'm only 25 years old. I'm happy and relieved I can stop thinking about money but I miss feeling useful. I want to eventually go back to my 40+ hour-a-week rat race job, but a tiny voice in the back of my head is telling me I can't. I don't know if there's a hell, but this certainly feels close. 	1	1	I|got|approved|for|short-term|disability|!|It's|bittersweet|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4713193264368721568/Pros-and-Cons-of-participating-in-a-clinical-trial	Pros and Cons of participating in a clinical trial	Please let me know if this post doesn't quite follow the rules, it's my very first Reddit post! I was dx'ed almost 4 years ago with RRMS. I've had no progression on MRIs since then, and by all accounts my neurologist has deemed me -lovingly - a boring patient. My symptoms are mild for the most part, mostly the fatigue, spasticity and RLS type. My neuro recently asked me if I would be interested in participating in a clinical trial for a new medicine that would be potentially restorative therapy. Here's what I know: It's phase 2 of the trial, and only about 20 people participated in the phase 1 stage. It's a double blind, placebo controlled study that would last about 2 years. Because my case of MS is so “boring” there's the opinion that I would be unlikely (but not impossible) to benefit from the potentially restorative therapy, and my participation would be more in the line of the “helping humankind”. They need people in all sorts of stages to participate in the study, I would guess. Here are my questions: 1. Has anyone participated in a clinical trial before? 2. What might I expect in terms of medical care? 3. Would I have to sign some sort of release of liability if my condition worsened or the side effects were severe? I imagine if I did experience severe side effects, the medical team would treat those side effects. Would I be financially responsible for this treatment? 4. What would be the pros and cons of participating that I may not immediately think of? Other than helping humankind and possibly contributing to the advancement of treatments and progress toward a cure one day, which, I think is incredibly awesome to be a part of... I'm leaning towards participating, but having very little knowledge about clinical trials, I'm uncertain.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4710951875209125632/confused,-I-think?	confused, I think?	Hi, everyone. I'm newly diagnosed, and I had my first Tysabri infusion on Tuesday. I had a urinary tract infection last month, and I told my primary care doctor about some urinary symptoms I've been having, and she told me to tell my neurologist. Well I told him yesterday at my appointment, and he said that the urine sample that she took had a high level of sugar. He ordered blood work to see where my sugar levels are, and while this is perfectly okay and I think this is a good idea, I'm just wondering why my neuro would be doing this and not my primary care doctor. I guess I'm also just confused about why my primary care doctor didn't mention this to me, especially if it is an area of concern. To be honest, I'm not really sure what I'm asking. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has had any other experiences with high sugar diabetes and their MS. 	1	1	confused|,|I|think|?

I'm still very active and I do what I can to keep the scary stuff to myself. I've been losing words a little lately, and my WBC count is really low and I've been so tired and irritated lately. Over the past week, my bf said he needed time to think through if he could be in a relationship, I've had bouts of vertigo, I am waiting for “memory testing” through my neuro office, and I'm in an incredibly stressful time at work, with a shitty manager. I'm melting down. Considering trying to take short term disability for a few weeks but I don't want to use up all my paid time off so early in the year. I don't even know what I'm asking for here.

How did you get diagnosed with MS, I’m starting to wonder if I have it, I have long list of issues and think fit the symptoms but no docs have suggested it, wondering if I should or if they’ll think I’m a hypochondriac... if I had it wouldn’t a doc have suggested it by now?	Not sure if I'm just grasping at straws that it might be the reason as I'm on the edge, cheers for any advice! Brief info: chronic joint pain and exhaustion since early teen (now 27wtf), having to do eye exercises because my eyes have gotten really weak (short sighted but that is unrelated to eye problem don't know why eyes got weak get double vision and blurry a lot but eye exercises sort of helping, have oopthritis (inflamed ovary no reason why but gives me daily cramps and messed up my periods), get really severe headaches and migraines, very sore all the time, I get numbness and pins and needles often, bowel issues joyjoy, doing AIP to try and help which I think it has a bit. When I'm in loads of pain I uncontrollably twitch which is super annoying. I'm in so much pain all the time and so exhausted it's really difficult. Also when I'm in loads of pain I get really weak like struggle to hold a pen, fork etc. And sometimes legs just give way, I wear insoles and boots to avoid rolling over on my ankles as I do a lot in normal footwear even trainers. I take codeine daily for years for pain and am on antiimflammatories for RA and take an antidepressant but not for depression it's as a muscle relaxant to help me sleep and less twitches (but I have not found that it helps but my doc want to increase if I don't think it helps so I said it's fine as is as it give me brain fog on current dosage & if it's not helped at all I don't think increasing it will help. ) Cheers for any advice sorry for long list probably not even listed everything but you get the point generally bad time all round just want a solution, treatment that really helps rather than just slightly mask it, I'm in unbearable pain most days and quite often on edge from the exhaustion and pain of it all. 	1	1	How|did|you|get|diagnosed|with|MS|,|I|’|m|starting|to|wonder|if|I|have|it|,|I|have|long|list|of|issues|and|think|fit|the|symptoms|but|no|docs|have|suggested|it|,|wondering|if|I|should|or|if|they|’|ll|think|I|’|m|a|hypochondriac|...|if|I|had|it|wouldn|’|t|a|doc|have|suggested|it|by|now|?

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned against the use of plasma transfusions from young donors to alleviate or treat the symptoms of multiple sclerosis or other diseases, noting such transfusions have no proven clinical benefit and carry known health risks associated with their use. Plasma is the liquid component of blood, containing proteins that help in clotting, and can be used to treat bleeding disorders and cases of trauma. But its use in transfusions as a means of treating conditions ranging from multiple sclerosis, dementia, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, heart disease and post-traumatic stress disorder are of concern, the FDA said in issuing its statement of Feb 19. . “We have significant public health concerns about the promotion and use of plasma for these purposes,” the FDA statement reads. “[W]e're alerting consumers and health care providers that treatments using plasma from young donors have not gone through the rigorous testing …. [necessary] to confirm the therapeutic benefit of a product and to ensure its safety.” Scott Gottlieb, the FDA's commissioner, and Peter Marks, director of its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, jointly issued the statement cautioning healthcare providers and the public that plasma infusions — being done at “a growing number of clinics” in several U.S. states — are not an FDA-approved or recognized treatment for aging, memory loss, multiple sclerosis, or other diseases. FDA-approved treatments largely come through clinical trials overseen by researchers and independent boards, and performed under an investigational new drug (IND) application that helps to ensure patient safety. “Our concerns regarding treatments using plasma from young donors are heightened by the fact that there is no compelling clinical evidence on its efficacy, nor is there information on appropriate dosing for treatment of the conditions for which these products are being advertised,” the statement notes. According to the FDA, large volumes of plasma might be also be needed for such transfusions and that volume can pose significant risks, including allergic reactions, infections, and heart and respiratory problems. The agency also expressed concern that such transfusions could discourage patients from taking medications or other treatments known to be safe and effective for their condition. According to the agency, some “establishments” across the country are recommending young donor plasma infusions and “touting” them “as cures and remedies,” while sometimes “charging thousands of dollars.” The FDA advises patients to consult with their treating physician before opting for any treatment to confirm that it is approved for use, meaning its safety and effectiveness have been demonstrated. “Simply put, we're concerned that some patients are being preyed upon by unscrupulous actors touting treatments of plasma from young donors,” the FDA statement reads. It also asks that patients who have undergone a plasma transfusion report any ill effects to its MedWatch program, which tracks adverse events related to treatments. 	1	0	FDA|Warns|Against|Plasma|Transfusions|Being|Used|to|Treat|MS|and|Other|Diseases|at|Sites|in|US	edit|:|i|also|see|[|there|is|this|article|in|jama|]|(|https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/791730|)|that|talks|about|its|moa|and|cites|other|studies|...|1|.|i|am|swamped|so|i|hope|to|read|more|about|this|later|,|just|quickly|googled|and|pasted|2|.|maybe|someone|with|a|science|/|research|bkgrd|can|opine|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2019/02/21/fda-warns-against-plasma-transfusions-being-used-to-treat-ms-and-other-diseases-at-sites-in-us/|FDA|Warns|Against|Plasma|Transfusions|Being|Used|to|Treat|MS|and|Other|Diseases|at|Sites|in|US|FEBRUARY|21|,|2019|BY|VIJAYA|IYER|IN|NEWS|.|The|U|.|S|.|Food|and|Drug|Administration|(|FDA|)|has|warned|against|the|use|of|plasma|transfusions|from|young|donors|to|alleviate|or|treat|the|symptoms|of|multiple|sclerosis|or|other|diseases|,|noting|such|transfusions|have|no|proven|clinical|benefit|and|carry|known|health|risks|associated|with|their|use|.|Plasma|is|the|liquid|component|of|blood|,|containing|proteins|that|help|in|clotting|,|and|can|be|used|to|treat|bleeding|disorders|and|cases|of|trauma|.|But|its|use|in|transfusions|as|a|means|of|treating|conditions|ranging|from|multiple|sclerosis|,|dementia|,|Alzheimer's|,|Parkinson's|,|heart|disease|and|post-traumatic|stress|disorder|are|of|concern|,|the|FDA|said|in|issuing|its|statement|of|Feb|19|. .|“|We|have|significant|public|health|concerns|about|the|promotion|and|use|of|plasma|for|these|purposes|,|”|the|FDA|statement|reads|.|“|[|W|]|e're|alerting|consumers|and|health|care|providers|that|treatments|using|plasma|from|young|donors|have|not|gone|through|the|rigorous|testing|…|.|[|necessary|]|to|confirm|the|therapeutic|benefit|of|a|product|and|to|ensure|its|safety|.|”|Scott|Gottlieb|,|the|FDA's|commissioner|,|and|Peter|Marks|,|director|of|its|Center|for|Biologics|Evaluation|and|Research|,|jointly|issued|the|statement|cautioning|healthcare|providers|and|the|public|that|plasma|infusions|—|being|done|at|“|a|growing|number|of|clinics|”|in|several|U|.|S|.|states|—|are|not|an|FDA-approved|or|recognized|treatment|for|aging|,|memory|loss|,|multiple|sclerosis|,|or|other|diseases|.|FDA-approved|treatments|largely|come|through|clinical|trials|overseen|by|researchers|and|independent|boards|,|and|performed|under|an|investigational|new|drug|(|IND|)|application|that|helps|to|ensure|patient|safety|.|“|Our|concerns|regarding|treatments|using|plasma|from|young|donors|are|heightened|by|the|fact|that|there|is|no|compelling|clinical|evidence|on|its|efficacy|,|nor|is|there|information|on|appropriate|dosing|for|treatment|of|the|conditions|for|which|these|products|are|being|advertised|,|”|the|statement|notes|.|According|to|the|FDA|,|large|volumes|of|plasma|might|be|also|be|needed|for|such|transfusions|and|that|volume|can|pose|significant|risks|,|including|allergic|reactions|,|infections|,|and|heart|and|respiratory|problems|.|The|agency|also|expressed|concern|that|such|transfusions|could|discourage|patients|from|taking|medications|or|other|treatments|known|to|be|safe|and|effective|for|their|condition|.|According|to|the|agency|,|some|“|establishments|”|across|the|country|are|recommending|young|donor|plasma|infusions|and|“|touting|”|them|“|as|cures|and|remedies|,|”|while|sometimes|“|charging|thousands|of|dollars|.|”|The|FDA|advises|patients|to|consult|with|their|treating|physician|before|opting|for|any|treatment|to|confirm|that|it|is|approved|for|use|,|meaning|its|safety|and|effectiveness|have|been|demonstrated|.|“|Simply|put|,|we're|concerned|that|some|patients|are|being|preyed|upon|by|unscrupulous|actors|touting|treatments|of|plasma|from|young|donors|,|”|the|FDA|statement|reads|.|It|also|asks|that|patients|who|have|undergone|a|plasma|transfusion|report|any|ill|effects|to|its|MedWatch|program|,|which|tracks|adverse|events|related|to|treatments|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4709961093962571551/I-was-told-yesterday-that-I-had-a-lesion-on-my-brain-from-an-MRI-8-months-ago	I was told yesterday that I had a lesion on my brain from an MRI 8 months ago	"Last year, almost a year to the day, I started having problems with back pain and bladder spasms. Fast forward 2 months and I could barely walk around without feeling exhausted. Luckily, after that, I got better and I decided to go to a neurologist to see if it was MS or some other disease. At my neurologist's advice, I had an MRI done and he told me that nothing had been found, then I had another one a month later and he said ""nothing of importance"". I then had a spinal tap to see if we could finally figure out what had caused this and left me with a bad bladder and fatigue, and that too showed nothing. Yesterday morning I met with a different neurologist, as my old one had moved states, and towards the end of the appointment was told: ""so you do know that you have a lesion in your brain right?"". I was completely flabbergasted when he said this, he then pulled up my old MRIs from last year and showed me the lesion that was on both. My new neurologist then told me that while this didn't prove MS at all, but that it definitely lent me to being a high-risk CIS patient. During these last few months since I had that spinal tap, I had come to terms with that my anxiety must have caused all these symptoms, and that I needed to learn to ignore what my body tells me some times. For many months I hated myself because I had wasted all this money and time on something that I could have gone to a psychologist for! But now, I have to quickly come to terms with the very real possibility of having this illness, either now or in the near future. I now have to accept that I should listen to my bodies complaints or I could cause future damage. I am so hurt and upset by this revelation and I don't know how to proceed. I am having an MRI of my middle back in early March and a VEP. This is all compounding with the fact that I have been feeling worse in the last few weeks, but I had choked it up to school getting more challenging and seasonal depression. I feel so lost and helpless at this point that I had been misled this way. (Thank you for getting to the bottom of this) TL:DR: Old MRI showed lesion on my brain but old neurologist did not tell me, the new neurologist did tell me; I am very upset about this.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4709961093965835559/My-other-half-has-MS,-hes-had-his-treatment-changed-and-I-dont-know-how-to-help-or-what-to-do	My other half has MS, he’s had his treatment changed and I don’t know how to help or what to do	So I've been with my other half a few years now, I've known about the MS from day one, he got diagnosed 5 years ago and was upfront with me from the start about it and told me he had it, I didn't care he had it as it changed nothing about how I felt about him and I wanted to get to know him. I guess I'm asking on here so I understand better because at the end of the day as much as I try, I can't fully understand something I don't have. He was on tysabril for as long as I've been with him, but recently his neurologist has advised he's showing high risk anti JC (?) so they've proposed to move him to something called fingolimoid (i apologise if I'm getting the names wrong, I only know as much as he chooses to share) - my understanding of this stuff is that it pretty much wears you down and he needs monitoring on day one and then I read some stuff about him potentially getting PML as well. Of course it's scary, he puts on a brave face but I know it must be killing him inside, and I feel so helpless because I don't know what to do. He wants to be put on some stem cell transplant but they've advised he's not eligible. Now all of this - I'm prepared to support him through everything, I just want him to be happy, but he's a proud man and doesn't always share everything - in a recent conversation with his family I mentioned his treatment change and quickly realised he hadn't shared this information with them, which led to me not being able to look anyone in the eye as he lied and told his family he chose to make this decision because he was “bored” of the previous treatment. Now I get the MS is his thing and I have to let him do his thing and figure things out, but I guess what I'm asking is: 1. Should I do more to encourage him to talk about it? 2. I hate lying, and I know it's his right to tell his family, but what if something happens to him? I'd feel awful if they then found out he hid this - I know they'd just worry, but is it best they know as well? I'd get it if he didn't want anything to with his family, but they love him with all their heart as does he so I feel like a bit of an impostor, I can't imagine how much it'd hurt if I found out my future child hid something like this from me 3. What do your partners do to help you deal with this? I know I can't cure anything, but I just want to make him feel better anyway I can I think since this change of treatment, it's dawned on me I might lose him one day and it's breaking my heart. I don't know what to expect or when, I'm worried something will happen to him but I put on this face so he doesn't feel it, for the first time last week I broke into tears in front of him because of it and every time I think about this I cry because I don't know what to do - I know I sound pathetic but if hearing about this just makes me cry I can only imagine how bad he must feel living with it. I'd really appreciate all the tips and advice Thanks. 	1	1	My|other|half|has|MS|,|he|’|s|had|his|treatment|changed|and|I|don|’|t|know|how|to|help|or|what|to|do	So|I've|been|with|my|other|half|a|few|years|now|,|I've|known|about|the|MS|from|day|one|,|he|got|diagnosed|5|years|ago|and|was|upfront|with|me|from|the|start|about|it|and|told|me|he|had|it|,|I|didn't|care|he|had|it|as|it|changed|nothing|about|how|I|felt|about|him|and|I|wanted|to|get|to|know|him|.|I|guess|I'm|asking|on|here|so|I|understand|better|because|at|the|end|of|the|day|as|much|as|I|try|,|I|can't|fully|understand|something|I|don't|have|.|He|was|on|tysabril|for|as|long|as|I've|been|with|him|,|but|recently|his|neurologist|has|advised|he's|showing|high|risk|anti|JC|(|?|)|so|they've|proposed|to|move|him|to|something|called|fingolimoid|(|i|apologise|if|I'm|getting|the|names|wrong|,|I|only|know|as|much|as|he|chooses|to|share|)|-|my|understanding|of|this|stuff|is|that|it|pretty|much|wears|you|down|and|he|needs|monitoring|on|day|one|and|then|I|read|some|stuff|about|him|potentially|getting|PML|as|well|.|Of|course|it's|scary|,|he|puts|on|a|brave|face|but|I|know|it|must|be|killing|him|inside|,|and|I|feel|so|helpless|because|I|don't|know|what|to|do|.|He|wants|to|be|put|on|some|stem|cell|transplant|but|they've|advised|he's|not|eligible|.|Now|all|of|this|-|I'm|prepared|to|support|him|through|everything|,|I|just|want|him|to|be|happy|,|but|he's|a|proud|man|and|doesn't|always|share|everything|-|in|a|recent|conversation|with|his|family|I|mentioned|his|treatment|change|and|quickly|realised|he|hadn't|shared|this|information|with|them|,|which|led|to|me|not|being|able|to|look|anyone|in|the|eye|as|he|lied|and|told|his|family|he|chose|to|make|this|decision|because|he|was|“|bored|”|of|the|previous|treatment|.|Now|I|get|the|MS|is|his|thing|and|I|have|to|let|him|do|his|thing|and|figure|things|out|,|but|I|guess|what|I'm|asking|is|:|1|.|Should|I|do|more|to|encourage|him|to|talk|about|it|?|2|.|I|hate|lying|,|and|I|know|it's|his|right|to|tell|his|family|,|but|what|if|something|happens|to|him|?|I'd|feel|awful|if|they|then|found|out|he|hid|this|-|I|know|they'd|just|worry|,|but|is|it|best|they|know|as|well|?|I'd|get|it|if|he|didn't|want|anything|to|with|his|family|,|but|they|love|him|with|all|their|heart|as|does|he|so|I|feel|like|a|bit|of|an|impostor|,|I|can't|imagine|how|much|it'd|hurt|if|I|found|out|my|future|child|hid|something|like|this|from|me|3|.|What|do|your|partners|do|to|help|you|deal|with|this|?|I|know|I|can't|cure|anything|,|but|I|just|want|to|make|him|feel|better|anyway|I|can|I|think|since|this|change|of|treatment|,|it's|dawned|on|me|I|might|lose|him|one|day|and|it's|breaking|my|heart|.|I|don't|know|what|to|expect|or|when|,|I'm|worried|something|will|happen|to|him|but|I|put|on|this|face|so|he|doesn't|feel|it|,|for|the|first|time|last|week|I|broke|into|tears|in|front|of|him|because|of|it|and|every|time|I|think|about|this|I|cry|because|I|don't|know|what|to|do|-|I|know|I|sound|pathetic|but|if|hearing|about|this|just|makes|me|cry|I|can|only|imagine|how|bad|he|must|feel|living|with|it|.|I'd|really|appreciate|all|the|tips|and|advice|Thanks|.

A clinical trial to test the effects of antioxidant treatment with lipoic acid on progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) is recruiting 118 participants at seven sites in North America. The study sites include: Birmingham, Alabama; Burlington, Vermont; Portland, Oregon; Salt Lake City, Utah; Seattle, Washington; Washington, D.C., and; Ontario, Canada. Although results from studies testing the effect of lipoic acid (also known as alpha lipoic acid) on MS vary, some studies have shown immune-regulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of lipoic acid. While its exact mechanism of action is unclear, studies suggest that lipoic acid blocks so-called free radicals (atoms, ions, or molecules with high chemical reactivity) derived from oxygen, called reactive oxygen species. These reactive oxygen species are normal byproducts of bodily processes. However, an excess of oxygen-derived free radicals can cause tissue injury or trigger immune cell reactions associated with MS. The current clinical trial (NCT03161028) is based on results from a study, “Lipoic acid in secondary progressive MS: A randomized controlled pilot trial,” published in the journal Neurology Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation. In the study, 51 participants (age range, 40-70) with secondary progressive MS received either daily oral 1,200 mg lipoic acid (27 participants) or placebo (24 participants) for two years. Results showed that participants treated with lipoic acid had a 68 percent reduction in brain tissue loss (brain atrophy, or shrinkage) compared with participants receiving placebo. Now, the new clinical trial will assess the potential benefits and safety of lipoic acid treatment on 118 randomly assigned participants between 18 and 70 years of age, with primary or secondary progressive MS, who are able to walk with or without a walking aid. Half of the participants will receive oral lipoic acid (1,200 mg), and the other half will receive placebo daily for two years. At the trial's seven sites, researchers will compare mobility functions between baseline (start of trial) and each subsequent visit. The trial's primary goal is a change in timed 25-foot walk from baseline, with or without walking aid, which is a measure of patients' mobility and leg function performance. Secondary outcomes include changes in: the two-minute walk test, the recorded number of falls during the trial period, brain volume seen through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and treatment safety. The National MS Society and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are the main sponsors of the clinical trial.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4709654230285752377/LP-soon,-looking-for-wisdom-and-next-steps.	LP soon, looking for wisdom and next steps.	"I am getting a LP in a couple weeks to ""rule out MS"". I am, at a minimum, grateful that these symptoms have arisen in my life as they've made me aware of MS when I knew next to nothing 2 months ago. I am a little confused about a few things and thought I'd pose my questions to you kind people who know best. Thank you for having me.   Here's a little of my backstory and my situation:   I am a 26 yr old female. In mid-December I stayed home from work 2 days in a row because I was so dizzy I couldn't stand it. Not vertigo, though. I started to lose my balance (falling over) and had horrible tinnitus, felt like my intelligence was cut in half, and at one point, my lips started buzzing! Saw an ENT who sent my down for an urgent brain MRI with and without contrast - brain MRI was clear. ENT referred me to a neurologist.   BUT - that night, my legs started to completely give out - they were so weak that I couldn't take more than a few steps. Looking at light hurt my eyes. My legs didn't work in the AM either. I called my ENT back to ask about the neurologist and he told me to go to the ER right away. My boyfriend had to carry my weight as we hobbled in.   At the hospital I started experiencing what they told me was ""abdominal myoclonus"" - my abs were spasming and it looked like my body was convulsing. I was in no pain other than the muscle workout. I still couldn't walk due to both leg weakness and poor balance and the spasms. I was also told that I had a ""borderline abnormal EKG - possible left atrial enlargement"" if that matters. I saw so many neurologists at this teaching hospital, all of whom mentioned MS but obviously weren't sure - they wanted a cervical MRI. After 2 days, it was just before Christmas and they told me that it would be very difficult to get the spine MRI that they wanted because they were so short-staffed. I left after 3 days and VERY SLOWLY practiced walking around my house - that took about a week to get back to ""normal"".   When I finally saw my neuro in early January, he ordered a full spine MRI, all of which was completely clear. He was surprised that it was clear after seeing the videos of what was going on in my abs. He ordered an EMG, which he said was ""mostly normal"" with the exception of a conduction delay in my sural nerve. He is now ordering a LP. I don't \*want\* to do a spinal tap, especially when I feel mostly normal, though still disturbed by not knowing what happened in that episode (part of me wants to pretend it never happened). I tried to get out of it, but my neuro really wants it done and I suppose after learning more about MS, I'd rather know now if that's what my future holds.   I still struggle to walk in a straight line, heel to toe, but other than that I am pretty normal aside from a couple episodes of numbness in my feet and legs, absolutely non-stop tingling and twitching on the bottom of my right foot, random muscle twitches all over my body, random ""zaps""/mild electrical shocks in my legs, feeling like my feet/legs are SUPER hot or SUPER cold, occasional VERY SLOW walking, my left hand feeling like it wants to close, my leg shaking (looks like from weakness but it doesn't feel weak) when driving, and ankle shaking. I read someone's comment on this subreddit that they felt like they were being ""gaslighted by their own body"" - that's how I feel. Especially when a part of me at this point is thinking, ""well, I have clear MRIs, so maybe this really is just stress related!""   Things that have been ""ruled out"" or at least tested with no reason to dig deeper: HIV, lead poisoning, thyroid issues, B12, basic ANA, conversion disorder, anything else included in basic bloodwork.   **My questions are thus:**   1) My neuro (who is MS specialist) claims that some people's bodies are capable of ""healing"" their lesions, resulting in clear MRIs. Does anyone have experience with this?   2) My neuro explained that lesions are a result of the nerve damage, not the cause. Is it really possible that the day before this episode got really bad I had no lesions and now I will have lesions? Or evidence of lesions?   3) Do you think the LP makes sense as the next logical step? It's definitely worth going through with? Again, it might be me in denial/wishing this hadn't happened.   4) Is there still a possibility that this LP will leave me in diagnostic limbo with respect to MS? Or are the CSF testing criteria going to be able to say yes MS or no MS?   Thank you, times a million, for listening to me and facilitating a space where I can ask these questions.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4709607762440458569/MS--Work---a-couple-of-anecdotes	MS @ Work - a couple of anecdotes	"These are just anecdotes and not a heavy post. 1. When I told my friend, who happens to manage an organization with \~50 employees in our larger department, he mentioned there is one person in his org that was recently diagnosed. Understanding the need for anonymity in this situation, I asked him to tell the person my name so he or she can reach out to me if desired. I never heard from him. I later found out who it is from his teammates, and I found out that he knows I'm the other one in the area. However, he won't even make eye contact with me. I recently found out that he's not even getting treatment at all, even though our insurance is amazing. He has told someone on his team that he doesn't want to deal with it. This makes me sad. Since he won't make eye contact with me, I'm free to observe him. He shows no sign of MS in his walking, and I see nothing else to indicate how he's doing. I badly want to just have mutual acknowledgement of our shared situation, but I can't even really ack that I know. Anyway... I'm letting it drop. It's on him to come to me if he's interested. He knows who I am, so I will leave it at that. 2. There is another gentleman at work (works in an entirely different area so I don't see him often) who I think has MS. He has what I think of as a distinctive MS walk. He swings his leg out to the side a bit and has a general mild limp. Anyway, last time I saw him, I just wanted to say, ""Hey! You walk like I do! I wonder if we have the same condition!"" 3. There is ANOTHER gentleman at work who works across campus in another building. Anyway, I saw him recently and he had those braces that go inside your shoe and part way up your shin. I forget what they are called, but they basically (as I understand it) prevent foot drop from tripping you up. I wanted to run up to him and say something like, ""Hey! I know what THOSE are! I wonder if we have the same condition!""   I guess I'm MS lonely, but at least I have y'all.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4709536267873987736/Annoyed...	Annoyed...	Morning everyone! I was diagnosed Fall 2017, been having disagreements with the Army Reserves since. Deployed twice exposed to burn pits and black mold (reno of a dining facility in bumfuck Afghanistan) The RN that worked for LHI (federal contractor in charge of medical for the Army Reserve) told me I would have gotten MS regardless of my service. I don't agree with this statement as you cannot say that. Medical issues are complex and boiling stuff down to black and white is asinine. I am a Native American male which does not put me in the “at risk” category. (I know there is research being done that says there is a genetic factor with a “trigger”. ) Anywho, because I did not get diagnosed on Active Duty they are saying it is non-duty related. I have been to Afghanistan twice and before the diagnosis I was at a leadership school and collapsed during PT. The Army doc told me my boots were too tight. I had just returned from my second deployment. I did not agree. I was then sent back to the school and told to follow up with a civilian neurologist after. I had to wait 4.5 months because civilian side health systems require a referral. It took a month to get the referral then the diagnosis. Switched to the VA upon expiration of Tricare Prime and my neurologist is not good at the VA. I was put on rebif had major depression and he kept quiet. I then had new spots on my MRI and developed new symptoms. Quiet still. I advocated for Ocrevus after reading how well the drug is performing. The VA Neurologist told me PML is a real risk when using Ocrevus. Yes, PML is a thing and Ocrevus can activate it but this has not been seen. Long story short I finally was prescribed Ocrevus. That's the back story. Now while on Ocrevus immunizations are a no-go. I am in Nursing School and clinical rotations require up-to-date immunizations. The yearly flu shot is my question. I am good for this year but next year is what my question is about. The Neurologist says he does not see why I couldn't get immunization shots and said to follow up with pharmacy. !!!!!!! I need a letter from him stating immunizations are not authorized while on Ocrevus. At this point I am extremely frustrated and hate everyone. 	1	1	Annoyed|...

A protein called Satb1 appears to be the “on switch” that turns a type of T-cell called Th17 from its typical protective role into one that is disease-causing, and key in the development of multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory autoimmune disorders, a study reports. These findings suggest that Satb1 may be a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases like MS. Immune cells called T-helper 17 cells play a range of roles in immunity, including protecting against infecting pathogens — bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that can cause disease. But Th17 cells are also players in the development of such autoimmune diseases as MS, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. This is because Th17 cells can be stimulated to become T-cells that engage in pathogenic, or disease-causing, immune programs. How Th17 cells switch from their typical and helpful immunity role to that of a pathogenic actor has not been resolved, although it is thought critical to treating inflammatory autoimmune diseases. An international team led by researchers at Osaka University and Kyoto University, in Japan, tried to identify the mechanism behind the disease-causing program of Th17 cells. To do so, they built upon previous findings showing that a protein regulator called Satb1 is important in the development of Th17 cell subsets. “We have known for some time that Satb1 is indispensable for the development of T-cells in the thymus. However, how it is involved in the regulation of pathogenic processes of Th17 cells in inflamed tissues had not been examined,” Keiko Yasuda, MD, the study's lead author, said in a press release. Researchers used a standard mouse model of MS, called experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. These animals had genetically-modified Th17 cells that lacked Satb1. Researchers tested how Th17 cells lacking Satb1 acted when subject to inflammatory conditions, and how they were stimulated to activate a “pathogenic effector program.” Interestingly, these modified mice were resistant to the development of EAE, or MS-like, disease. Researchers saw fewer Th17 cells infiltrating the animals' spinal cord. Also, Th17 cells lacking Satb1 showed poorer production of key pathogenic signaling molecules in autoimmunity, notably one called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF is known to cause localized tissue inflammation in MS and other inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Researchers went on to show that Satb1 can act as a switch between benign and pathogenic Th17 cells, depending on their exposure to healthy or inflammatory conditions. They found molecules that boost the pathogenicity of Th17 cells, such as Bhlhe40, and molecules that promote normal immune function, such as PD-1. Of note, PD-1 is shut down when Th17 cells engage in their pathogenic effector program. These results showed Satb1 to be a key regulator of Th17 cell pathogenicity in these MS mice. Halting Th17 cells from making Satb1 may offer a way of treatting various autoimmune diseases. “Together, our findings, in addition to providing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenic program of tissue Th17 cells in mice, may help design novel immunotherapeutic approaches such as small molecule modifiers of Satb1 for the treatment of autoimmune diseases,” the researchers wrote. Future studies are needed to confirm these results in people. A previous study in people also suggested a link between Satb1 and the pathogenic function of Th17 cells in the central nervous system of MS patients. Overall, “our results suggest that manipulating Satb1 gene expression in Th17 cells could form the basis of novel treatments for various autoimmune diseases caused by Th17 cells. If we can prevent the pathogenic processes of Th17 cells, we may be able to alleviate or even eliminate disease symptoms,” concluded Shimon Sakaguchi, PhD, one of the study's senior authors. edit: Journal Reference: [Keiko Yasuda, Yohko Kitagawa, Ryoji Kawakami, Yoshitaka Isaka, Hitomi Watanabe, Gen Kondoh, Terumi Kohwi-Shigematsu, Shimon Sakaguchi, Keiji Hirota.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4709477308584978105/The-fuck-now,-ya'll?	The fuck now, ya'll?	"ETA- I've spoken to my neuro, everything is 100% legit. I am getting the big O next Thursday, the 21st. I had to push it back a week, I've got a nasty sinus infection and am on some antibiotics. My last visit, my neuro had bloodwork done that I thought was just to check my vitamin levels, but he also screened me again for all the other shit they check for. Thank you everyone for their kind words of support and advice, this place is amazing. Even on days I don't post or comment, I read things here and it helps me feel so much less alone. We are in this together, and I love all of you! So I've posted here before, short background- I'm a 30 year old female, diagnosed with PPMS last June, fighting with state issued insurance to get Ocrevus. There are a lot of days I can barely get out of bed, I'm on a ton of meds for my symptoms. My insurance denied the Ocrevus, my doc said okay, you might have to take tecfidera first. Insurance denied that, they want me to take two other meds for three months each, then six months of tec, then maybe they'll think about the big O. I had my checkup with my neuro at the beginning of the month, on the 1st. No new lesions on my MRI, which is good, but one of my ""deep lesions is deeper,"" which is bad. I had a break down in my neuro's office. I've got other shit going on in my life, and I'm stressed to the breaking point. So I broke. The doc couldn't even finish the physical exam, because I was spasming. Now, my neurologist is an MS specialist, he is very busy, he has a lot of patients. It's hard to get a call back from him. In person, he is amazing. He sat on the floor next to my sobbing ass (I'm a messy crier, guys I had snot all over my face), and promised me that he was going to help me get around my insurance. He told me the big O is the only thing that has a chance of helping me, and he is going to fight tooth and nail to help me get it. Wonderful. He's also going to write a detailed report for my disability claim, which was denied because, and I quote, ""[my name] still has use of her arms and legs sometimes."" Wonderful. He had me sign permissions for both tecfidera and ocevurus, and promised me that in a month or two I'd be on something, even if he had to steal it and bring it to my house himself. Anyway, Friday afternoon I get a call from the hospital to schedule my first ocevurus infusion this Thursday. Out of nowhere, I get this call. At first, I'm beyond elated. Finally, some good news! But, here's the thing. I asked when they scheduled if I needed anymore blood work, what I have to do, etc. They told me to call my neuro and ask him. Okay. I asked about my insurance. They said gentech told them to schedule it. I called gentech, I called my neuro, left messages at both places. Here in the states it's president's day, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to get ahold of anyone til tomorrow. I don't know if it's my anxiety kicking into overdrive, or what, but I'm afraid this isn't going to happen. I'm afraid it's going to get snatched away, again. I just want to make sure I'm really getting this, it's been so long and such a long fight, I don't want to show up Thursday and be told I have to get tests done first, I don't want my insurance to fuck me over more, I'm honestly more terrified than I've been since my diagnosis. How can they just call me, out of practically nowhere, with this, and expect me to believe it? I want this to be legit. I need this. I'm so paranoid that this is just another dangling carrot, and I just need to know what else I should be asking. Or if I'm just so jaded with everything that I can't accept the fact that something may be going my way, for once. The fuck I do now? "	1	1	The|fuck|now|,|ya'll|?

I am 29F. I'm single and now thinking my dating life, potentially getting married and having children are out of my future. Why would anyone want to deal with this? Some days I cant get out of bed. I have to cancel plans or forego making plans because I dont know how I will feel. My friends and family dont know how to comfort me or give me moral support so I feel so alone. Up until 2 weeks ago I was very active, always traveling and working out, being social, and recently landed my dream job. Now I am so fatigued I can barely function.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4709005425394349290/A-tip-for-restless-leg-syndrome-and-demyelination-of-relapse-remit,-how-to-possibly-get-sleep-when-the-microglial-inflammation-occurs.	A tip for restless leg syndrome and demyelination of relapse remit, how to possibly get sleep when the microglial inflammation occurs.	I am the SO of an individual with ms relapse remit, there have been so many nights of sleeplessness and tossing and turning that, at times I feel like a zombie. I love my SO and the amount of commitment I often put into the relationship is reflected by how we help one another. I am schizophrenic and my SO suffers from ms. So I do research to determine if I can think of new strategies and coping methods whenever a new study arises. My SO has extreme ‘flare ups' as her doctor has told her this may happen on occasion. When these flair ups occur it's a glial population density that will often cause a dead tingling sensation in her feet. Thanks to a recent study I believe I have discovered a new method to treat rls based on how oligodendrocytes behave and are activated in the body. [This is the study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190122114918.htm) that made me realize that [combined with this 2006 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pmc/articles/PMC1451213/) I drew the conclusion that oligodendrocyte attenuation could be activated by a very specific procedure. This may not work for all multiple sclerosis patients especially outside rr. Yet, if this method helps one other person the research will have been worth it. To explain the details and amount of research I have done would be over-exhausting to us both and me twice over so I'll summarize. When demyelination occurs T cells are put in standby mode after the mutated protein response attacks the CNS. So I thought what if a specific frequency could activate the opposite response. An IL 17 oligodendrocyte activation through lipid protein intake mixed with specific electro stimulation therapy to reduce these flair ups causing restless leg syndrome. Well after some experimentation it worked in less than eight minutes without pramipexole! I'm so happy for her she is sleeping like a baby right now. Here is how we did it, I plan on refining the process but we used softened beans as a protein source and vitamin d as a lipid source and placed it under the tongue for a quicker mandibular cytokines reaction. We then placed electrodes on her legs just above the ankles and set the pulse width to 140 microseconds and the pulse rate to 50 hertz on her TENS unit. The severity may differ for others and adjustment may be needed, but then I punctured the surface area of the skin on each calf muscle with a sterilized needle to speed up factor protein binding reaction... low and behold it was not three minutes later her dead leg and feet feeling disappeared. We have been in a relationship for almost two years now and this is the first time since her flair ups began that we have not been up all night tossing and turning trying to manage the RLS. This was an amazing step forward into relieving her pain and suffering and I believe it may help others so I'm writing it down. Like I said if it helps one other person it will be worth it. 	1	1	A|tip|for|restless|leg|syndrome|and|demyelination|of|relapse|remit|,|how|to|possibly|get|sleep|when|the|microglial|inflammation|occurs|.

My father died at the age of 52 and at the age of 25 (almost 28 now) I was put on cholesterol medication because of elevated levels as a preventative measure. Rewind to Tuesday, I was at work and I had this sudden stabbing pain in my left arm and I went back to my desk and nearly fainted. I brushed this off and chopped it up to a weird thing in my body. Later that evening, around 9 p.m., as prepping for a bakesale and all of the tins fell out of my left hand while I was putting them in the baking sheet. My left leg started to give out and I called my friend to bring me to emergency. While waiting for him I walked back and forth because I felt woozy again. En route, I had bad chest pains and felt like I could pass out at any moment. When at the hospital I got my EKG done and then 7 hours later a heart ultrasound. Got dismissed and chopped it up to side effects of a medication I've been taking for 3 years. I took their word for it. Then, on Thursday, things got worse. I was at work again and just felt something come on because I was looking at my screen and forgot how to save a document. Then my vision went blurry and my tongue felt like it was swollen to the size of my mouth. I work in a French environment, so when I went to talk to my colleagues I felt like I was swallowing my words and was incoherent. One drove me to the hospital emergency again and I was frightened. My heart rate was 150 and I thought I was having a stroke because my whole left side, again, was numb. I was registering with triage in a panic and still, like the other night, had an excruciating wait. I ended up leaving and taking an appointment with my GP who has a walk-in. When I left the hospital the cold air hit my face and I could only feel the right side. At the walk-in clinic the doctor that was present listened to my symptoms and said that there needs to be a chain event of neurological events that relate Multiple Sclerosis. He theorized aneurysm but I would have presented much differently. And when he said that I felt like it was so unusual to hear that, but my friend recently got diagnosed with MS and another a few years ago. Anyways, here I am two days later with numbness still down my left side. Every evening around 9:30 I feel awful and nauseous and have an extreme mental fog. It's going to be a while to figure things out, but I have been presenting symptoms for a while. And recently, in July, I had what appeared to be trigeminal neuralgia but my dentist said it was a tooth ache; which I have never had in my life. I am frightened, and just confused as to what is going on with me. Just wanted to reach out to you guys as I embark on this journey to find out what is going on. I have an appointment on Tuesday with my psychiatrist (bipolar type I) and then with my GP on the 25th. Hope to get the ball rolling... I have been reading through a lot of this and I just wanted to extend my heart and courage to you guys and what you're experiencing. Thanks for reading. 	1	0	A|Scary|Week	Hi|folks|.|First|time|tuning|into|this|community|,|because|,|honestly|,|this|week|was|the|first|time|I've|considered|the|symptoms|and|information|related|to|MS|.|The|reason|this|happened|is|because|of|two|scary|events|this|week|.|My|family|has|a|history|of|heart|disease|and|stroke|.|My|father|died|at|the|age|of|52|and|at|the|age|of|25|(|almost|28|now|)|I|was|put|on|cholesterol|medication|because|of|elevated|levels|as|a|preventative|measure|.|Rewind|to|Tuesday|,|I|was|at|work|and|I|had|this|sudden|stabbing|pain|in|my|left|arm|and|I|went|back|to|my|desk|and|nearly|fainted|.|I|brushed|this|off|and|chopped|it|up|to|a|weird|thing|in|my|body|.|Later|that|evening|,|around|9|p|.|m|.|,|as|prepping|for|a|bakesale|and|all|of|the|tins|fell|out|of|my|left|hand|while|I|was|putting|them|in|the|baking|sheet|.|My|left|leg|started|to|give|out|and|I|called|my|friend|to|bring|me|to|emergency|.|While|waiting|for|him|I|walked|back|and|forth|because|I|felt|woozy|again|.|En|route|,|I|had|bad|chest|pains|and|felt|like|I|could|pass|out|at|any|moment|.|When|at|the|hospital|I|got|my|EKG|done|and|then|7|hours|later|a|heart|ultrasound|.|Got|dismissed|and|chopped|it|up|to|side|effects|of|a|medication|I've|been|taking|for|3|years|.|I|took|their|word|for|it|.|Then|,|on|Thursday|,|things|got|worse|.|I|was|at|work|again|and|just|felt|something|come|on|because|I|was|looking|at|my|screen|and|forgot|how|to|save|a|document|.|Then|my|vision|went|blurry|and|my|tongue|felt|like|it|was|swollen|to|the|size|of|my|mouth|.|I|work|in|a|French|environment|,|so|when|I|went|to|talk|to|my|colleagues|I|felt|like|I|was|swallowing|my|words|and|was|incoherent|.|One|drove|me|to|the|hospital|emergency|again|and|I|was|frightened|.|My|heart|rate|was|150|and|I|thought|I|was|having|a|stroke|because|my|whole|left|side|,|again|,|was|numb|.|I|was|registering|with|triage|in|a|panic|and|still|,|like|the|other|night|,|had|an|excruciating|wait|.|I|ended|up|leaving|and|taking|an|appointment|with|my|GP|who|has|a|walk-in|.|When|I|left|the|hospital|the|cold|air|hit|my|face|and|I|could|only|feel|the|right|side|.|At|the|walk-in|clinic|the|doctor|that|was|present|listened|to|my|symptoms|and|said|that|there|needs|to|be|a|chain|event|of|neurological|events|that|relate|Multiple|Sclerosis|.|He|theorized|aneurysm|but|I|would|have|presented|much|differently|.|And|when|he|said|that|I|felt|like|it|was|so|unusual|to|hear|that|,|but|my|friend|recently|got|diagnosed|with|MS|and|another|a|few|years|ago|.|Anyways|,|here|I|am|two|days|later|with|numbness|still|down|my|left|side|.|Every|evening|around|9:30|I|feel|awful|and|nauseous|and|have|an|extreme|mental|fog|.|It's|going|to|be|a|while|to|figure|things|out|,|but|I|have|been|presenting|symptoms|for|a|while|.|And|recently|,|in|July|,|I|had|what|appeared|to|be|trigeminal|neuralgia|but|my|dentist|said|it|was|a|tooth|ache|;|which|I|have|never|had|in|my|life|.|I|am|frightened|,|and|just|confused|as|to|what|is|going|on|with|me|.|Just|wanted|to|reach|out|to|you|guys|as|I|embark|on|this|journey|to|find|out|what|is|going|on|.|I|have|an|appointment|on|Tuesday|with|my|psychiatrist|(|bipolar|type|I|)|and|then|with|my|GP|on|the|25th|.|Hope|to|get|the|ball|rolling|...|I|have|been|reading|through|a|lot|of|this|and|I|just|wanted|to|extend|my|heart|and|courage|to|you|guys|and|what|you're|experiencing|.|Thanks|for|reading|.

I've always struggled with fatigue/hemiplegic migraines/vertigo my whole life (19f) and was recently diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. I'm supposed to see a geneticist in like five months about it. I had an MRI of my brain 6 months ago for a different reason and it seemed to have checked out perfectly, so we ruled out MS. My doc wants me to re-do it. The past 20ish days i've been experiencing stiffness, i wake up in pain, i'm constantly nauseous and my cognitive function has declined. I have vision issues now and lose my balance more often. She said it could be rheumatoid, it could be MS, or it could be my EDS. She told me all of those diseases really intertwine when it comes to symptoms and it's difficult to detect which ones until you have very specific tests. I guess the reason i'm here is because i was wondering if anyone got a misdiagnosis? I have a hard time believing we would've missed MS on my MRI from the summer, but i have regressed fast and she told me MS is usually diagnosed in your early 20s-mid 40s and i'm a bit nervous. 	1	0	How|common|is|missing|MS|on|an|MRI|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4708061707311798553/Tysabri-vs.-Ocrevus	Tysabri vs. Ocrevus	So, I had my first neurologist appointment this past Tuesday. He cleared up a lot of things for me, like how many lesions I have on my brain (5-6), how many on my spinal cord (3, including one on the pons), and where most of my symptoms were coming from which was a giant lesion on my left spinal cord. It's RRMS, which in a way is comforting to know. I then proceeded to go have 11 vials of blood drawn to determine if I have that antibody that makes the potential brain disease from tysabri much more likely than it would be otherwise, after a sleepless night. He prescribed me a children's bedwetting med to help with that and, you know, the bedwetting LOL. It was a good experience overall but I'm concerned about choosing between these two medicines. Between a fatal brain disease for tysabri and potential breast cancer with ovrevus (or so my mother has told me after her perusing of the internet)... It's a tough choice to make. Hopefully the blood test will help my decision along. I am leaning towards tysabri, but then another concern is that I read its effectiveness can lessen after two years of use and the potential for contracting that aforementioned brain disease increases. Is this true? I don't know. My doctor told me it was 1 in 10,000 I would get it if I don't have the antibody. But hey, I have MS and that's a pretty narrow chance too. What's your experience with your meds?

My anxiety is heightening these symptoms of course and Google is NOT MY FRIEND. Today the numbness was in both arms and I was shaking. Shooting pain in the right side of my neck. I promptly had a meltdown and went to the ER. Vitals/ blood is normal, fever of 100. ER doctor says that MRI's in the ER are for stroke patients/ er emergencies. Called my primary and she ordered an MRI and I'll schedule that immediately. I've had esophageal dysphagia for about 10 years with no known cause (saw this mentioned in a thread) Reading thru this sub has made me accept that it is likely I have MS. That is ok.

I was diagnosed 4 years ago at the age of 16 but I had undiagnosed symptoms for many years; the doctors believe my onset could have been as early as age 5. My question is: has anyone had any issues with swallowing? For as long as I can remember, I hold a sip of drink in my mouth for a couple of seconds before swallowing.

Migraine was most common correct diagnosis eventually given these people. The retrospective study “Incidence of multiple sclerosis misdiagnosis in referrals to two academic centers” was published in the journal Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders. No single test can directly identify MS, and a diagnosis can be difficult. To rule out MS-mimicking conditions during clinical assessments, physicians perform a set of evaluations that include lab tests, a patient's medical history, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. To better establish clinical recommendations, speed-up diagnosis, and avoid misdiagnosis, an international panel established the McDonald criteria for MS in 2001 in association with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The panel further revised the criteria in 2005, 2010, and 2017. But misdiagnosis can still be prevalent, raising a risk of improper treatment for the person and needlessly higher healthcare costs to the society. A clinical team at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles performed a retrospective (backward-looking) study, investigating the rates and types of MS misdiagnoses at two local MS-specialized centers. Out of 364 patients evaluated for MS at Cedars-Sinai and at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), 241 were referred for treatment between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017. Results showed that 19 (17%) of these patients at Cedars-Sinai and 24 (19%) at UCLA had been misdiagnosed. These people spent an average of four years under specialized MS care before being correctly diagnosed, with one wrongly treated for MS for 20 years. Most of these patients showed clinical symptoms uncharacteristic for MS, including headache — 74% in Cedars-Sinai group, and 67% in UCLA group. Most were given an MS diagnosis after an MRI or a cerebrospinal fluid assessment. The most common correct diagnoses finally given were migraine (16%), radiologically isolated syndrome (9%), spondylopathy (7%; a disorder affecting the vertebrae), and neuropathy (7%; a disorder affecting peripheral nerves). Researchers then analyzed the types of treatment used by misdiagnosed patients. They found that 72 percent had been prescribed disease-modifying MS treatments, with 48 percent of patients receiving therapies with a known risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a serious viral brain infection. About $10 million was the estimated cost to U.S. healthcare system due to the unnecessary use of MS disease-modifying treatments. “In our combined cohort, almost 1 in 5 patients who carried an established diagnosis of MS did not fulfill contemporary McDonald Criteria and had a more likely alternate diagnosis,” the researchers wrote. “Misdiagnosis appeared to be associated with misapplication of MS diagnostic criteria, specifically overreliance on – or misinterpretation of – radiographic findings in patients with syndromes atypical for MS,” they added. Given these findings, the team emphasized the need for MS-specific biomarkers to help more accurately diagnose MS. 	1	0	Almost|1|in|5|People|Wrongly|Diagnosed|with|MS|at|Two|Specialized|Centers|in|US|,|Study|Finds	https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2019/02/13/almost-1-in-5-people-wrongly-diagnosed-with-ms-at-two-specialized-centers-in-us-study-finds/|Almost|1|in|5|People|Wrongly|Diagnosed|with|MS|at|Two|Specialized|Centers|in|US|,|Study|Finds|FEBRUARY|13|,|2019|by|Santiago|Gisler|Almost|1|in|5|People|Wrongly|Diagnosed|with|MS|at|Two|Specialized|Centers|in|US|,|Study|Finds|Almost|one|in|five|patients|diagnosed|with|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|and|referred|to|one|of|two|MS-specialized|centers|in|the|U|.|S|.|were|found|to|not|have|the|disease|,|a|study|at|those|two|centers|reported|.|Migraine|was|most|common|correct|diagnosis|eventually|given|these|people|.|The|retrospective|study|“|Incidence|of|multiple|sclerosis|misdiagnosis|in|referrals|to|two|academic|centers|”|was|published|in|the|journal|Multiple|Sclerosis|and|Related|Disorders|.|No|single|test|can|directly|identify|MS|,|and|a|diagnosis|can|be|difficult|.|To|rule|out|MS-mimicking|conditions|during|clinical|assessments|,|physicians|perform|a|set|of|evaluations|that|include|lab|tests|,|a|patient's|medical|history|,|and|magnetic|resonance|imaging|(|MRI|)|scans|of|the|brain|.|To|better|establish|clinical|recommendations|,|speed-up|diagnosis|,|and|avoid|misdiagnosis|,|an|international|panel|established|the|McDonald|criteria|for|MS|in|2001|in|association|with|the|National|Multiple|Sclerosis|Society|.|The|panel|further|revised|the|criteria|in|2005|,|2010|,|and|2017|.|But|misdiagnosis|can|still|be|prevalent|,|raising|a|risk|of|improper|treatment|for|the|person|and|needlessly|higher|healthcare|costs|to|the|society|.|A|clinical|team|at|the|Cedars-Sinai|Medical|Center|in|Los|Angeles|performed|a|retrospective|(|backward-looking|)|study|,|investigating|the|rates|and|types|of|MS|misdiagnoses|at|two|local|MS-specialized|centers|.|Out|of|364|patients|evaluated|for|MS|at|Cedars-Sinai|and|at|the|University|of|California|,|Los|Angeles|(|UCLA|)|,|241|were|referred|for|treatment|between|July|1|,|2016|,|and|June|30|,|2017|.|Results|showed|that|19|(|17|%|)|of|these|patients|at|Cedars-Sinai|and|24|(|19|%|)|at|UCLA|had|been|misdiagnosed|.|These|people|spent|an|average|of|four|years|under|specialized|MS|care|before|being|correctly|diagnosed|,|with|one|wrongly|treated|for|MS|for|20|years|.|Most|of|these|patients|showed|clinical|symptoms|uncharacteristic|for|MS|,|including|headache|—|74|%|in|Cedars-Sinai|group|,|and|67|%|in|UCLA|group|.|Most|were|given|an|MS|diagnosis|after|an|MRI|or|a|cerebrospinal|fluid|assessment|.|The|most|common|correct|diagnoses|finally|given|were|migraine|(|16|%|)|,|radiologically|isolated|syndrome|(|9|%|)|,|spondylopathy|(|7|%|;|a|disorder|affecting|the|vertebrae|)|,|and|neuropathy|(|7|%|;|a|disorder|affecting|peripheral|nerves|)|.|Researchers|then|analyzed|the|types|of|treatment|used|by|misdiagnosed|patients|.|They|found|that|72|percent|had|been|prescribed|disease-modifying|MS|treatments|,|with|48|percent|of|patients|receiving|therapies|with|a|known|risk|of|progressive|multifocal|leukoencephalopathy|,|a|serious|viral|brain|infection|.|About|$|10|million|was|the|estimated|cost|to|U|.|S|.|healthcare|system|due|to|the|unnecessary|use|of|MS|disease-modifying|treatments|.|“|In|our|combined|cohort|,|almost|1|in|5|patients|who|carried|an|established|diagnosis|of|MS|did|not|fulfill|contemporary|McDonald|Criteria|and|had|a|more|likely|alternate|diagnosis|,|”|the|researchers|wrote|.|“|Misdiagnosis|appeared|to|be|associated|with|misapplication|of|MS|diagnostic|criteria|,|specifically|overreliance|on|–|or|misinterpretation|of|–|radiographic|findings|in|patients|with|syndromes|atypical|for|MS|,|”|they|added|.|Given|these|findings|,|the|team|emphasized|the|need|for|MS-specific|biomarkers|to|help|more|accurately|diagnose|MS|.

Ill keep this short and sweet. My (19F) mother (~59F) suffers from MS, and has been suffering for years now with the disease after years of assisting my father with his currently still ongoing cancer. Bluntly put, she can be a bit... abrasive at times. To be more specific, she constantly blames me for her monetary issues, takes out her anger and pain on me and my father by screaming at us whenever she's not having a good day, and tends to gaslight me and my issues whenever I vent them to her. My father is clearly upset by how she's been treating us, but whenever I ask him about it he just says ""oh it's because of her disease"". Does MS actually just turn you into a bitch? Or is she just using it as a crutch and excuse for her verbally abusive behaviors? Should I be a little more understanding if this is simply a result of her MS? For reference she is currently on mediciation, though of what sort I am unaware and ""not allowed"" to know, though my folks are super low income, so she's often untreated when she suffers from relapses.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4707353939257589637/Just-diagnosed	Just diagnosed	Hi all, First time poster (hope it's cool to start a new thread) Aussie, 37yr Male. Thought I'd share my exp. Had my MRI this past Saturday and my Neurologist today diagnosed me with MS. I'm pretty down.... The last 1week I've been having double vision and last 6months had right leg issues. I thought it was a displaced disc, obviously not. Tomorrow I begin my steroids to assist with my vision. My neurologist has recommended the drug Ocrevus which after some blood tests I should commence in a fortnight. Ive been reflecting last 24 hrs and I now realise I've been having relapses last 10 years here and there... 3 yrs ago I had double vision, last 10yrs if I move my chin to my chest I can feel the nerves in my spine and difficulty in running last 5years. As I said I felt pretty down seeing all the white spots on my MRI, but, also a sense of relief. Finally I now know the reason why. And thus begins my journey to combat this virus. I'd love to hear advice for newly diagnosed MS peeps... I'm positive, have to be, I'm not going to let this slippery little SOB take me down... Not easily.. Thanks for reading/listening fellow Redditors. Good luck on your journey. *Edit: Wow, thank you all for your response. Waking up here downunder and seeing all your posts has certainly made my morning. I will attempt to answer each individually.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4707235952638945256/When-the-MS-bomb-got-dropped	When the MS bomb got dropped	“We both know what this is Nadine. If it looks like MS and smells like MS... it is more than likely MS. Now all we need to do is play the waiting game to confirm it.” These are words that I will never forget. This was about 3 or 4 days after I was in denial about seeing double of everything and couldn't see anything wrong with my eyes in the mirror. I went to work on the 9th Feb 2018 and promised myself that I would go to A&E after work. However, when Camilo came into the office and I looked at him, he calmly said ‘umm Nadine I think you need to go to A&E now and not later'. As soon as it dawned on me that there was actually something wrong and that I was not imagining it, the tears began to fall. Already finding it difficult to make my way across London to Moorfields eye hospital with double vision/ a wonky eye and a banging headache, the tears were not helping. When I started putting the puzzle pieces together with all the little difficulties I had had over the last year I immediately thought Multiple sclerosis. I kept just thinking that I was being a paranoid person who was overthinking the things we were taught as Speech Therapist's. Walking into A&E and telling them my symptoms as well as the fact my mother has Multiple Sclerosis made them escalate the issue and very shortly after, I got to see the consultant who ‘subtly' dropped the ‘MS' bomb. It has been an absolute whirlwind ‘adventure' since then and I feel the last year has gone far too quickly for me to actually process. Of course my family were very supportive and I easily brushed it all off and put on a brave face. What people are not aware of is what went on behind closed doors. This whole diagnosis was a a complete knock to whatever confidence I had. I would drown myself in research and listen to every podcast under the sun. I tried to pretend everything in my day to day life was just as it was. It was Dave who made the positive step forward in picking up my broken pieces. He initiated small changes to help with the bigger picture which truly helped me more than anything else. Who knew that only a few months after being engaged, Dave was already proving to me that he will love me during sickness and in health. 2018 was truly a year that I hated but loved almost equally. 2018 was the year that I felt like I hit rock bottom mentally but at the same time it was the year I got back up. I made sure that I appreciated the abilities I do have and push myself as far as I can go both physically and mentally.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4707059028518017554/MS-and-Heat-mymsteam.com	MS and Heat (mymsteam.com)	Uhthoff's phenomenon (also known as Uhthoff's syndrome, Uhthoff's sign, and Uhthoff's symptom) is the worsening of neurologic symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurological, demyelinating conditions when the body gets overheated from hot weather, exercise, fever, or saunas and hot tubs. Many people with MS experience a temporary worsening of their symptoms when the weather is very hot or humid, or when they run a fever. These temporary changes can result from even a slight elevation in core body temperature (one-quarter to one-half of a degree). An elevated temperature further impairs the ability of a demyelinated nerve to conduct electrical impulses. Activities including sunbathing, exercise, and taking very hot showers or baths can have the same effect. For example, some people notice their vision becomes blurred when they get overheated — a phenomenon known as Uhthoff's sign. Heat-related symptoms are temporary Heat generally produces only temporary worsening of symptoms. It does not cause more disease activity (demyelination or damage to the nerves themselves). The symptoms generally reverse quickly when the source of increased temperature is removed. Strategies for easing the effects of heat • Stay in an air-conditioned environment during periods of extreme heat and humidity. If an air conditioner is needed to help minimize symptoms, the cost of this equipment may be tax deductible if the physician has written a prescription for it. • Use cooling products such as vests, neck wraps, and bandana during exercise or outdoor activity. • Wear lightweight, loose, breathable clothing. • Icy drinks or popsicles can provide temporary relief. • Use an oscillating fan or air conditioning during indoor exercise. • Exercise in a cool pool (<85 degrees) or a cool environment. If you are exercising outside, pick cooler times of the day, usually early morning or evening. • Try pre- and post-cooling to decrease the heating effects of exercise. Get into a bathtub of cool water and continue adding cooler water over a period of 20 to 30 minutes. A cool bath or shower can also help reduce core body temperature following activity or exposure to a hot environment. 	1	0	MS|and|Heat|(|mymsteam.com|)	Uhthoff's|phenomenon|(|also|known|as|Uhthoff's|syndrome|,|Uhthoff's|sign|,|and|Uhthoff's|symptom|)|is|the|worsening|of|neurologic|symptoms|in|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|and|other|neurological|,|demyelinating|conditions|when|the|body|gets|overheated|from|hot|weather|,|exercise|,|fever|,|or|saunas|and|hot|tubs|.|Many|people|with|MS|experience|a|temporary|worsening|of|their|symptoms|when|the|weather|is|very|hot|or|humid|,|or|when|they|run|a|fever|.|These|temporary|changes|can|result|from|even|a|slight|elevation|in|core|body|temperature|(|one-quarter|to|one-half|of|a|degree|)|.|An|elevated|temperature|further|impairs|the|ability|of|a|demyelinated|nerve|to|conduct|electrical|impulses|.|Activities|including|sunbathing|,|exercise|,|and|taking|very|hot|showers|or|baths|can|have|the|same|effect|.|For|example|,|some|people|notice|their|vision|becomes|blurred|when|they|get|overheated|—|a|phenomenon|known|as|Uhthoff's|sign|.|Heat-related|symptoms|are|temporary|Heat|generally|produces|only|temporary|worsening|of|symptoms|.|It|does|not|cause|more|disease|activity|(|demyelination|or|damage|to|the|nerves|themselves|)|.|The|symptoms|generally|reverse|quickly|when|the|source|of|increased|temperature|is|removed|.|Strategies|for|easing|the|effects|of|heat|•|Stay|in|an|air-conditioned|environment|during|periods|of|extreme|heat|and|humidity|.|If|an|air|conditioner|is|needed|to|help|minimize|symptoms|,|the|cost|of|this|equipment|may|be|tax|deductible|if|the|physician|has|written|a|prescription|for|it|.|•|Use|cooling|products|such|as|vests|,|neck|wraps|,|and|bandana|during|exercise|or|outdoor|activity|.|•|Wear|lightweight|,|loose|,|breathable|clothing|.|•|Icy|drinks|or|popsicles|can|provide|temporary|relief|.|•|Use|an|oscillating|fan|or|air|conditioning|during|indoor|exercise|.|•|Exercise|in|a|cool|pool|(|<|85|degrees|)|or|a|cool|environment|.|If|you|are|exercising|outside|,|pick|cooler|times|of|the|day|,|usually|early|morning|or|evening|.|•|Try|pre|-|and|post-cooling|to|decrease|the|heating|effects|of|exercise|.|Get|into|a|bathtub|of|cool|water|and|continue|adding|cooler|water|over|a|period|of|20|to|30|minutes|.|A|cool|bath|or|shower|can|also|help|reduce|core|body|temperature|following|activity|or|exposure|to|a|hot|environment|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4707059028519531422/Nervous-about-an-MRI-tomorrow.	Nervous about an MRI tomorrow.	Hello all y'all beautiful people. I first started having symptoms (fatigue, muscle spasms, tingling, etc.) around 4 or so years ago when I was 21. It was manageable and since I was both depressed and working a pretty physical job at the time my doctor and I agreed it was probably just physical and mental stress. Regardless he ran some blood work (which came back fine) and referred me to a neurologist. I saw the neurologist once who advised me to come back if things got worse. Over the following years it sort of waxed and waned and I mostly got used to it and/or convinced myself that it was just in my head. Last spring things got bad again pretty quickly. I was tired to the point of sleeping 14 hours a day, patches on my left leg that always felt wet, an arm that perpetually felt like someone had just hit my funny bone, and vertigo. I saw my neurologist as soon as possible and had cervical and cranial MRIs done. Spine came back fine, brain came back with over a dozen hyper-intensities. Due to the MRI and my history my neurologist informed me that MS was a very real possibility, but he was hesitant to diagnose me without having further evidence. So he gave me the option of either choosing a lumbar puncture or a follow-up set of MRIs in 6 months. I chose the latter as I was starting to feel better again, (and was scared of receiving a diagnosis lol). Needless to say tomorrow is the big scary date. The past 6 months have been relatively ok despite pretty consistent nerve pain, muscle twitches, some cognitive issues, and a few scary periods of pain in my right eye accompanied by blurry vision. I think it's just starting to sink in that within a week or two I'll probably receive some kind of information that will likely hugely impact my future one way or another. I'm not sure why I'm posting. I know you aren't supposed to provide any kind of diagnostic info and I'm not looking for it either. This is probably just one long winded rant to help settle my nerves and get a little something off my chest. If you made it this far thank ya for reading, and I hope you have a fantastic day! 	1	0	Nervous|about|an|MRI|tomorrow|.

Right, it's all biology isn't it, so even though it's the one thing that makes me feel awkward to discuss, I'll be a grown-up for a bit.   DX'd June last year, quite active RRMS but caught nice and early and by-no-means debilitating. Had Lemtrada/Alemtuzumab round 1 a few weeks back and all is going well.   Aside from the common side-effects and my usual symptoms flaring a bit (which isn't relevant for this post), I've been having some real issues with my digestive system.   Now, I've had some issues for quite a while now but always put them down to a very high-fibre diet and a lot of natural peanut butter (50g a day, on average). It started out just as bad gas and intestinal bloating (the latter presumably because I'm in the office a lot... and have to keep a lid on it obviously!).   The gas got horrendous, to the point where even my own smirking enthusiasm started shifting towards concern. I thought it might be Huel shakes (my lunch choice, most of the time) from all the additional fibre... so I stopped them - but no change.   I'm going to start eliminating things one by one (I eat a fairly repetitive diet - as long as it's healthy and meets my macro requirements, I don't care) and might do one of those intolerance tests, but has anyone else experienced this with MS?   cheers! 	1	1	Let's|talk|bowels|.

I had not looked up who was coming I just had faith. The best part was the guy was disabled and made fun of himself the entire act. It was hysterical!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4706233250544196709/Tysabri-infusion-day-is-harder-emotionally-than-physically.	Tysabri infusion day is harder emotionally than physically.	I've had a few Tysabri infusions now. No side effects at all, no brand new symptoms, and it's about US$30 a YEAR in cost - plus free neuro visits and MRIs. Everyone is really nice. My numb hand is slowly receding after 7 months. I'm very lucky. But I don't feel it on infusion day. I'm starting to dislike going not because of the process - but because of what I see there. The stark reality of possible futures. My infusions are done in a room with 4-5 other people also getting Tysabri, and it's different people each time. I'm in my early 30s and have only been diagnosed for a few months. But I'm seeing people older than me (some not by much) who are heavily impacted by the disease. Wheelchairs, mobility devices, shaking limbs. I don't want to cause offense - they're just ordinary folks doing exactly what I'm doing and for the same reason. Lots of you here have probably progressed further than me. I'm wary about posting this for that reason. But finding yourself in a position where you can see possible roads that you could go down which scare the crap out of you once a month... that is a really disconcerting place to suddenly be in your life, right? (I'll probably get used to it. I'm still deeply torn about whether to step away from my extremely full-on job and try doing some actual living or not, and I think seeing this stuff is affecting my decision making. But I'd love to hear from anyone who walks into their infusion center with some personal fears.). 	1	1	Tysabri|infusion|day|is|harder|emotionally|than|physically|.

This sub has been a great resource for info and encouragement. I searched through a lot of posts and comments here and was as prepared as possible for today. Not sure if I'd be sleepy or bored so I had everything, a Switch, iPad, snacks, etc. I know it is a wide range of experiences for everyone, but as of this moment, mine was a smooth as I could imagine. Thank you to anyone who suggested Jolly Ranchers. I didn't get any metallic taste at all. My only reactions were a brief period where I was lightheaded and my blood pressure went up a little. Both were on their way back to normal by the time I was able to head home. The whole process took me almost exactly 4 1/2 hours. So thank you all!!!

The other MRI showed mild plaque on the brain... but see.. I realized these techs who dictate the MRI findings... Don't necessarily know and the doc goes by their findings!! Why is it so hard to find a doc to dx ? I truly believe I go into remission. I can't do steroid injections. They cause excruitisting pain more so. Docs think I'm crazy send me to cognitive therapy ..

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705879357790015480/Gabapentin-wondering	Gabapentin wondering	If you remember me, I posted recently about how I was worried about my first neurologist appointment. It went went, neruo isn't sure I will end up with a MS diagnosis, isn't sure my symptoms are severe enough, but ordered an MRI, an EEG, and a neuro psych battery. The fact that my symptoms come and go consistently + my mother having MS made him want me to get further testing, as opposed to attributing all um symptoms to other diagnoses I have. My symptoms include congnitive issues, pins and needles, and general body pain. I also have a diagnosis of fibromyalgia and a panic Disorder. So doc started me on gabapentin, and so far I'm noticing a difference in my pins and needles, which is AMAZING. That's honestly my worst symptom, I fucking hate it. it's not gone completely, but it's not as bad and doesn't linger as long. I wanted to reach out about a few things though 1) I'm supposed to take 1 300mg pill 3 times a day (once I've built up). my schedule is Fucked. one day I'll wake up at 10 for class, next day I'm up til 2am for a show, etc. Right now I'm thinking of instead of say, taking one at breakfast, one at noon, and one before bed, setting a 7ish hour timer on my phone. To me that seems like the best way to keep my dose consistent. does anyone else space their medicine this way? 2) I'm definitely noticing a spike in my anxiety. generally I'm down to 2 panic attacks a week, but I've already had 2 in the 4ish days since I've started. was wondering if anyone else experienced a spike in anxiety, and how they dealt with it 3) I'm having some stomach pain, nothing crazy, a little nausea and some cramping. it honestly might be from the anxiety spike: whenever I'm consistently badly anxious like this I get a lot of acid reflux. basically looking for anyone who has had a similar experience, and maybe some encouragement bc the anxiety is Rough right now. 	1	0	Gabapentin|wondering	If|you|remember|me|,|I|posted|recently|about|how|I|was|worried|about|my|first|neurologist|appointment|.|It|went|went|,|neruo|isn't|sure|I|will|end|up|with|a|MS|diagnosis|,|isn't|sure|my|symptoms|are|severe|enough|,|but|ordered|an|MRI|,|an|EEG|,|and|a|neuro|psych|battery|.|The|fact|that|my|symptoms|come|and|go|consistently|+|my|mother|having|MS|made|him|want|me|to|get|further|testing|,|as|opposed|to|attributing|all|um|symptoms|to|other|diagnoses|I|have|.|My|symptoms|include|congnitive|issues|,|pins|and|needles|,|and|general|body|pain|.|I|also|have|a|diagnosis|of|fibromyalgia|and|a|panic|Disorder|.|So|doc|started|me|on|gabapentin|,|and|so|far|I'm|noticing|a|difference|in|my|pins|and|needles|,|which|is|AMAZING|.|That's|honestly|my|worst|symptom|,|I|fucking|hate|it|.|it's|not|gone|completely|,|but|it's|not|as|bad|and|doesn't|linger|as|long|.|I|wanted|to|reach|out|about|a|few|things|though|1|)|I'm|supposed|to|take|1|300mg|pill|3|times|a|day|(|once|I've|built|up|)|.|my|schedule|is|Fucked|.|one|day|I'll|wake|up|at|10|for|class|,|next|day|I'm|up|til|2am|for|a|show|,|etc|.|Right|now|I'm|thinking|of|instead|of|say|,|taking|one|at|breakfast|,|one|at|noon|,|and|one|before|bed|,|setting|a|7ish|hour|timer|on|my|phone|.|To|me|that|seems|like|the|best|way|to|keep|my|dose|consistent|.|does|anyone|else|space|their|medicine|this|way|?|2|)|I'm|definitely|noticing|a|spike|in|my|anxiety|.|generally|I'm|down|to|2|panic|attacks|a|week|,|but|I've|already|had|2|in|the|4ish|days|since|I've|started|.|was|wondering|if|anyone|else|experienced|a|spike|in|anxiety|,|and|how|they|dealt|with|it|3|)|I'm|having|some|stomach|pain|,|nothing|crazy|,|a|little|nausea|and|some|cramping|.|it|honestly|might|be|from|the|anxiety|spike|:|whenever|I'm|consistently|badly|anxious|like|this|I|get|a|lot|of|acid|reflux|.|basically|looking|for|anyone|who|has|had|a|similar|experience|,|and|maybe|some|encouragement|bc|the|anxiety|is|Rough|right|now|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705702409952435467/Do-lesions-show-up-even-when-symptoms-are-minor?	Do lesions show up even when symptoms are minor?	"TL; DR: Do lesions show up on MRI even if you're in remission? Okay, sorry about the block of text incoming. Let's go back to 2015 *insert fun time lapse here*. I injured my hip at the gym and ended up going to the ER because I couldn't walk. They told me nothing was wrong, told me to max out on ibuprofen, and sent me on my way. Fast forward 1.5/2 years forward and my feet are swollen and I can barely walk (also noteworthy that at that time I was 20 years old). A bunch of doctors from campus medical center tell me that that's normal. Eventually I see my PCP who is like ""Looks like RA if I ever saw it"". Order blood labs, looks like she's right: seropositive RA. I get into a rheumatologist, we start with some Prednisone and pretty quickly add methotrexate and Enbrel. Enbrel makes one side of my body go completely numb, but I was kind of a dipshit, so I assumed it was normal and said nothing. 3 months of Enbrel do nothing, so we switch to Humira, which makes my hands go numb and does literally nothing for my swelling. Started vomiting up the Prednisone, so tapered off of it. Big flare in March, end up taking some Prednisone and it gives me insta-anxiety. Also was super itchy before and after the Prednisone, which campus doctors told me was anxiety (which I have, but never like that). They give me some hydroxyzine and send me on my way. I switch rheumatologists because the Prednisone episode freaked me out. Get a Remicade infusion that does nothing. The university therapist kicks me out of therapy because I've apparently been there too long (10 weeks? or 12?). Get another Remicade infusion that gives me the throat swellies and irritates my liver. So we switch back to Enbrel which does the numbing thing again, then we switch to Actemra and it does the throat swellies too. We try Xeljanz and it gave me migraines and nausea and foot pain so bad I couldn't stand up. So, we switched to Orencia which has been incredible up to this point because it's starting to not work great. At some point, I got irritated by bladder issues with no explanation and send a list to my rheumatologist of all the symptoms I'd been having that university doctors and urgent care doctors had been ignoring. I saw the neurologist and she suspects MS. I have an MRI in a week (took insurance 3 months to approve it), but most of my symptoms have either dissipated, or aren't as severe (psychologic symptoms being managed by buspirone and mirtazapine). I'm having some difficulty swallowing and thinking and my bladder is spasming a little and naturally my eye is twitching (I don't drink caffeine, usually get enough sleep, avoid screens and am not currently under too much stress, so that eliminates those as potential factors for the eye twitch). If there are lesions, will they show up even if symptoms have lessened/remitted? Also, how long do MRIs with contrast last in your experience? (These will be of my brain and cervical spine).

In your experience, were intermittent one-sided facial numbness and/or leg weakness/sensitivity symptoms that led to your diagnosis?	"I (23f) have always dealt with somewhat weak feeling legs. I can only stand for a few mins without my legs killing me, and when I walk, they feel weak, as if there are cinder blocks attached to them a lot of times. That's the symptom I can remember having the longest, but I always thought maybe it was in my head or something. Now I experience much more bothersome symptoms of SOMETHING but I don't know what exactly. One of my biggest irritations is about once or twice a month, I wake up to a completely numb lower right half of my face, including the right side of my mouth/lips. Not like a leg or arm falling asleep from being in the wrong position, but just completely numb. Could stick a needle through it and not feel anything. Additionally, last year for about 3 months my left leg was tingling/numb CONSTANTLY without relief, ever. Always on the verge of the ""falling asleep"" feeling; it was torture and there were many days I could not bear to sit at my work desk or deal with it at all. It got better, but I now experience a burning/tingling sensation in my knees, as well as frequent tingling and numbness in my fingers, specifically my pinkies and a bit further up my wrists. I've also suddenly become hypersensitive to certain textures touching my legs; can't wear certain pants or use certain blankets anymore without irritation. In addition to all this, if I even walk *down* a couple flights of stairs, my legs are noodles and will be sore for many days afterward. My PCP seemed very shocked by this (first visit). I'm constantly dizzy, out of breath, have blurred vision, fatigued all my life but figured that's how normal people function and realizing now that isn't the case, etc. My aunt had MS (diagnosed at 23), but she's too distant in relation for it to make a difference I believe. I have an MRI of my brain (non-contrast) on Friday but my PCP said ""given my age"", she's sure everything is fine. I know results take a few weeks, and I just want answers. I'll have to be patient, but it's been pulling teeth to get anyone to listen to me so far. Anyway, not looking for a diagnosis, but wondering if this sounds like a lot of things guys have experienced? Or are these symptoms general enough to be something else entirely?

I adopted her and her littermate at the same time, and I do not think I would have survived my diagnosis and so many years of debilitating symptoms without their love. I had her longer than any boyfriend, longer than I have had my husband, longer than any neurologist I have seen or DMD I have tried. She loved me through steroids and fluids and injections and infusions and short/long term disabilities, mobility aids, failed treatments, debilitating fatigue- and above all, the soul crushing loneliness that a chronic disease can bring. I don't know how I'm going to do this life without her. If you have any animals that have helped you cope with this disease hug them tight tonight. ❤️ ETA you guys I'm bawling reading all the comments- I didn't expect this much love and understanding.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705053612391009257/Tired-of-being-tired	Tired of being tired	I have had MS for about 5 years now and it is a very trying disease. I have relapsing/remitting and have been lucky for the most part with only 3 relapses or “episodes” that would be considered major. I sporadically have trouble with tingly extremities, double vision and constant, terrible fatigue. The fatigue is actually my biggest complaint. I have been able to work the entire time, save for some sick time here and there with the flare ups, but it is hard and gets harder every day. I just turned 43 in January and really just want to be able to enjoy my wife and two kids while I can. I know that MS, especially relapsing/remitting, is tough when thinking about disability, but that is kinda what I want to happen. If I knew I could get disability, I would take it and work something part time to offset the financial hit I would take. Is it bad that I want to file for disability? My wife says, “but you're not disabled”. I don't know how I should feel about this or if it is even worth perusing? 	1	1	Tired|of|being|tired	I|have|had|MS|for|about|5|years|now|and|it|is|a|very|trying|disease|.|I|have|relapsing|/|remitting|and|have|been|lucky|for|the|most|part|with|only|3|relapses|or|“|episodes|”|that|would|be|considered|major|.|I|sporadically|have|trouble|with|tingly|extremities|,|double|vision|and|constant|,|terrible|fatigue|.|The|fatigue|is|actually|my|biggest|complaint|.|I|have|been|able|to|work|the|entire|time|,|save|for|some|sick|time|here|and|there|with|the|flare|ups|,|but|it|is|hard|and|gets|harder|every|day|.|I|just|turned|43|in|January|and|really|just|want|to|be|able|to|enjoy|my|wife|and|two|kids|while|I|can|.|I|know|that|MS|,|especially|relapsing|/|remitting|,|is|tough|when|thinking|about|disability|,|but|that|is|kinda|what|I|want|to|happen|.|If|I|knew|I|could|get|disability|,|I|would|take|it|and|work|something|part|time|to|offset|the|financial|hit|I|would|take|.|Is|it|bad|that|I|want|to|file|for|disability|?|My|wife|says|,|“|but|you're|not|disabled|”|.|I|don't|know|how|I|should|feel|about|this|or|if|it|is|even|worth|perusing|?
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4705053612393377671/What-to-do-if-Ocrevus-isn't-working?	What to do if Ocrevus isn't working?	I have had RRMS for a few years now. Even though my symptoms aren't all that bad, my neurologists have never been very happy with my MRIs. As I understand it, I have lots of active lesions and since some are on my spine they are fairly concerned about them. I started on Tecfidera, but my MRIs while on the drug didn't show improvement, plus I had a relapse. So they told me to pick a new one, either Lemtrada or Ocrevus. I decided to go with Ocrevus since it sounded pretty good, and seemed like it had less side effects. I started it last May and everything went fine with the infusions.   The thing is, I had my most recent MRI a few weeks ago. I followed up with my neurologists office to see if they wanted to schedule an appointment. The next one I had on the books wasn't until June, and I wanted to check if they thought I should come in before that to discuss the results. The office got back to me and said she did want to see me soon, and I now have an appointment in a couple weeks.   So now I can't help but feel like they want to see me again because the MRI results are once again not good. I certainly don't feel way better, so it would make sense to me if it's still pretty active. But what is the next step if it's not working? Just give it more time and wait and see? Or is there another medication I should try instead? If anyone has failed out of Ocrevus, I'd love to hear what you did. Although it's still so new I don't think many people have even had the time to fail out of it.   I am trying to not obsess over this until my appointment, but it's hard. Just writing it down feels slightly better, but sometimes this whole thing makes me feel really lonely. I have only really been talking to my partner about this, but I always try and be strong for him so he doesn't have to worry. I guess it makes me feel a bit stronger and more in control somehow if I'm not seeming upset over it. But damn, the waiting sucks. 	1	1	What|to|do|if|Ocrevus|isn't|working|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4704994624932954130/Anosognosia-vs-Denial-of-Disability	Anosognosia vs Denial of Disability	\[reposting as I screwed up the first post\] Anosognosia is a deficit of self-awareness, a condition in which a person with some disability seems unaware of its existence. **Anosognosia results from physiological damage to brain structures**, typically to the parietal lobe or a diffuse lesion on the fronto-temporal-parietal area in the right hemisphere, and is thus a neurological disorder. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia) \----- The bold part suggests to me that anosognosia can be experienced by people with MS who have lesions affecting that part of the brain. It's not a mental condition, it's caused by brain damage. This abstract on PubMed describes it, and me as well: [Denial or unawareness of cognitive deficit associated with multiple sclerosis? A case report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed/24601906). I got a few downvotes in the original post and I'm not sure why. My best guess is I didn't explain it well, so hopefully the Wiki info and the PubMed article help in this post. I had also hoped to connect with others who experience anosognosia as it really sucks. There's nothing like being shocked by your doctor and husband agreeing that you shouldn't be working when you feel like you could do anything. 	1	1	Anosognosia|vs|Denial|of|Disability	\|[|reposting|as|I|screwed|up|the|first|post|\|]|Anosognosia|is|a|deficit|of|self-awareness|,|a|condition|in|which|a|person|with|some|disability|seems|unaware|of|its|existence|.|*|*|Anosognosia|results|from|physiological|damage|to|brain|structures|*|*|,|typically|to|the|parietal|lobe|or|a|diffuse|lesion|on|the|fronto-temporal-parietal|area|in|the|right|hemisphere|,|and|is|thus|a|neurological|disorder|.|[|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia|]|(|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia|)|\|-|-|-|The|bold|part|suggests|to|me|that|anosognosia|can|be|experienced|by|people|with|MS|who|have|lesions|affecting|that|part|of|the|brain|.|It's|not|a|mental|condition|,|it's|caused|by|brain|damage|.|This|abstract|on|PubMed|describes|it|,|and|me|as|well|:|[|Denial|or|unawareness|of|cognitive|deficit|associated|with|multiple|sclerosis|?|A|case|report|]|(|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih|.|gov|/|pubmed|/|2460190|6|)|.|I|got|a|few|downvotes|in|the|original|post|and|I'm|not|sure|why|.|My|best|guess|is|I|didn't|explain|it|well|,|so|hopefully|the|Wiki|info|and|the|PubMed|article|help|in|this|post|.|I|had|also|hoped|to|connect|with|others|who|experience|anosognosia|as|it|really|sucks|.|There's|nothing|like|being|shocked|by|your|doctor|and|husband|agreeing|that|you|shouldn't|be|working|when|you|feel|like|you|could|do|anything|.

The administration says it's because she got caught smoking a cigarette outside. My sister has an adult guardian and she is doing anything about this. She's fine with a very sick 31 year old girl who had her life taken from her by ms be locked in a building surrounded by dying old people. My sister cries everyday. Everyone is rude to my family and no one will tell us when she can leave. Please. Does anyone know what we can do? They have made a bad situation worse. This is tearing my heart up hearing her cry everyday.

He takes Copaxone and was on some kind of assistance program that his late wife was managing but it lapsed when she passed away at the end of 2017. Last year we bit the bullet and paid cash (it was utter chaos and we were all at once trying to deal with her passing and transitioning him to living with my brother, just to scratch the surface), but that's no longer feasible financially. Does anyone know of copayment assistance for Medicare patients (with part D) for Copaxone or a generic? SharedSolutions isn't available for Medicare and the few organizations I've checked either haven't gotten approval for funds or they're depleted already. We haven't had luck with doctor's offices (he lives in a small town and the medical system there is... lacking). Can anybody shed light on this for me?

One of the major symptoms I had was 0 balance and constant vomiting if I didn't lie in a specified position. This passed after a few days in the hospital. Last Saturday, I was having a good day. Spent half of the day active and family came over, but in the afternoon I asked everyone to go home because I felt like my battery was dead. It was followed by the nausea and vertigo and I had to keep a bucket next to me to vomit in. Is this going to be recurring? It's been two days and I'm still bed bound because I can't keep balance.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4704463777148465165/Feel-like-a-fake	Feel like a fake	I (44/f) was dx with RRMS in Oct 2018. I'd been sick with colds over half the year, and I went suddenly deaf in one ear in summer 2018 (the ENT says it's permanent.) I have many lesions in my brain but none on my c- or t-spine. I have some mild weakness on my right, the permanent hearing loss, some mild numbness, and I get really exhausted sometimes. Nobody would ever look at me and guess anything was wrong, though. But here's the truth - I feel like a faker. I can often go hike a few miles, I can walk my rowdy dogs, I can manage my stairs and clean my house and do yard work. I work full time and I'm not married, but I have a teenager. I feel like a faker when my neurologist tells me I am weaker on one side, like I should be trying harder, or when a close friend asks me how I'm doing and I say I've been sore, or that I'm pissed about bumping into things because my balance is off. Some of this is probably because there are so many things that could just be normal aging. And my parents aren't very emotional people, so if I mention anything, my mother tells me she has had the same issues and it's just age. Does anybody else feel like a faker sometimes because it feels like you're too capable, or shouldn't complain? Tl;dr- I feel like I am so capable and look fine, and feel like I'm being too dramatic if I say I'm tired or sore.

I'm the one who switched from Gilenya in July. The last six months have been up and down. A move across country, a liver infection and Hep B scare, a big visiting family thanksgiving in our new city, a trip to South Africa, visiting relatives at Christmas for weeks (!), a fall and a mild concussion 12/27, house hunting in January etc etc Main symptoms left leg pain, walking difficulties due to low stamina and fatigue. January turned out much better than expected. The first week I wrote here about the intense fatigue - but looking back I think that was mild concussion recovery. Starting the second week the generic ampyra kicked in and I was walking up to 7500 steps. Felt much much better. I started the MSGym online membership. Highly recommend. Free on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram too. I started CBD oil to alleviate irritability from ampyra. (I only take 10 mg of ampyra). I use montel Williams cbd caps. So I felt I headed into yesterday's infusion well. HA!!! SIx hours of total boredom and a migraine headache which would not go away. Then horrible large muscle pain in my thighs all night. Missed a fun dinner with friends and was sad they did not call or send home dessert. FWIW I only take 1/2 of steroid protocol dose for premeds due to sensitivities to steroids, but I still feel emotional wreck today. You CAN state your preferences with meds. More Benadryl, less steroids, Tylenol as premed. Migraine gone this morning. Leg muscle pain (which was unlike any MS pain I've had) is mostly gone. Emotional rollercoaster, but Feelings of self pity diminishing. Looking forward to going the the Mets Opera Carmen Matinee simulcast in my city. Final thoughts. First full dose much more intense than the half doses. But next time I'll be prepared. Update. 2 days past infusion. 2 nights poor sleep. Feeling emotional without legit reason.

Neurologist viewed an MRI from June of last year for seeing if I had MS. Should I get another one done?	Hi everyone, I've been lurking around this subreddit for a couple weeks after my primary care doctor had mentioned that I could have MS. My mother has it and I have symptoms that tend to be onset more when I have something like a hot flash. My body feels like it's on fire and my vision blurs. I've had cognitive fog and I feel fatigued all the time. My hands and feet are always cold and my fingers will randomly start getting a prickly sensation like when your foot falls asleep. I've had painful cramping under my rib cage and I pretty much feel like I'm drunk all the time but I haven't had any alcohol. I feel weak all the time, and everything just takes so much effort that I get so fatigued like I'm going to pass out after doing something so simple. I feel like I'm going to pass out or my speech is going to slur as well. My doctor had emailed an MS specialist and he viewed an MRI I had done in June of last year. That was about 9 months ago and I wasn't having any of these symptoms then aside from the vertigo. My mother has MS and hers was diagnosed from a lumbar puncture while her MRI came back negative just as mine did. I asked if I needed to get another MRI since I feel the one the neurologist viewed is outdated but they only want bloodwork. Has anyone ever had an MRI come back negative or have something similar happen? I want to get another MRI but I don't know if they will let me, I just feel like I'm not getting any help and I'm just getting worse by each passing day. 	1	1	Neurologist|viewed|an|MRI|from|June|of|last|year|for|seeing|if|I|had|MS|.|Should|I|get|another|one|done|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4703520059969481386/MS-Breakthroughs-2019-MS-Society-Event	MS Breakthroughs 2019 MS Society Event	# Scene Report: MS Breakthroughs Over the weekend, I attended the MS Breakthroughs event put on by the [National MS Society](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/). The keynote speaker was [Jeffrey Dunn](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/d/jeffrey-dunn.html), director of the Stanford MS Center. The event promised to inform about the current-day MS Breakthroughs as well as the future of MS Research. [Check out the entire episode here: “SCENE REPORT: MS BREAKTHROUGHS”](https://whatsthematterwithme.org/2019/01/31/s3-e2-scene-report-ms-breakthroughs/) ##. Grouping and Splitting Dr. Dunn started off with some history of the MS Society, and its important role fostering collaboration, explaining the scientific paradigm of grouping and splitting. Things start far apart and come together, collaborate, and become normalized, then specialization occurs. Repeat process forever. ## Biology is complicated Biology is complicated – the result of complex processes comprised of many interacting components. Why things happen is often unclear. ## We need a map In MS, the immune system attacks the brain. There are at least a few thousand pathways in the immune system – there's no map. Dunn thinks we need one, because identifying the specific immune pathways driving disease can enable individually tailored treatment ##. Immune Hypertension Dr. Dunn suggested that Multiple Sclerosis is an end-stage name, like referring to a “stove fire” as a “burned down house”. He said a better name might be *immune hypertension.* [Excerpted from What's The Matter With Me?

"Adderall, essential oils, meditation, spirituality, nootropics and all sorts of things I want to ""get off my chest/discuss"" in no particular order."	1. What do you use for focus/fatigue? I'm back on Adderall (which is awesome as I am also back on weight watchers so...) I was on Mofandil for a bit but health insurance approval was a bitch plus I didn't think was as good as Adderall 2. Anyone else find essential oils with a diffuser helps with fatigue, negativity, and depression? I do and I wanted to share and see if anyone has similar experiences or something they like better or is it psychosomatic? If so, what scents do you find helpful? 3. Does anyone take nootropics? I take [these](https://hvmn.com/nootrobox). I think they help, but again, psychosomatic? Beats me 4. I am an atheist but I am real into [Discordianism](http://discordia.wikia.com/wiki/Discordianism). As a 9/11 survivor who was DXed almost 3 months to the day after, well... If I'm wrong and there is a God, when I get there she better get down on her knees and beg MY forgiveness. Do you find spirituality helps you? What kind of things do you do for that sense of inner peace or at least feeling like the cross you bear isn't too heavy? 5. How do you deal with sexual issues? I don't know if this is a Man thing or an Apikoros18 thing but... As mentioned by me in other posts, I need an injection (trimix) to achieve an erection. I cannot masturbate anymore but I still look at adult material. I still look at women, and even more want to have PIV intimacy with my wife. BUT, it can never be spontaneous anymore and with a 9 year old with special needs, even finding the time is difficult, let alone all the prep work. (15 mins for the meds after you take them from the freezer, than the injection, than 15 mins to get an erection) Even then sometimes the meds don't work. They degrade over time and at 175/$ a vial, you want to make it last as long as possible (No pun intended. OK, maybe a little) The bottom line is I still feel horny, I still get arouse (in my head) but the frustration of not being able to act on it.... It hurts me as a man. Yes, I'm in therapy about it but it doesn't stop the thoughts and feelings, the self esteem issues etc. 6. Related to #5, would it be weird to inject myself to jerk off? I feel its weird but I work from home so I could without anyone being the wiser but it feels selfish and weird. Anyway, that's just some stuff going on in my head as I approach year 16 of being diagnosed (and year 2, maybe 3) of being secondary progressive instead of RRMS. 	1	1	"Adderall|,|essential|oils|,|meditation|,|spirituality|,|nootropics|and|all|sorts|of|things|I|want|to|""|get|off|my|chest|/|discuss|""|in|no|particular|order|."	1|.|What|do|you|use|for|focus|/|fatigue|?|I'm|back|on|Adderall|(|which|is|awesome|as|I|am|also|back|on|weight|watchers|so|...|)|I|was|on|Mofandil|for|a|bit|but|health|insurance|approval|was|a|bitch|plus|I|didn't|think|was|as|good|as|Adderall|2|.|Anyone|else|find|essential|oils|with|a|diffuser|helps|with|fatigue|,|negativity|,|and|depression|?|I|do|and|I|wanted|to|share|and|see|if|anyone|has|similar|experiences|or|something|they|like|better|or|is|it|psychosomatic|?|If|so|,|what|scents|do|you|find|helpful|?|3|.|Does|anyone|take|nootropics|?|I|take|[|these|]|(|https://hvmn.com/nootrobox|)|.|I|think|they|help|,|but|again|,|psychosomatic|?|Beats|me|4|.|I|am|an|atheist|but|I|am|real|into|[|Discordianism|]|(|http://discordia.wikia.com/wiki/Discordianism|)|.|As|a|9/11|survivor|who|was|DXed|almost|3|months|to|the|day|after|,|well|...|If|I'm|wrong|and|there|is|a|God|,|when|I|get|there|she|better|get|down|on|her|knees|and|beg|MY|forgiveness|.|Do|you|find|spirituality|helps|you|?|What|kind|of|things|do|you|do|for|that|sense|of|inner|peace|or|at|least|feeling|like|the|cross|you|bear|isn't|too|heavy|?|5|.|How|do|you|deal|with|sexual|issues|?|I|don't|know|if|this|is|a|Man|thing|or|an|Apikoros|18|thing|but|...|As|mentioned|by|me|in|other|posts|,|I|need|an|injection|(|trimix|)|to|achieve|an|erection|.|I|cannot|masturbate|anymore|but|I|still|look|at|adult|material|.|I|still|look|at|women|,|and|even|more|want|to|have|PIV|intimacy|with|my|wife|.|BUT|,|it|can|never|be|spontaneous|anymore|and|with|a|9|year|old|with|special|needs|,|even|finding|the|time|is|difficult|,|let|alone|all|the|prep|work|.|(|15|mins|for|the|meds|after|you|take|them|from|the|freezer|,|than|the|injection|,|than|15|mins|to|get|an|erection|)|Even|then|sometimes|the|meds|don't|work|.|They|degrade|over|time|and|at|175|/|$|a|vial|,|you|want|to|make|it|last|as|long|as|possible|(|No|pun|intended|.|OK|,|maybe|a|little|)|The|bottom|line|is|I|still|feel|horny|,|I|still|get|arouse|(|in|my|head|)|but|the|frustration|of|not|being|able|to|act|on|it|...|It|hurts|me|as|a|man|.|Yes|,|I'm|in|therapy|about|it|but|it|doesn't|stop|the|thoughts|and|feelings|,|the|self|esteem|issues|etc|.|6|.|Related|to|#|5|,|would|it|be|weird|to|inject|myself|to|jerk|off|?|I|feel|its|weird|but|I|work|from|home|so|I|could|without|anyone|being|the|wiser|but|it|feels|selfish|and|weird|.|Anyway|,|that's|just|some|stuff|going|on|in|my|head|as|I|approach|year|16|of|being|diagnosed|(|and|year|2|,|maybe|3|)|of|being|secondary|progressive|instead|of|RRMS|.

I just got out of hospital for a steroid treatment after a new active lesion and new symptoms popped up. It was my 4th stay in hospital for MS. Here's something that never happened before: Doctors & nurses can't seem to find my veins to place injection needles or draw blood. It takes forever, and as soon as there's a needle inside me, the vein breaks and I get a terrible bruise. I look like I got into a fight. They even started injecting my leg vein, because there was no place to stick a needle in either of my arms. Other patients told me, it's normal, that veins ""get worse"". I met someone who had an implanted vein port on her chest to avoid the problem. Has anyone heard of this and made that same experience? Is this due to age? Is this from scarred tissue? Is dehydration a factor? I'm just curious. "	1	1	Trouble|with|injections|.

Recently Diagnosed (37F) Would love to hear what long term medications work for everyone.	"I was diagnosed with relapsing remitting ms on Tuesday. I'm on my third day of steroid infusions (1k mg per day for 5 days). Next, I have to decide what long term treatment plan is best... for me. I've heard the MS field is booming with new information, studies and treatment options. I've also heard there are two camps in terms of meds: initially super aggressive or build up (I'm certain I'm not expressing that properly but hopefully you know what I mean). History I've likely had MS for 15 or so years. I had two ""episodes"" previously (1 15 years ago and 1 10 years ago) but it appears that I was misdiagnosed. The first caused the left side of my body to be weak and somewhat uncontrollable. The second caused my lower extremities to be weak, tingly and have ""foot slap"". In retrospect, there are several small episodes that could lend themselves to MS.... but who knows. My Neurologist has ordered several bloodwork panels and a spinal image. I've already had an MRI with and w/o contrast. I have a follow up in 10 days. Soooo, all the way back around the barn, what medications have improved your symtoms and quality of life?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4703107186653130597/Worries	Worries	Hello everyone My mum got ms for over 25 years now. She sadly lives alone (since my dad died a month ago) but with her parents in the same house. She isn't able to concentrate very long on the same thing and in a kind of permanent confusion about herself, her memories etc. She still can walk but riding a bike or walking down stairs without watching her feet or carrying something the way down or up is impossible. She also has problems about knowing when she has to pee which makes her permanently stressed and hysterical when no toilet is around. However my question is if someone has some tips what she could do with her time since reading or even watching tv is most times to hard for her to keep concentrated. Another problem is that she barely wants to do things alone so also activities that include my grandparents would be very interesting for me. Thanks for helping. 	1	1	Worries	Hello|everyone|My|mum|got|ms|for|over|25|years|now|.|She|sadly|lives|alone|(|since|my|dad|died|a|month|ago|)|but|with|her|parents|in|the|same|house|.|She|isn't|able|to|concentrate|very|long|on|the|same|thing|and|in|a|kind|of|permanent|confusion|about|herself|,|her|memories|etc|.|She|still|can|walk|but|riding|a|bike|or|walking|down|stairs|without|watching|her|feet|or|carrying|something|the|way|down|or|up|is|impossible|.|She|also|has|problems|about|knowing|when|she|has|to|pee|which|makes|her|permanently|stressed|and|hysterical|when|no|toilet|is|around|.|However|my|question|is|if|someone|has|some|tips|what|she|could|do|with|her|time|since|reading|or|even|watching|tv|is|most|times|to|hard|for|her|to|keep|concentrated|.|Another|problem|is|that|she|barely|wants|to|do|things|alone|so|also|activities|that|include|my|grandparents|would|be|very|interesting|for|me|.|Thanks|for|helping|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702930235154548302/More-questions-from-the-medicinally-illiterate	More questions from the medicinally illiterate	First of all I would like to thank everyone for their support. It's been amazing and I'm so glad this reddit exists, so I can come here and ask questions without feeling silly to people who know a lot more than I do and have firsthand experience with MS, instead of just speaking from a physicians perspective. I've been on 1000 mg of prednisone for the last five days. Can move my left side again, still lacking sensations but it's better than nothing. Just scheduled an appointment with the bead of a neuro clinic for the 12th lf February as well so that's something to look forward to. Anyway, what I wanted to ask was, is it normal to feel this blown up on prednisone? I know it chases bloating, but I feel like I literally have the worst sinus infection ever. Like when I bend over all the crud in my head comes to the top and just sits there. It's terrible. I guess what I'm asking is, what was your experience with prednisone if you've taken it? Is this normal for the dosage that's in me or am I just being over dramatic? 	1	1	More|questions|from|the|medicinally|illiterate	First|of|all|I|would|like|to|thank|everyone|for|their|support|.|It's|been|amazing|and|I'm|so|glad|this|reddit|exists|,|so|I|can|come|here|and|ask|questions|without|feeling|silly|to|people|who|know|a|lot|more|than|I|do|and|have|firsthand|experience|with|MS|,|instead|of|just|speaking|from|a|physicians|perspective|.|I've|been|on|1000|mg|of|prednisone|for|the|last|five|days|.|Can|move|my|left|side|again|,|still|lacking|sensations|but|it's|better|than|nothing|.|Just|scheduled|an|appointment|with|the|bead|of|a|neuro|clinic|for|the|12th|lf|February|as|well|so|that's|something|to|look|forward|to|.|Anyway|,|what|I|wanted|to|ask|was|,|is|it|normal|to|feel|this|blown|up|on|prednisone|?|I|know|it|chases|bloating|,|but|I|feel|like|I|literally|have|the|worst|sinus|infection|ever|.|Like|when|I|bend|over|all|the|crud|in|my|head|comes|to|the|top|and|just|sits|there|.|It's|terrible|.|I|guess|what|I'm|asking|is|,|what|was|your|experience|with|prednisone|if|you've|taken|it|?|Is|this|normal|for|the|dosage|that's|in|me|or|am|I|just|being|over|dramatic|?
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702871253730411990/Any-advice-on-talking-to-your-doctor-and-getting-taken-seriously?	Any advice on talking to your doctor and getting taken seriously?	Sorry for the long and poorly formatted post, I'm on mobile. I started ranting and said way more than I thought I would, so: tl;dr I had a bad experience with a doctor being very condescending and dismissive, and now that I worry my symptoms could be MS (experienced MS Hug) I'm not sure how to approach the subject with a different doctor without being dismissed again. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. So for the last several months something has just felt wrong, in a really vague way. I had a standard physical since I couldn't pin point any actual symptoms at the time, and I seemed to be healthy (I had trouble focusing and pretty serious fatigue, but he chalked it up to depression). Alright, not really relieved but it was enough that I could push through it a little longer. Then, a month ago, I had a mild cold. Normal cold symptoms at first, but then I started having trouble breathing. I have asthma so I thought it might be related, but it was a completely different sensation. It was like my diaphragm wasn't working properly. I'd try to take a deep breath and felt as if I physically couldn't. There wasn't pain, but like a band around my torso, I had to change my shirt to make sure that wasn't the issue. Even if I forced it I ended up having to actually change how I was breathing intentionally to feel like I was getting oxygen. Then, it felt as if my hands and feet were asleep, and I felt some numbness. But what really got me freaked was when my face felt like it was asleep. I was lying on the couch because I felt light headed and like I could pass out, so I couldn't understand why my face felt that way. I had to look in the mirror to make sure I wasn't having a stroke. At the time I thought it was related to the cold symptoms so I was thinking maybe mono but it didn't explain everything so I just knew I needed to see a doctor. When I saw the general practitioner the next day, I explained my symptoms (a long list since I wasn't sure what was relevant), and had the normal check up tests (blood pressure, listening to lungs, etc.) and he didn't find anything wrong and my lungs sounded clear, even though I still felt like I couldn't breathe. When I tried to ask what else could be the issue, he started talking to me about anxiety and managing that. I have had an anxiety attack, I know what that feels like, this wasn't it. I was speaking calmly and clearly considering I felt like I might be dying. When I told him it didn't feel like anxiety he just acted sympathetic and asked what I wanted to do. I just want to know what's wrong with me, if I had answers I wouldn't be asking him. But instead of answers I was just condescended to and made to feel like a child. I didn't know what to do so I just left and sat in my car crying because I was so frustrated. And that was that. Since then I've still had issues breathing, my hands shake, I have sharp pains and tingles in weird places, spasms and twitches, and even a tick with one side of my mouth. I'm so exhausted all I do is sleep and work (only 5 hours days because that's all I can handle right now). My feet and hands are often all pins and needles, and I feel like I can't even use my hands properly (I've had to retype most of this because my fingers shake so bad that I miss my intended buttons). I haven't been able to think clearly in months, I constantly forget what I'm doing in the middle of a task or sentence, or do the same thing multiple times because I forget that I just did it. I often feel light headed and wobbly on my feet, I very often bump into walls and furniture or have to stop and wait to move because I'm so light headed. I've recently had trouble even focusing my vision, and just the other day I suddenly wasn't seeing color the same way (I was folding a red shirt, and suddenly it looked tan, I had to walk away and come back before I saw it as red again). I have frequent headaches that vary a lot in location, intensity, and type of pain. I feel incredibly weak, going upstairs to use the restroom is an unbelievable chore. I've felt a consistent, all over ache for a couple years, so much so that I didn't realize how bad it was until I took a painkiller for a fall and suddenly learned how it feels to not have that pain. A couple months ago, the night before I turned 25, I fell down in my living room and dislocated my shoulder. Something is wrong. I don't know what, but it can't be right to feel like my body is failing me at only 25. Despite all of this still being an issue, I don't know how to talk to a doctor. With my history of depression and anxiety I feel like I won't be taken seriously again, despite the fact that I'm being treated for my mental health and have felt better (mentally and emotionally anyway) than I have in years. I know I need to stand up for myself and my health, but I'm not really that kind of person. Does anyone have any advice on how to push this? I was trying to ignore everything and hope it goes away, but then I learned about the MS hug, and it sounded so much like what I have been experiencing. I couldn't find anything that I felt described the sensation, and when I read about the MS Hug it just clicked that this was what I was feeling. Then as I read about more early signs of MS and realized how many I had at one time or another, I saw how serious these things can be (even if it isn't MS, something is wrong) and realized I really need to address this again, and sooner rather than later. So really, any advice would be appreciated. So sorry this is so long, congrats if you managed to read through my ramblings. 	1	0	Any|advice|on|talking|to|your|doctor|and|getting|taken|seriously|?

(i will be switching meds, just not sure to what yet.) i will make an appt with him to come up with a new plan of action. so i suppose i need to -look into international insurance (any recs?) -make sure i have my medical records scanned, -make sure i have contact info for their local MS center, -talk to ms nurses here to see if they recommend i do anything else (i'm an overpreparer....) -any other ideas? sorry for this 'note to self' like entry, i just feel so nervous. perhaps i can also arrange to stay for a shorter amount of time than an entire month. we are also probably going to move... so ...it's just a lot going on and i'm nervous. having a plan, i think, will help... 	1	1	preparing|to|live|in|africa|for|a|month|...|what|should|i|do|in|advance|?	my|husband|and|i|will|be|living|in|north|africa|for|a|month|...|and|i|am|scared|only|bc|of|this|stupid|ms|.|i've|written|before|-|after|my|first|ocrevus|infusion|right|before|december|,|i|got|a|lot|worse|the|next|day|.|noticably|so|.|a|new|part|of|my|foot|became|numb|and|has|not|gotten|better|,|my|thighs|are|heavy|.|no|new|lesions|.|other|new|numbness|came|on|the|next|day|but|went|away|after|about|3|weeks|,|vision|problems|came|the|next|day|too|but|went|away|fairly|quickly|.|i|later|found|out|i|was|recovering|in|a|room|that|had|a|lot|of|mold|in|it|(|i|didn't|know|at|the|time|)|,|not|sure|if|this|has|anything|to|do|with|my|worsening|.|sucks|.|i've|been|in|a|general|panicky|state|lately|bc|i|wonder|if|i'll|ever|get|better|,|and|now|i'm|extra|afraid|of|being|in|a|new|land|and|feeling|like|i|feel|now|.|i|guess|i'm|ok|here|sitting|around|on|my|computer|most|of|the|day|,|so|i|should|be|ok|doing|the|same|there|.|i|just|get|nervous|.|right|now|i'm|not|on|meds|bc|the|doctor|had|said|,|since|i|already|did|the|first|infusion|,|i|can|hold|off|a|bit|.|(|i|will|be|switching|meds|,|just|not|sure|to|what|yet|.|)|i|will|make|an|appt|with|him|to|come|up|with|a|new|plan|of|action|.|so|i|suppose|i|need|to|-|look|into|international|insurance|(|any|recs|?|)|-|make|sure|i|have|my|medical|records|scanned|,|-|make|sure|i|have|contact|info|for|their|local|MS|center|,|-|talk|to|ms|nurses|here|to|see|if|they|recommend|i|do|anything|else|(|i'm|an|overpreparer|...|)|-|any|other|ideas|?|sorry|for|this|'|note|to|self|'|like|entry|,|i|just|feel|so|nervous|.|perhaps|i|can|also|arrange|to|stay|for|a|shorter|amount|of|time|than|an|entire|month|.|we|are|also|probably|going|to|move|...|so|...|it's|just|a|lot|going|on|and|i'm|nervous|.|having|a|plan|,|i|think|,|will|help|...

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702458375738541654/Insurance-Sucks	Insurance Sucks	Sorry friends, I just need to vent. After starting work after graduating in May I was given insurance that I took alongside my parents insurance. I had no idea about coordination of benefits or the like, and as I moved closer to my dx I continued to use my parents insurance none the wiser. Now here we are 3 infusions and 4 MRIs in and I am just now discovering that every single test, office visit, and infusion claim is being retroactively denied/put on hold because of COB. The amount of money that totals out to is starting to weigh on me and the people close to me can tell. I know nothing is set yet but it's so hard to keep on smiling and going through when I know I have this mountain in front of me to climb.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702281427667124330/Specialist-Vs.-Ms-Clinic	Specialist Vs. Ms Clinic	At the worst possible time (upcoming medication switch), my neurologist is retiring. He wasn't a specialist at a clinic but he did, in his younger days, work at one so he knew MS. He was very well versed in MS. Now I have to find a new one. My choices: 1) MS clinic at a large hospital but will be a 3 hr drive to and another three hour drive back. So 6 hrs. in total and I am not in good health 2) General neurologist. A lady who doesn't specialize in MS but my family doctor said other MS patients seem to like her My question is this: What benefits will I have using a clinic with a specialist in MS vs a general neurologist? Do hospitals get new medication first or first crack at treatments? Does anyone here have a generalist and is happy? Or should I do the drive and head over to the clinic?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702163464865225440/MS-or-Lyme-or-both???	MS or Lyme or both???	I was diagnosed with MS in 2016 shortly after having my child. My initial symptoms were weakness on the left side, tremors, and the inability to open and close my left hand. This lasted for a few weeks after which time I got an MRI, and 3 lesions were found. The neuro diagnosed me with MS at that point. Since then, I have had optic neuritis and some extreme fatigue. After the second attack, I went on Copaxone and have been taking it since. In December of 2017, I went to see a functional medicine doctor in the states and had a ton of tests/blood work done, and one of the findings was Lyme disease. I had tested negative for the Canadian test (which is apparently common, as the testing in Canada isn't as robust as other countries), but I was positive for several other tests in the states. I've been seeing a Lyme specialist since then, and I had more testing done, and it has been confirmed that I have active Lyme disease. I've also been told that Lyme can manifest itself very similarly to MS, hence the question in my subject line. The dilemma I'm facing is whether I have Lyme disease AND MS or just Lyme. Since there is no test per se for MS, my neuro said that it can never be 100% confirmed. In the meantime I'm still taking Copaxone, and I may not really need to. I need to figure this out so that I can deal with it and move on versus being in this perpetual state of limbo. Has anyone else tested positive for Lyme disease after an MS diagnosis? If so, how did you navigate through it? Thank you!!! 	1	1	MS|or|Lyme|or|both|?|?|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4702163464866389443/Asking-for-a-friend	Asking for a friend	Hi all,   My best friend was finally diagnosed (after several years of studies) with NMO. He visited several doctors in Argentina, and for around 10 years (from 2006 to 2016) he got a lot of different oppinions because some thought he had cardiovascular problems, while others thought he had some neural problem.   The thing is, we've been reading (he can't speak english), and it's weird that the AQP4-Ab was negative for him. The doctors don't want to medicate him, but he feels he's still deteriorating. They also told him that they don't recommend he looks for more opinions, as they are probably the most experienced doctors in MS in Argentina.   What I'd like to ask here is: is it possible to contact some professionals here? He's not a rich man, but he can afford to travel to another country if he will get more studies/opinions/treatment. But he can't afford to travel just to try to meet a doctor. He needs to contact one from here and travel with a concrete examination plan.   Can you please let me know if this is possible? Meet a professional through reddit? He just gave me his complete medical history, which I can translate to english and send along with all the tests that have been performed to him in the last 10 years.

So, I went into the doctor, who referred me to a neurologist and ordered an MRI. The MRI shows a 2.8 cm lesion on my brain stem, but basically no other activity since the lesion from 9 years ago.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4701278727418342376/Its-so-hard-watching-my-moms-progression-after-relapsing.	It’s so hard watching my moms progression after relapsing.	Hello, I can't remember if I've posted here before. I usually lurk. Tonight I'm just here to get this off my chest, I'm thankful for a place where I am able to do so. My mom (56) was diagnosed with MS just after I was born, about 20 years ago. I've never known her without MS. Of course while I was growing up she only needed canes for long distance, and could still stand well on her own and get around alright. Looking back I wish I had known what we had then. Over the last 3-4 years she's had multiple bad relapses they have all landed her in the hospital for a few nights. Each time she comes out with much less mobility than before. I am having such a hard time watching her struggle just to move. Hunched over, body bent, so obviously uncomfortable, just trying to get to the bathroom in time. I truly have a hard time looking at her sometimes because I can't help but cry. It breaks my heart seeing her this way. I am about to graduate from university and I feel so paralyzed to start my life. I feel so guilty even thinking of moving out and getting a full time job, even though I have a dream that I need to follow. I know she needs me there to take care of her and I can't imagine leaving, as much as I can't imagine not working towards my dream job. I'm so angry that she's confined like this. She rarely wants to leave the house anymore because getting back upstairs is starting to get too hard. I can't stand to think of her stuck inside for the rest of her life. We were blessed to find this house to rent 10 years ago and now it's become an everyday hurdle just to live in it. Late last year my dad (56) was diagnosed with Parkinson's. I can't bear to think of going through this all over again with him. He gets so frustrated with her lack of abilities already, as does she, and now he's going to experience it all for himself. I feel so powerless to help and so unable to heal and start my life. We don't have the money to get a nurse or caretaker, nor am I qualified to give them the help they need and are going to need down the road. I don't know what to do. I've had such a hard time sleeping since my dads diagnosed, thinking of what life will be like this time next year. I don't want to admit it but I get so jealous when I see able bodied family's on vacation or at the movies or just going for a walk around the block. I guess I'm just upset thinking about the quality of life that's been stripped from them. How I wish I could take away their pain. Thank you for letting me get that out, I feel better having somewhat put my thoughts into words. 	1	1	It|’|s|so|hard|watching|my|moms|progression|after|relapsing|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4701219744096802931/Just-diagnosed	Just diagnosed	Hello everyone. My symptoms started just this week on Sunday, and in that time frame they've worsened to the point my left side is incredibly weak and heavy (basically can't use it) and my right is numb, minimal to no sensation. After two MRIs I've been diagnosed, due to two lesions on my cervical spine and... probably some in my brain, I haven't looked at the results yet. This all happened so fast and I feel like I'm in limbo right now. For things to change so fast, it's like it's not real and it will all go away soon. What are all of your experiences with MS? How do you cope, and manage your health? I would like to do the best I can to prevent it from progressing. It's a scary thing for me because no one in my family has had it. I'm 19F and frankly quite scared. 	1	1	Just|diagnosed	Hello|everyone|.|My|symptoms|started|just|this|week|on|Sunday|,|and|in|that|time|frame|they've|worsened|to|the|point|my|left|side|is|incredibly|weak|and|heavy|(|basically|can't|use|it|)|and|my|right|is|numb|,|minimal|to|no|sensation|.|After|two|MRIs|I've|been|diagnosed|,|due|to|two|lesions|on|my|cervical|spine|and|...|probably|some|in|my|brain|,|I|haven't|looked|at|the|results|yet|.|This|all|happened|so|fast|and|I|feel|like|I'm|in|limbo|right|now|.|For|things|to|change|so|fast|,|it's|like|it's|not|real|and|it|will|all|go|away|soon|.|What|are|all|of|your|experiences|with|MS|?|How|do|you|cope|,|and|manage|your|health|?|I|would|like|to|do|the|best|I|can|to|prevent|it|from|progressing|.|It's|a|scary|thing|for|me|because|no|one|in|my|family|has|had|it|.|I'm|19F|and|frankly|quite|scared|.

My neurologist said I've had MS for a while. So I've been thinking back over the years and trying to figure out what might have been possible relapses and if there was anything they all had in common. I've had everything from leg weakness, arm weakness, vertigo, trouble talking, trouble swallowing, bladder issues, etc. the only common thing I can see is that every time I had other symptoms I also had extreme fatigue. Like couldn't keep my eyes open at work and fell asleep in meetings.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4701101781545976040/Rebif-break	Rebif break	26 (M) here, dx in spring 2017 and on rebif since January 2018. First time poster, lurker since before my diagnosis. I've been handling the rebif pretty well, you know, ups and downs. Currently not taking any antidepressants or anything of that sort. Disease quite stagnant, i.e. no new lesions in the past three MRIs, but with frequent minor symptoms like a numb arm here and there, some lhermitte's ever so often. I work a stressful desk job in an international organization, and am about to go on a 2 week vacation, traveling around Europe a bit (currently living in Italy). Since I don't actually get a lot of these breaks, and also because my neurologist made this reference during our last checkup, I would like to take a 2 week break from the rebif, and restart once I am back home. Sort of a break from my day to day self/ms/routine. The neurologist (mind you one of the best in the country on MS, like borderline famous) mentioned he usually gives his (older/other) patients therapy breaks, where he allows them to go off medication for a (what he thinks is a calculated) period, so they can actually enjoy their winter/summer/Easter holidays. I also checked with him on my particular case and his answer was “have a nice holiday without the medication”. Since I'm quite new at this, and because reading around has not actually helped me find a lot about such breaks, I was just wondering if any of you wonderful souls have ever gone through this and if you think it's a good idea to just go full out on this vacation. TL;DR going on a 2 week vacation and neurologist said it was fine to stay off the rebif. 	1	1	Rebif|break	26|(|M|)|here|,|dx|in|spring|2017|and|on|rebif|since|January|2018|.|First|time|poster|,|lurker|since|before|my|diagnosis|.|I've|been|handling|the|rebif|pretty|well|,|you|know|,|ups|and|downs|.|Currently|not|taking|any|antidepressants|or|anything|of|that|sort|.|Disease|quite|stagnant|,|i|.|e|.|no|new|lesions|in|the|past|three|MRIs|,|but|with|frequent|minor|symptoms|like|a|numb|arm|here|and|there|,|some|lhermitte's|ever|so|often|.|I|work|a|stressful|desk|job|in|an|international|organization|,|and|am|about|to|go|on|a|2|week|vacation|,|traveling|around|Europe|a|bit|(|currently|living|in|Italy|)|.|Since|I|don't|actually|get|a|lot|of|these|breaks|,|and|also|because|my|neurologist|made|this|reference|during|our|last|checkup|,|I|would|like|to|take|a|2|week|break|from|the|rebif|,|and|restart|once|I|am|back|home|.|Sort|of|a|break|from|my|day|to|day|self|/|ms|/|routine|.|The|neurologist|(|mind|you|one|of|the|best|in|the|country|on|MS|,|like|borderline|famous|)|mentioned|he|usually|gives|his|(|older|/|other|)|patients|therapy|breaks|,|where|he|allows|them|to|go|off|medication|for|a|(|what|he|thinks|is|a|calculated|)|period|,|so|they|can|actually|enjoy|their|winter|/|summer|/|Easter|holidays|.|I|also|checked|with|him|on|my|particular|case|and|his|answer|was|“|have|a|nice|holiday|without|the|medication|”|.|Since|I'm|quite|new|at|this|,|and|because|reading|around|has|not|actually|helped|me|find|a|lot|about|such|breaks|,|I|was|just|wondering|if|any|of|you|wonderful|souls|have|ever|gone|through|this|and|if|you|think|it's|a|good|idea|to|just|go|full|out|on|this|vacation|.|TL|;D|R|going|on|a|2|week|vacation|and|neurologist|said|it|was|fine|to|stay|off|the|rebif|.

I met my MS nurse on Monday, and I thought I would be starting a DMT, but we only discussed the options and I have to wait for the consultant to make the final decision, so another 2-4 weeks. I'm fed up of having to keep waiting because I want to be doing everything I can to reduce the risk of relapses. I'm especially worried by having had 3 definite relapses in less than a year.

Since my doc tells my disease is mild going with the heavy duty stuff (I was thinking ocrevus) she advised starting more middle of road. Gileyna worried me because of the heart rate thing so we decided on Tecfidera and she is going to rx me with Gabapentin for the muscle pain and banding I've been having. I was wondering if any of you wonderful people had any advice or experiences with either or both. And thank you all so much, I swear this community keeps me sane. Update: Thank you soo much for the information and experiences. I'm pretty sure I'm dealing with a flare up right now, two days not at work with all of the exhausted fun of MS. I am REALLY looking forward to starting treatment so these days of feeling useless happen less. I am super lucky to have an amazing boss. 	1	1	Tecfidera	Greetings|my|fellow|MS|warriors|!|I|was|dxd|in|late|November|and|saw|my|neurologist|today|to|pick|a|DMT|.|Since|my|doc|tells|my|disease|is|mild|going|with|the|heavy|duty|stuff|(|I|was|thinking|ocrevus|)|she|advised|starting|more|middle|of|road|.|Gileyna|worried|me|because|of|the|heart|rate|thing|so|we|decided|on|Tecfidera|and|she|is|going|to|rx|me|with|Gabapentin|for|the|muscle|pain|and|banding|I've|been|having|.|I|was|wondering|if|any|of|you|wonderful|people|had|any|advice|or|experiences|with|either|or|both|.|And|thank|you|all|so|much|,|I|swear|this|community|keeps|me|sane|.|Update|:|Thank|you|soo|much|for|the|information|and|experiences|.|I'm|pretty|sure|I'm|dealing|with|a|flare|up|right|now|,|two|days|not|at|work|with|all|of|the|exhausted|fun|of|MS|.|I|am|REALLY|looking|forward|to|starting|treatment|so|these|days|of|feeling|useless|happen|less|.|I|am|super|lucky|to|have|an|amazing|boss|.

Source: https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-01-cells-brains-multiple-sclerosis-patients.html JANUARY 23, 2019 Old cells repair damage in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients by Karolinska Institutet A new study shows that there is a very limited regeneration of cells in the brains of patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). These findings underline the importance of treating MS at an early stage of disease progression, when the affected cells can repair the damage, as they are not replaced by new ones. The results are published in the journal Nature by researchers from Karolinska Institutet and Uppsala University in Sweden. Nerve cells in the brain communicate with one another through nerve fibres that form complex networks. Many nerve fibres are insulated by a casing of myelin, which contributes to the high-speed transmission of nerve impulses. Myelin is not formed by the nerve cells but by another type of cell called oligodendrocytes. MS is a disease caused by the body's immune system attacking the myelin and oligodendrocytes. This leads to deteriorated transmission of signals in the nerve fibres and can entail nerve cell death, a combination that causes serious neurological impairments and in severe cases the patient's death. The disease progression in MS usually fluctuates between periods of deterioration and periods of remission. **Studies in mice have shown that damaged myelin can be reformed, and that this requires generation of new oligodendrocytes that make the myelin. It has been assumed that periods of remission in MS patients are caused by newly formed oligodendrocytes replacing the lost myelin.** **But in this study, a research group has been able to show that there is no regeneration of oligodendrocytes in MS patients in those areas where the myelin seems to have been reformed. Instead, it appears as if old oligodendrocytes that have survived the attack from the immune defence are able to form new myelin.** **""We were highly surprised that humans proved to be so different from the animals that have been studied. In humans, there is very limited regeneration of oligodendrocytes, but they seem to have a greater capacity to contribute to repair,"" says Jonas Frisén, Professor at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology at Karolinska Institutet, who led the study.** **These new findings indicate the importance of treating MS aggressively at an early stage of the disease progression, in order to prevent the loss of oligodendrocytes.** **""Since few oligodendrocytes are formed, it is important to save the ones you have as they can repair the damage caused by the disease,"" says Jonas Frisén.** To determine the age of the oligodendrocytes in the MS patients, the researchers measured the amount of the isotope carbon-14 from nuclear detonations during the cold war, which was stored in the cells' genome, i.e. the DNA. Since the detonations ceased, there has been a gradual decrease of carbon-14, which acts as a type of date mark for when the cells were formed. This method of determining the age of a cell was developed by Jonas Frisén's team in the early 2000s. **Another paper is published simultaneously in Nature, from Associate Professor Gonçalo Castelo-Branco's group also at Karolinska Institutet, arriving at overlapping conclusions, with a different methodology.** Two studies referenced: More information: Dynamics of oligodendrocyte generation in multiple sclerosis, Nature (2019).

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4700747884982474093/Redefining-A-Cure-For-Multiple-Sclerosis	"Redefining A ""Cure"" For Multiple Sclerosis"	"With the work that I do, I get to see a lot of articles about multiple sclerosis research in the media that overhypes results and findings, often using the ""c"" word to do so. I have to admit that as soon as I see that, I get worried. Knowing that the cause of MS is still not known, I think that the idea of a cure is extremely unlikely in the near future. However, I do think that we are possibly getting to a point where we can start to think of a 'cure' in a different sort of sense. What if we could almost completely manage the disease? It's not a cure in a traditional sense of the word, but could it be just as good? A while ago I wrote this opinion piece for the MStranslate website on exactly that topic. I thought it would be worth sharing here and discussing with everyone. I was going to just copy and paste the article, but it would be difficult to get the images and formatting right...so I'm just going to copy the link (see below). I'd love it if you could read it and then let me know what your thoughts are and please ask me any questions that you might have.

New Products Intended to Stimulate Feet of MS Patients - has anyone tried anything like this?	This reads like a press release, but ... I'd still be interested in trying this... has anyone out there tried something like this? Source: https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2019/01/24/products-naboso-stimulate-feet-ms-patients/ New Products Intended to Stimulate Feet of MS Patients JANUARY 24, 2019 BY JONATHAN GRINSTEIN IN NEWS. Naboso Technology has expanded its product offerings with new insoles and training mats specifically designed to stimulate the nervous system through the skin on the bottom of the feet. The products were developed to help improve balance, posture, movement and restore motor function, as part of a neurorehabilitation strategy for patients with chronic neurological disorders and motor neuron diseases. Those include multiple sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Common symptoms in patients with neurological conditions are poor posture, balance instability, and compromised gait. From an increased likelihood of falling to reduced independence, compromised motor function and stability can lead to a range of issues that have a negative impact in these patients and their families, emotionally and economically. . Research has shown that sensory stimulation of the feet can improve dynamic stability. “Whether we are focused on multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease, our greatest concern is maintaining their ability to move, walk and experience life,” Naboso Technology stated on its website. “Walking difficulties can happen to anyone with a chronic neurological condition, but interventions exist. Something as simple as a texture insole can have a profound impact on these individuals' movement patterns and quality of life.” When walking, running, and using your feet, touch or sensory stimulation of any of the hundreds of nerves sensitive to mechanosensation — pressure, stretch, vibration, and texture — creates an access point between the environment and the brain to better control movement coordination and improve posture. These nerves in the feet go all the way to the somatosensory cortex (the region of the brain devoted to perceiving sensation) to aid in shaping motor movement. Simply stated, the better the ability to feel sensory stimuli, the better the ability to move. Although sensory stimulation of feet has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to improve dynamic stability in patients with chronic neurological disorders, its incorporation into neuro-rehabilitation has been limited. “Since our launch in 2017, Naboso Technology has been on a mission …. to bring an awareness to the power of sensory stimulation in optimizing foot function,” Emily Splichal, MD, said in a press release. Splichal is founder of Naboso Technology and a functional podiatrist. “The Naboso Insoles are uniquely designed to stimulate the nerves in the plantar foot, which in turn has an effect on foot activation, foot strength, and postural alignment. Our minimal design and low profile allows the Naboso Insoles to fit into a variety of shoes and athletic footwear,” Splichal said. The insoles and mats were designed for training and rehabilitation, especially for patients with neurological disorders, but also professional athletes. On their website, Naboso Technology wrote: “We have seen incredible, immediate results by putting the Naboso Textured Insole into the shoes of multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's patients. We have videos of patients who can barely walk and now are running! The power of the foot cannot be overlooked.”. 	1	1	New|Products|Intended|to|Stimulate|Feet|of|MS|Patients|-|has|anyone|tried|anything|like|this|?

I've seen the highs and lows from my mom as I've grown throughout the years, I am 25 years old now. Back around 07-08 she gave me a couple of the red silicon HOPE bands she purchased and I instantly fell in love with them. Always wearing them to support my mom, so much that it became part of my character too. In 2010 I put one of the wristbands on and that wrist band did not leave my wrist until it broke today 1/24/2019. 9 years that band was on my arm and never came off. It snapped off my wrist from being so thin after all the wear on it. I am heartbroken. I know the new ones are orange but the red one just means so much to me I am coming to you guys for help of finding another. It would mean the absolute world to me. Just like my mom I know you guys are fighting your hearts out and I am always rooting for you guys. https://imgur.com/a/DXowJf2 Heres a picture of the bracelet tonight when it snapped.

I was curious if anyone else experiences this issue and if you had any tips to help besides the obvious just hibernate ( which is all I want to do). Thanks and I hope everyone is doing well! 	1	1	Temperature|changes|.

Researchers from Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin have discovered how the body initiates repair mechanisms which will limit the extent of any damage to this sheath. Their findings, which provide a basis for the development of new drugs to treat multiple sclerosis, have been published in the eminent journal Nature Communications*. Multiple sclerosis is the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Estimates suggest that more than 200,000 people are affected by the disease in Germany alone. People with multiple sclerosis experience vision and sensory problems, as well as impaired coordination or even paralysis. These symptoms are caused by the disruption of nerve impulses in either the brain or the spinal cord. This disruption occurs when the body's immune system attacks the myelin sheath, which is wrapped around the body's nerve fibers and provides electrical insulation. When the myelin sheath is no longer intact, communication between nerve cells is impaired. Researchers across the globe are searching for new ways to repair the myelin sheath and, in doing so, are looking to reduce neurological symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis. Researchers from Charité have now moved a decisive step closer to this goal. Charité's research team decided to take a closer look at the body's innate ability to heal itself, knowing that, under certain conditions, the central nervous system is capable of repairing damage to the myelin sheath. Specific molecular signals enable stem cells to differentiate into myelin repair cells (oligodendrocytes), which reside in a small stem-cell niche in the brain. Once they leave this niche, these repair cells migrate to where myelin damage has occurred in order to restore the affected nerve cells' electrical insulation. Until now, very little had been known about the molecular signals responsible for initiating this myelin regeneration mechanism. ""We have found that the Chi3l3 protein plays a central role in the body's capacity to produce new myelin-forming oligodendrocytes,"" says the study's first author, Dr. Sarah-Christin Staroßom of Charité's Institute for Medical Immunology. A researcher at the NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence and the Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Dr. Staroßom explains the protein's role as follows: ""The Chi3l3 protein initiates the differentiation of neural stem cells into myelin repair cells, which restore the electrical insulation around damaged nerve cells."" Using a mouse model, the research team were able to show that a reduction in Chi3l3 levels in the brain significantly impairs the body's capacity for oligodendrocyte production, while a Chi3l3 infusion leads to an increase in the production of myelin repair cells. The same reaction was observed during an in vitro experiment using human cells. ""We hope to use this knowledge to develop a new generation of drugs that can be used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis,"" explains Dr. Staroßom. ""As a next step, we will study in greater detail whether Chi3l3 or related proteins can be used to reduce the neurological symptoms of patients with multiple sclerosis."" ###. *Starossom SC et al., Chi3l3 induces oligodendrogenesis and reduces disease severity in an experimental model of autoimmune neuroinflammation.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4699981113535834717/Do-people-with-MS-all-kinds-always-have-a-much-worse-progression-after-having-kids?	Do people with MS (all kinds) always have a much worse progression after having kids?	Title says my question. I know statistically women usually have a better experience with MS while pregnant which has led to many studies itself (awesome). But the overwhelming majority of what I've read online and heard says that the progression and prognosis for that MS patient gets significantly worse after having kids often starting with a really bad relapse the year following pregnancy and a faster progression to SPMS. This antagonizes me far more than it should because my mom literally went to MS hell after having me. I know it's not my fault and I tell myself that but my brain likes to jump elsewhere. From leaving me at bus stops as a kid to not even remembering me now; but it's hard to find studies with conclusive evidence suggesting much else. To be fair I guess since I got MS too it's some sort of karmatic justice if it was my fault but that doesn't really do much to help my sanity lol. Nobody should have to deal with this disease. Science aside, I want to hear from some people who have actually experienced this (or not) themselves. Edit: sources. More research needs to be done especially with DMTs being used after having kids and hopefully the increased relapses after pregnancy don't contribute to disease progression. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-017-0562-7 https://scholar.google.com/scholar? start=20&q=ms+disease+activity+postpartum&hl=en&as_sdt=0,24&as_ylo=2015&as_vis=1#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DtmfofeLgtDkJ https://clinicalmolecularallergy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12948-016-0048-x. 	1	1	Do|people|with|MS|(|all|kinds|)|always|have|a|much|worse|progression|after|having|kids|?

Also, side question. I've been noticing more white lights in my eye that has ON during exercise and heavy breathing - I would get maybe one or two lights every few days, but this morning I got six lights within 10 minutes.

At the time I was diagnosed I was 16 and now I'm 17. At first, in September, I was put on corticosteroids for a few days short of one week and the symptoms I had been experiencing went away. Now only tremors and instability walking persist. Now, since I am underage I couldn't actually take any medicine. But, there has been a change in the criteria that need to be fulfilled in order to get on the waiting list. The most major criterion that got removed said 1 year after confirming the diagnosis had to pass in order to be put on the list.

Such measures can delay progress to the second stage of the disease, which is characterized by progressive levels of physical and mental disability. The study is the first to provide evidence that currently-available treatments can delay the progress of MS. Preventive measures The study used data from 1555 patients from 68 neurological clinics across 21 countries. Tomas Kalincik, Associate professor at the University of Melbourne and study co-lead author, says that the findings showcase how important proactive treatment is in dealing with MS. The research focused on patients with relapsing-remitting MS commencing or clinical monitoring between 1988-2012 with minimum 4 years' follow-up. “People who converted from relapsing MS to secondary progressive MS experience gradual and mostly irreversible worsening of disability,” he explained. “Most of the therapies that we use to treat MS have no effect once people have converted to secondary progressive MS.” Currently, more than 23,000 Australians are living with MS, the paper explains. The conversion to the secondary progressive stage of MS is characterized by worsening of physical and mental capacity. The team, therefore, argues that preventive treatment is a very powerful tool in improving the quality of life for MS patients. “This study shows that the therapies they have been treated with for many years, significantly improve the quality of their lives over the long-term,” Kalincik said. Patients included in the study that underwent “initial treatment with fingolimod, natalizumab, or alemtuzumab” had a reduced risk of developing second-stage MS over a 5-year period. All drugs studied here showed different results, although all were effective. For example, patients initially treated with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta had a 12% chance of conversion to secondary MS, compared to 27% for the control group. Early fingolimod treatment reduced this risk to 7% compared to 32% for controls, and natalizumab to 19% compared to 38% for controls. Kalincik said he hopes the results will reassure both neurologists and patients with MS that the disease can be managed, and the worst of it avoided — if treatment is started in time. The findings should also help point to the optimal path for treatment, the study adds. The paper “Association of Initial Disease-Modifying Therapy With Later Conversion to Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis” has been published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 	1	0	"""|The|worst|of|multiple|sclerosis|can|be|avoided|or|delayed|with|early|treatment|"""	Study|this|article|is|based|on|:|https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2720726|Source|:|https://www.zmescience.com/science/multiple-sclerosis-treatment-82534524/|The|worst|of|multiple|sclerosis|can|be|avoided|or|delayed|with|early|treatment|LAST|UPDATED|ON|JANUARY|19TH|,|2019|AT|6:21|PM|BY|ALEXANDRU|MICU|A|new|study|led|by|researchers|from|the|Royal|Melbourne|Hospital|and|the|University|of|Melbourne|found|that|early|treatment|—|particularly|within|five|years|of|onset|—|is|effective|in|delaying|the|progress|of|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|.|Such|measures|can|delay|progress|to|the|second|stage|of|the|disease|,|which|is|characterized|by|progressive|levels|of|physical|and|mental|disability|.|The|study|is|the|first|to|provide|evidence|that|currently-available|treatments|can|delay|the|progress|of|MS|.|Preventive|measures|The|study|used|data|from|1555|patients|from|68|neurological|clinics|across|21|countries|.|Tomas|Kalincik|,|Associate|professor|at|the|University|of|Melbourne|and|study|co-lead|author|,|says|that|the|findings|showcase|how|important|proactive|treatment|is|in|dealing|with|MS|.|The|research|focused|on|patients|with|relapsing-remitting|MS|commencing|or|clinical|monitoring|between|1988-2012|with|minimum|4|years|'|follow-up|.|“|People|who|converted|from|relapsing|MS|to|secondary|progressive|MS|experience|gradual|and|mostly|irreversible|worsening|of|disability|,|”|he|explained|.|“|Most|of|the|therapies|that|we|use|to|treat|MS|have|no|effect|once|people|have|converted|to|secondary|progressive|MS|.|”|Currently|,|more|than|23,000|Australians|are|living|with|MS|,|the|paper|explains|.|The|conversion|to|the|secondary|progressive|stage|of|MS|is|characterized|by|worsening|of|physical|and|mental|capacity|.|The|team|,|therefore|,|argues|that|preventive|treatment|is|a|very|powerful|tool|in|improving|the|quality|of|life|for|MS|patients|.|“|This|study|shows|that|the|therapies|they|have|been|treated|with|for|many|years|,|significantly|improve|the|quality|of|their|lives|over|the|long-term|,|”|Kalincik|said|.|Patients|included|in|the|study|that|underwent|“|initial|treatment|with|fingolimod|,|natalizumab|,|or|alemtuzumab|”|had|a|reduced|risk|of|developing|second-stage|MS|over|a|5|-|year|period|.|All|drugs|studied|here|showed|different|results|,|although|all|were|effective|.|For|example|,|patients|initially|treated|with|glatiramer|acetate|or|interferon|beta|had|a|12|%|chance|of|conversion|to|secondary|MS|,|compared|to|27|%|for|the|control|group|.|Early|fingolimod|treatment|reduced|this|risk|to|7|%|compared|to|32|%|for|controls|,|and|natalizumab|to|19|%|compared|to|38|%|for|controls|.|Kalincik|said|he|hopes|the|results|will|reassure|both|neurologists|and|patients|with|MS|that|the|disease|can|be|managed|,|and|the|worst|of|it|avoided|—|if|treatment|is|started|in|time|.|The|findings|should|also|help|point|to|the|optimal|path|for|treatment|,|the|study|adds|.|The|paper|“|Association|of|Initial|Disease-Modifying|Therapy|With|Later|Conversion|to|Secondary|Progressive|Multiple|Sclerosis|”|has|been|published|in|the|Journal|of|the|American|Medical|Association|.

He said he has to work with science and he has seen no study that follows long term efficiency of drugs and MS progression.

Finally saw a neurologist today and have cervical and brain MRIs scheduled for next week and early February. My question to this group is related to vitamin B12: According to a variety of National Institutes of Health documents, a vitamin B12 deficiency (more accurately, a failure of the body to absorb B12 due to a lack of intrinsic factor) causes lesions that result in symptoms that look a lot like MS. I've searched this subreddit but not found many people who've talked about B12. I know a B12 blood test can show sufficient levels but still leave one suffering from a deficiency since the body isn't absorbing it. I'd like to know if anyone here had a blood test for intrinsic factor levels in the course of their MS diagnosis. I'm sure you're all great folks, but I definitely don't want to join your club! :) Thanks for any info. 	1	0	vitamin|B12|deficiency|and|intrinsic|factor|levels	I've|been|having|a|variety|of|worsening|neurological|symptoms|for|2.5|years|now|.|Finally|saw|a|neurologist|today|and|have|cervical|and|brain|MRIs|scheduled|for|next|week|and|early|February|.|My|question|to|this|group|is|related|to|vitamin|B12|:|According|to|a|variety|of|National|Institutes|of|Health|documents|,|a|vitamin|B12|deficiency|(|more|accurately|,|a|failure|of|the|body|to|absorb|B12|due|to|a|lack|of|intrinsic|factor|)|causes|lesions|that|result|in|symptoms|that|look|a|lot|like|MS|.|I've|searched|this|subreddit|but|not|found|many|people|who've|talked|about|B12|.|I|know|a|B12|blood|test|can|show|sufficient|levels|but|still|leave|one|suffering|from|a|deficiency|since|the|body|isn't|absorbing|it|.|I'd|like|to|know|if|anyone|here|had|a|blood|test|for|intrinsic|factor|levels|in|the|course|of|their|MS|diagnosis|.|I'm|sure|you're|all|great|folks|,|but|I|definitely|don't|want|to|join|your|club|!|:)|Thanks|for|any|info|.

Could a safer version (using Sephin1) of an old blood pressure drug (Wytensin/guanabenz) be repurposed in multiple sclerosis?	"Let's hope it works in humans :-) Source: https://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/uchicago-scientists-turn-to-safer-myelin-protecting-candidate-for-multiple-sclerosis Could a safer version of an old blood pressure drug be repurposed in multiple sclerosis? by Angus Liu |. Jan 17, 2019 11:35am In 2015, a team of scientists at the University of Chicago found that the hypertension drug Wytensin (guanabenz) could prevent myelin loss and alleviate symptoms of multiple sclerosis in animal models. Now, that team has returned with data showing that a similar drug with the same myelin-protecting mechanism could serve as a safer alternative. MS is triggered by an autoimmune attack on myelin-producing cells called oligodendrocytes. Once these cells are damaged, myelin—the protective sheath around nerve cells—degenerates and eventually causes nerve-cell death. In a [recent study] (https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awy322/5289373? rss=1) published in the journal Brain, a team led by Brian Popko, Ph.D., showed that a small-molecule derivative of Wytensin called Sephin1 could “delay the loss of myelin and postpone the onset of debilitating disease” in a mouse model of MS, Popko said in a statement. Popko was also the senior author of a 2015 Nature Communications study on Wytensin. At that time, Popko and colleagues demonstrated that in mouse models of MS, Wytensin appeared to enhance the integrated stress response, a protective mechanism that maintains cellular proteostasis—or the balance of proteins—and protects cells from inflammatory damage. The animals treated with Wytensin were protected against oligodendrocyte and myelin loss and saw delayed onset and reduced severity of MS symptoms. However, Wytensin has one major shortfall: Due to its affinity to the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor, it can cause side effects such as drowsiness, lethargy and even coma at high doses. So for the new study, Popko's team focused on Sephin1. Here's how his team believes it works: As part of the integrated stress response, an enzyme called eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) is ""phosphorylated,"" or modified in a way that allows the synthesis of proteins that guard against inflammation. Sephin1 prolongs that protective response by selectively inhibiting a gene called PPP1R15A, they believe. And Sephin1 plays another critical role, they added. “By protecting oligodendrocytes and diminishing demyelination we also reduce the generation of myelin debris,” Popko said in a statement. “The decreased exposure to myelin fragments should also limit the auto-immune response.” The findings echoed a 2015 study published in Science. In that research, a University of Cambridge-led team showed that Sephin1 didn't cause the adverse effects of Wytensin. It enhanced the integrated stress response in mice, preventing the protein-misfolding diseases Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Current MS treatments focus mainly on limiting the immune system's attack, but they can cause side effects including brain infections. So restoring the myelin sheath could represent a better approach, the UChicago team figured. And they're not alone. Researchers at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, for example, previously reported that a microRNA called miR-219 could restore the function of oligodendrocytes. Because Sephin1's mechanism is different from traditional immune-modulating MS therapies, Popko's team believes a combination treatment may be promising. In their new study, they found that adding Sephin1 to the standard MS therapy interferon-beta did produce some benefits. For example, the animals that received the combo treatment experienced an even more dramatic decline in disease development than those that got Sephin1 alone, the team reported. “These data indicate that combining Sephin1 and [interferon-beta] provides an additive therapeutic benefit in ameliorating and delaying the symptoms of [MS],” the researchers wrote in the study.

"I've been with my husband for 9 years soon, and he was diagnosed with MS 8 years ago. Since he got diagnosed the responsibility for most things fell on me. Here is the thing though. I could be okay with him not doing much when he's having a bad day. But that's not what's happening. He says he can do something, then it turns out he can not. And instead of talking to me about it and telling me he can't, he just hides it from me. Like finances. I think we have money saved up, but we don't, because he messed up and did not tell me, and when I say ""let's go out and eat! Can we afford that this week?"" he just say yes and run the credit card. Later I have to take from my savings to cover our bills. For the longest I felt bad for splitting our finances since I earn the most, but I just had to do it after the last 2500$ I had to cough up. Same with emotions. I had to go somewhere on his birthday. I asked him several times if this made him feel bad. He repeatedly said no, since we had the day together and I was not leaving until in the evening anyway. Later he's using it against me. And it's not like he's telling me ""I know I said I was okay about the birthday thing, but after you left I discovered I was not."" he just keeps a grudge until he can use it as ammo. We're polyamoures, so this one is not really cheating, but I've been struggling with intimacy because 1. I work a lot and is dead tired (to cover for all the money he spent) and 2. Sex has a lot to do with trust for me and I felt strongly that trust has not been present for a long time. (we still had sex, just not as often as he wished.) So, he sleeps with a girl that's HIV positive because he did not mind not doing fluid exchanges with me for a few weeks anyway until he got tested. So now there is no sex. I can say something and then he adds to the story until it's unrecognizable. For an example, he asks me just as I wake up how I'm doing. I say I'm tired. Later that day he asks if I'm safe to drive since I did not sleep last night. Or, I'm a little annoyed with something he did or didn't do, and then asks if he should go sleep in the car that night since (according to him) I'm breaking up with him. Is this a thing that people with MS does? I have so many examples of times I think we agreed on something and then he acts like the exact opposite was decided, or the story is twisted out of proportions! I feel I can't trust him on anything, and that he treats me like a person I'm not. Like everything I say has another meaning to it in between the lines even though I pride myself on being a direct and clear talker. "	1	1	My|(|F34|)|husband|(|M35|)|with|MS|is|wearing|me|out|.

So recently I had a mammogram and when I went into my chart I noticed that Multiple Sclerosis was listed as one of my diagnosis from 2016. At that time I was experiencing brain fog, extreme tiredness, fatigue. After MRI my doctor said it looked pretty normal and advised me to see a psychologist for further testing which i did not do as I started feeling better and chalked it up to extreme stress. The MRI report itself says ""given the patients age. An early demyelinating process cannot be excluded"" but ""at a minimum, there is no clear demyelinating lesion"" There is ""minimal marginal periventricular flair hyperintense signal alteration slightly more marked in frontal horns"" and ""minimal marginal pericallosal flair hyperintense signal alteration"". I dont know what that means, really. So, is this an error in my chart or what?! I do have a call into the neurologist to clarify. I have had other weird symptoms in the past five months like chills down one leg and pins and needles sensations in my arm, electrical zaps to my foot, pelvis.

"I've been dealing with bouts of dizziness, ringing, fullness in ears, clumsiness, confusion, fatigue, hearing problems, tingling at the top of my head, black waves in my vision, inability to focus, and a great many other things for about 4 years Now (23m). Over the last year, all of my issues have gotten exponentially worse. It's starting to affect my life. My GP never took me seriously on it. I finally went to see a psych after a family member suggested it because I was struggling at work. The psych said that I've got pretty severe ADHD. The meds help with the concentration issues depending on the day, but nothing else. He said that I should see an ENT for the other stuff. The ENT did a great many tests, and told me that he is 90% sure that I have meniere's disease based on the tests, but the type of dizziness that I get doesn't really match up. This became especially obvious after doing several more test on my vestibular system that showed I have almost no ability to determine fast I'm moving, just that I'm moving. He said that type of result doesn't typically show up with meniere's, so he sent me to get an MRI. He said that he found some unusual things on the MRI, but not the unusual things he was looking for. He said he was writing a referral for me to get checked for MS. The MRI says ""periventricular hyperintensities are nonspecific"" the rest of the MRI was deemed ""normal"". I decided to have a look at the MRI and found what I believe he was talking about. There's three white blobs where there shouldn't be on the t2 FLAIR scans. One large one, and two smaller ones closer to the occipital area. My mother has MS, but I had never considered that I might as well. It does make sense though after taking everything into account. Hers actually started the same way. I know that I'm not a doctor, and that there is multiple things that can cause these hyperintensities areas. So I'm refraining from jumping to conclusions. The neurologist my ENT referred me to couldn't see me til July, so I moved away from that route. My mom gave me the number to the neurologist that finally diagnosed her after 20 years. He actually specializes in MS and is considered one of the best. They said to send in the MRI report, and they would call to let me know if he'd see me. I sent the report earlier today. I worry that the wording of the MRI report is going to cause him to turn me away seeing as it doesn't describe the hyperintensities at all. It just says that they're there. I really just don't want to end up like my mom who went 20 years trying to figure out why her life was so hard. How would you guys handle this? I was hoping I could just drop off the MRI CD so he could just have a look himself, but the receptionist cut me off.(my mom said she acted the same way with her) I'm not freaking out, or really worried much.

I could eat frozen foods, meats, and really anything I wanted. However, I've noticed that I can taste a new flavor in a lot of different foods, particularly frozen meats/foods. I was wondering if anyone else had started to taste an iodine flavor in their frozen foods after being diagnosed?   I understand that the diagnosis does not change the ability to taste different things, though I distinctly remember never having this problem prior to that fateful week in the hospital. Additionally, I have had severe problems with red meats. They just don't agree with my stomach anymore and it is very sad because I love a good steak! 	1	1	Food|related|observation	So|prior|to|being|diagnosed|I|never|really|had|any|issues|eating|different|kinds|of|foods|.|I|could|eat|frozen|foods|,|meats|,|and|really|anything|I|wanted|.|However|,|I've|noticed|that|I|can|taste|a|new|flavor|in|a|lot|of|different|foods|,|particularly|frozen|meats|/|foods|.|I|was|wondering|if|anyone|else|had|started|to|taste|an|iodine|flavor|in|their|frozen|foods|after|being|diagnosed|?|I|understand|that|the|diagnosis|does|not|change|the|ability|to|taste|different|things|,|though|I|distinctly|remember|never|having|this|problem|prior|to|that|fateful|week|in|the|hospital|.|Additionally|,|I|have|had|severe|problems|with|red|meats|.|They|just|don't|agree|with|my|stomach|anymore|and|it|is|very|sad|because|I|love|a|good|steak|!

I was just diagnosed a few months ago and this is my first medication. I haven't had any crazy side affects so far (some minor flushing and digestive things if I don't take it with sufficient food) but overall I'm optimistic. I'm feeling much more awake in the morning than I have in a long time and my only remaining symptom from my recent flare ups is the vibrating/buzzing feeling in my lower back and legs every now and then. Only odd thing that I'm wondering if it's a possible side affect is that I'm a few days late (~5) on my usually regular monthly cycle. I'm definitely not pregnant, and it's not too far past yet so I'm not too concerned. I'm mostly curious if anyone else noticed a shift in menstruation due to starting an MS medication as that wasn't a side affect I had heard about. 	1	1	Cycle|shifting|side|affects|of|DMTs|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4697621817494378578/HSCT-study-out-in-JAMA	HSCT study out in JAMA	still too risky for my taste. STUDY: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2720728 ARTICLE BELOW - source: https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/some-multiple-sclerosis-patients-knocking-out-immune-system-might-work-better-drugs For some multiple sclerosis patients, knocking out the immune system might work better than drugs By Kelly ServickJan. 15, 2019 , 11:15 AM In multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that strips away the sheaths that insulate nerve cells, the body's immune cells come to see the nervous system as an enemy. Some drugs try to slow the disease by keeping immune cells in check, or by keeping them away from the brain. But for decades, some researchers have been exploring an alternative: wiping out those immune cells and starting over. The approach, called hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), has long been part of certain cancer treatments. A round of chemotherapy knocks out the immune system and an infusion of stem cells—either from a patient's own blood or, in some cases, that of a donor—rebuilds it. The procedure is already in use for MS and other autoimmune diseases at several clinical centers around the world, but it has serious risks and is far from routine. Now, new results from a randomized clinical trial suggest it can be more effective than some currently approved MS drugs. “A side-by-side comparison of this magnitude had never been done,” says Paolo Muraro, a neurologist at Imperial College London who has also studied HSCT for MS. “It illustrates really the power of this treatment—the level of efficacy—in a way that's very eloquent.” Nearly 30 years ago, when hematologist Richard Burt saw how HSCT worked in patients with leukemia and lymphoma, he was struck by a curious effect: After those patients rebuilt their immune systems, their childhood vaccines no longer protected them, recalls Burt, now at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Evanston, Illinois. Without a new vaccination, the new immune cells wouldn't recognize viruses such as measles and mumps and launch a prompt counterattack. That suggested that in the case of an autoimmune disease, reseeding the immune system might help the body “forget” that its own cells were the enemy. Burt and others have since used HSCT for a variety of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. In the past few years, several teams have reported encouraging results in MS. But only one study—which evaluated just 17 patients—directly compared HSCT to other available drug treatments. In the new trial, Burt and his colleagues recruited 110 people with the most common form of MS, known as relapsing-remitting. In that form of the disease, patients can go long periods without symptoms—which include muscle weakness and vision problems—before inflammation flares up. Trial participants had at least two such relapses in the previous year, despite being on one of several approved MS drugs. Half the participants continued with drug treatment but switched from a drug that wasn't working for them to a drug of a different class. The other half underwent HSCT. First, the researchers collected their blood to reinfuse later. Then, they gave patients a combination of drugs to kill most of their immune cells. In this trial, the patients would have regenerated their own immune systems with stem cells in bone marrow that were spared annihilation, Burt notes. But they received the reinfusion of their own stem cell-rich blood to help speed recovery by several days. A year later, the researchers evaluated how far the disease had progressed in each of the patients. According to a zero-to-10 scale of disability that includes measures of strength, coordination, and speech, roughly 25% of those in the drug treatment group showed at least a one-point worsening in their score, compared with just 2% of those in the transplant group, the researchers report online today in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). MRI scans also revealed less extensive brain lesions in the transplant group and improvements in a patient survey about quality of life. (Survey scores worsened slightly in the drug-treated group.) Five years after treatment, about 15% of people in the transplant group had had a relapse, versus about 85% of the control group. The two groups diverged “in a massive way,” Muraro says. But he adds that two of the most effective MS drugs weren't included in the control group. One, ocrelizumab, had not been approved when the study was enrolling participants. Another, alemtuzumab, was excluded because it also depletes immune cells and might have increased the risk of complications in patients from the control group who were later allowed “cross over” and undergo HSCT. That “doesn't detract from the beauty of the results,” Muraro says, but it means future studies should compare HSCT strictly with the most potent drugs on the market. In the new study, where patients spent about 2 weeks in the hospital, there were no deaths or life-threatening complications. But there is still “a hard core of skepticism” about HSCT among physicians, Muraro says, largely because chemotherapy carries risks of infections and complications. As University of Ottawa hematologist Harold Atkins points out in a cautious editorial in JAMA today, researchers have reported deaths in trials for other autoimmune diseases using the same HSCT procedure. But Muraro notes that the overall mortality rate associated with HSCT for MS now stands at less than 1%. Burt acknowledges the procedure has risks—and that most MS patients likely aren't candidates. HSCT should be considered for people with the relapsing-remitting disease and frequent relapses, he says, before they enter a progressive phase of the disease, in which symptoms gradually worsen without intervening attacks. He estimates that about 15% to 20% of people with MS are candidates for HSCT. Meanwhile, there's evidence of growing enthusiasm for the procedure, at least in Europe. A recent survey found a sharp spike over the past 5 years in the use of patients' own stem cells to treat autoimmune diseases. The source of that spike, the study said, was an increase in clinical centers using the approach to treat MS.

Leiden chemists discovered a new mechanism which might explain how multiple sclerosis shifts to a more severe form. Their findings contribute to unraveling the mysterious course of the disease. They have published their findings in the journal Biochemistry.	"puzzle pieces continue to come together.... source: https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-01-unraveling-mysteries-multiple-sclerosis.html JANUARY 14, 2019 Unraveling the mysteries of multiple sclerosis by Leiden University In their publication in Biochemistry, Can Araman and Sander van Kasteren from the Leiden Institute of Chemistry and Bert 't Hart from the Biomedical Primate Research Centre came one step closer to revealing the mysterious disease mechanisms of severe progressive MS. In their research, they delved into the fact that the risk of getting MS is highly associated with infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Almost 95 percent of the world population carries this virus, opposed to a percentage of 100 percent in MS patients. All MS patients thus carry EBV. Progressive MS More than 2 million people worldwide are suffering from multiple sclerosis, in short MS. This multifaceted disease affects the immune system and damages the cells of the central nervous system. MS is divided into different types and progressive states of the disease. The most common form is the relapsing-remitting type. People with this type of MS experience periods of relapse in which new symptoms appear, alternated by periods of recovery. The other types of MS are all progressive and more severe. In the progressive types, symptoms worsen over time, with or without periods of relapse and recovery. The shift to progressive MS is not yet fully understood. While adequate treatment for the most common type of MS exist, only limited treatment possibilities are available for the more severe types, due to its enigmatic disease mechanism. MS affects the so-called myelin oligodendrocye protein (MOG). Araman explains that normally, this protein is part of a shield that is wrapped around the cells of the central nervous system. It protects them from getting damaged by external stimuli, both physical and chemical. ""What has been previously known is, in the case of MS, MOG is degraded and this so-called shield is damaged,"" he tells. ""The nerve cells are therefore less protected."" Because of its altered shape, cells of the immune system no longer recognize the degraded shield as part of the own body. They see components of the degraded shield as a treat. Hence, MOG is taken up by the cells of the immune system, subsequently causing an immune reaction and leading to the known immunity-driven disease pattern in MS. **In addition to this already known mechanism, Araman and his colleagues now discovered a second mechanism in which MOG plays a part. It might explain how MOG contributes to the onset of progressive MS. The researchers found that EBV infection modifies the protein in such a way that it forms highly-structured and insoluble assemblies of MOG, that form so-called amyloid plaques (see frame). ""These plaques are of toxic nature and also appear in other diseases affecting the central nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease and Morbus Parkison, formed by distinct proteins,"" Araman tells. ""They kill the cells in which they were produced."" But that's not all. This aggregated version of the protein becomes non-antigenic meaning it is not recognized by the immune system anymore. It therefore silences the immune response to these harmful portions of MOG.** Shift explained? **The findings show that progressive MS not only has properties of an autoimmune disease, but also is a so-called amyloidopathy, a disease in which amyloid plaques are formed, that affects the central nervous system. Up to now, there were only clinical symptoms to differentiate between progressive MS and the other forms of the disease. ""We showed that a protein that is first attacked by the immune system in MS, becomes non-antigenic and kills the cells in which it is produced upon aberrant modification,"" Araman explains. ""This might be the mechanism that explains the shift to progressive MS."" This new knowledge might contribute to new methods of treatment. ""In the future we might be able inhibit the neurodegeneration in progressive MS, by selectively targeting this harmful modification and the enzymes that catalyse the subsequent reaction.""** Amyloids are aggregates of proteins that become folded into a shape that allows many copies of that protein to stick together, forming fibrils. In the human body, amyloids have been linked to the development of various diseases.

"Hello friends, I have a jacked up nose, my septum is severely deviated, but I've never really had sinus issues until I was getting diagnosed (my sinus headaches prompted the first MRI that lead to my diagnosis!) I had a ""sinus infection"" every month for 3 months. My front teeth hurt, my sinuses hurt, my nose feels raw and runny, and occasionally I get AWFUL headaches in my forehead, just above my nose. Antibiotics fixed me up after a few days each time. So, I finally got around to seeing an ENT. She tells me my nose is jacked up, and I could get surgery to fix it in the future, but I DON'T HAVE A SINUS INFECTION! And she doesn't think I ever did! She is linking it to ON. I was told I have optic neuritis at the Mellen Center, but I dont see the optic neurologist (sooo many doctors!) until mid February. I have absolutely no treatment yet for MS or ON. Im finishing the insurance dance now, and will begin Glatiramer Acetate injections in the next weeks. I'm wondering, does anyone here have ON that messes with your sinuses? Does this even make sense? I feel like its been one thing after another, and I feel the sinus stuff coming on a few days before the biggest fundraising event of the year at work. Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated! TL;DR: An ENT thinks optic neuritis is causing symptoms similar to a sinus infection. Anyone else have this experience?

How many of us MSers have multiple diagnoses, autoimmune or otherwise? Share if you feel comfortable.	"Lazyfisher: * Migraines - I can trace back to first or second grade. * MS - diagnosed 1991, but can, post diagnoses, trace first exacerbation back to 1980. I was fifteen. * Diabetes Type II - brought on by high dose steroids less than 30 days apart. * Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura - or very low platelet count - also brought on by the above mentioned steroids. ITP scared me. More than MS ever has and even more than almost being in a coma from a very excessive BS of 1354. Not fun. The ITP was way higher on the scary factor. GP did a blood test in his office after looking at my ""rash."" Turned out to be petechiae. GP comes back in and tells me to use extra caution driving home, sit on my sofa, and surround myself with pillows. The only good thing to have come out of that year was the course of Rituxan I was given to treat the ITP. [For those in the know, I tried steroids, they caused major havoc with my BG. Had the splenectomy, didn't work.] My neurologist believes the course of Rituxan is the reason I've been stable for so long. **Different topic, but related:** Is anyone here really good with medicines? I have a question in regards to using Ocrevus and what will it do to my platelets? I've spoken to my pain management guy, PhD in Pharmacology, neurologist, GP, and for nurses at Genentech.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4696973010921705252/Is-MS-really-one-disease?	Is MS really one disease?	I have been thinking about this a lot lately. I go to numerous MS groups and talk to tons of people with MS (the clinic wait is often 2-3 hrs. ). It's so bizarre how different the course of this disease is with different people. Yes, there are a cluster of symptoms but it's all over the place. One thing that got my gears grinding was my last visit to the clinic. A group of us were talking about medication and it's bizarre how some people get all kinds of good benefits from a medication, others get a little, some get none at all and others totally despise it with numerous and unbearable side effects. I mean you get diabetes, you get insulin. It works the same for most, more or less. But with MS....it's all over the map. Is this more than one disease and we aren't there yet in detecting more evidence to differentiate between the diseases? Sorry for this but I was thinking about this all weekend due to the vast amount of people who have differing opinions on the same treatments. If this is the case wouldn't the best course of action be to put all funding into a remyelination treatment so MS becomes like Diabetes and we control it instead of trying to stop or cure it? 	1	1	Is|MS|really|one|disease|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4696973010922275695/Severe-Fatigue	Severe Fatigue	I have a question about periodic episodes of severe fatigue. I have daily fatigue of different sorts (cognitive, but mainly physical and muscular) that many people talk about. This isn't what this post is about. What I'm talking about is that once in a while (maybe 1-2 times a month but it really varies) I get an absolutely severe episode of fatigue where I sleep for *days*. It's so intense that I feel like I'm almost unconscious or in a coma like state. I can't no matter how hard I try wake up or get up or do anything. It's really scary. The closest thing I can compare it to is when I had the flu once where I slept for like 4 days straight. I also notice some other symptoms like tingling in my legs and a little bit of numbness, or feeling dizzy, but usually something slightly off in addition to the fatigue. And then after days of this its like the light switch turns on in my body and I regain the feeling of normalcy. I have brought this up to my neurologists in the past and they either brushed it aside or told me that it doesn't sound like typical MS fatigue. I need to figure out what causes this and what to do about it?? Has this happened to anyone else and any suggestions? Having several days in a row where I cam completely incapacitated is a really ridiculous way to live. 	1	0	Severe|Fatigue	I|have|a|question|about|periodic|episodes|of|severe|fatigue|.|I|have|daily|fatigue|of|different|sorts|(|cognitive|,|but|mainly|physical|and|muscular|)|that|many|people|talk|about|.|This|isn't|what|this|post|is|about|.|What|I'm|talking|about|is|that|once|in|a|while|(|maybe|1-2|times|a|month|but|it|really|varies|)|I|get|an|absolutely|severe|episode|of|fatigue|where|I|sleep|for|*|days|*|.|It's|so|intense|that|I|feel|like|I'm|almost|unconscious|or|in|a|coma|like|state|.|I|can't|no|matter|how|hard|I|try|wake|up|or|get|up|or|do|anything|.|It's|really|scary|.|The|closest|thing|I|can|compare|it|to|is|when|I|had|the|flu|once|where|I|slept|for|like|4|days|straight|.|I|also|notice|some|other|symptoms|like|tingling|in|my|legs|and|a|little|bit|of|numbness|,|or|feeling|dizzy|,|but|usually|something|slightly|off|in|addition|to|the|fatigue|.|And|then|after|days|of|this|its|like|the|light|switch|turns|on|in|my|body|and|I|regain|the|feeling|of|normalcy|.|I|have|brought|this|up|to|my|neurologists|in|the|past|and|they|either|brushed|it|aside|or|told|me|that|it|doesn't|sound|like|typical|MS|fatigue|.|I|need|to|figure|out|what|causes|this|and|what|to|do|about|it|?|?|Has|this|happened|to|anyone|else|and|any|suggestions|?|Having|several|days|in|a|row|where|I|cam|completely|incapacitated|is|a|really|ridiculous|way|to|live|.

Fearful my 19 year old daughter ha ms	"I will try to be somewhat consice. My daughter is 19. She has a long history of migraines. In November of 2017 she experienced new symptoms to her migraines. She had very sharp debilitating pain behind her eye. It would come on in a flash, last a few seconds, and then dissapate without going away completely. This happened on and off for a couple of weeks. Finally went to ER. They diagnosed her with cluster headaches on top of migraines. Her pediatrician referred her to a neurologist. It took four months to get in to see the Dr. her first visit was March of 2018. At some point she started complaining of joint pain in her right knee and hip. The nerologist had an MRI without contrast done. It came back clean. She prescribed her Gabapentin to prevent the migraines and help with her pain. Eventually her dosage was increased to 1200 Mg a day. Since then her pain has never gone away. She has days where it is better or worse, but never completely gone. She really never complained about it much. She would occasionally mention it, but (I hate to admit it) I didn't think too much about it. I finally realized how serious it was when she started using the elevator instead of taking the stairs at school. (She has Aspergers which may or not be related to her discomfort on elevators) Since then we are persuing what is going on with her. All of her symptoms or possible symptoms. Who knows what is actually a symptom or not. Right knee and hip pain Left leg weak and collapses almost dragging like. Hard to describe Stumbles, wobbly at times Neck stiff and painful Has trouble sleeping, but has never slept well Anxiety but something she has dealt with off and on for years Stomach pain. (She doesn't know if it is naseau or not. She has never been able to distinguish naseau from hunger or something else.) Muscle twitch Seems like a lot of sugar makes it worse Her menstrual cycle seems to make it worse She still has the eye pain new migraine /cluster-headache pain She has to use the restroom during the night (Maybe because she just wakes up a lot) Cold weather makes her feel better Her symptoms come and go. Sometimes very debilitating and sometimes mild. Sometimes some go away completely only to come back. Things we have done or dr has had done not in a specific order She went gluten free it had no discernable impact She took Cymbalta it didn't do much and she had side effects She was tested for Lyme disease She had xrays on her knee and hip. They showed nothing. Her blood panel is all normal She was given prednisone which helped temporarily This brings us to a few weeks ago. The doctor (not her neurologist who had her follow up with her regular Dr for pain) said she is sure it is neurological, but did not specify beyond that. She actually made that comment in passing. It didn't register until later what it meant. So the she was given an MRI with and without contrast on head and cervical spine. (While waiting for the results I google what the difference was between contrast and without and discovered multiple sclerosis. So I can't get my brain to stop thinking about it. So many things seem to fit, but that could be tunnel vision on my part. So the results of the MRI is the cervical is normal, but the brain MRI showed a lesion on the left petrous ridge. A CT Scan was done and was normal. We were referred to a neurosurgeon, and see him in just over a week. So now we wait, and think, and stress, and think, and over think, and stress some more. I am not asking for a diagnosis from online. I would appreciate any insight you may have. For example is the petrous ridge even in an area that could be a lesion from Ms? Does it sound like I am really jumping to a farfetched possibility? I know we have to essentially just wait until we see the neurosurgeon. Of course that may not actually answer anything. I can see the neurosurgeon saying, ""She doesn't need surgery. Go back to the other Dr."" We want an answer, but know we may not get one. But we don't want her to have ms, but we want an answer, and a course of action. Then I feel ludicrous thinking we will be relieved with a diagnosis of anything even Ms. But she does have something wrong even I if there is no diagnosis. So in addition to any insight you may have I could use some calm down words of wisdom if that makes any sense. Because my calm down, be patient, and wait voice is not working at the moment. If anyone made it all the way through this, thank you, I appreciate your time. What are your thoughts?

After 12 years, my neurologist has gently hinted before Christmas that we're looking at a transition to SPMS. Of course I forgot to ask him some questions about that, was kind of a shock. Recently I have had some new and resurgent functional losses without obvious inflammation, or any notable new lesions visible via MRI. Maybe worth noting that I have 30+ MRI-visible historical lesions. Is this typical of SPMS? I haven't been able to find anything online specifically about imaging and its ability to indicate SPMS progression. e: sorry I meant to say 'show on MRI' in the title, but titles are immutable :(. 	1	1	Does|Secondary-Progressive|MS|progression|typically|how|on|MRI|?

Hi, I am still awaiting concrete diagnosis but I've wanted to ask whether MS symptoms can change between days and during the day? Example: One day I wake up, my right hand feels stiff and clumsy but during after a few hours this feeling disappears? One day I've bit of a numbness in finger, next day it's gone. Also crazy mood swings. One day I am doom and gloom, next day I feel fine. For the past two months I've had constant tingling/buzzing in my feet however with various intensity during the day - it can go from almost unbearable to almost not feeling it. No numbness though. What complicates things is that I have cerebral palsy and possible frontal epilepsy - so preexisting spasticity and gait problems makes things harder to diagnose/pinpoint. Also been suffering from anxiety so I have been attributing all these weird sensations to that for the past years and learned to ignore them but the nonstop buzzing in feet has not gone away and now I am back in the neuro loop again. It just keeps harder and harder to attribute all these weird sensations to either CP/anxiety or epilepsy. 	1	0	Can|MS|symptoms|come|and|go|during|the|day|/|days|or|subside|and|increase|?

UCLA researchers correct genetic mutation that causes IPEX, a life-threatening autoimmune syndrome. Has potential implications for MS and other autoimmunes.	Source: http://newsroom. ucla. edu/releases/correct-genetic-mutation-causes-ipex-autoimmune-syndrome UCLA researchers correct genetic mutation that causes IPEX, a life-threatening autoimmune syndrome Mirabai Vogt-James |. January 10, 2019 UCLA researchers led by Dr. Donald Kohn have created a method for modifying blood stem cells to reverse the genetic mutation that causes a life-threatening autoimmune syndrome called IPEX. The gene therapy, which was tested in mice, is similar to the technique Kohn has used to cure patients with another immune disease, severe combined immune deficiency, or SCID, also known as bubble baby disease. The work is described in a study published in the journal Cell Stem Cell. IPEX is caused by a mutation that prevents a gene called FoxP3 from making a protein needed for blood stem cells to produce immune cells called regulatory T cells. Regulatory T cells keep the body's immune system in check; without them, the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs, which is known as autoimmunity. The approach adds a normal copy of the FoxP3 gene to blood stem cells, which can produce all types of blood cells. In the study, the approach corrected the genetic mutation in mice with a version of IPEX that's similar to the human version of the disease, and it restored proper immune regulation. To get the normal copy of the FoxP3 gene to the proper place within the blood stem cells, the researchers used a tool called a viral vector — a specially modified virus that can carry genetic information to a cell's nucleus without causing a viral infection. The UCLA team engineered the viral vector used in the study so that the gene is turned on only in regulatory T cells, but not in other types of cells. “It's exciting to see how our gene therapy techniques can be used for multiple immune conditions,” said Kohn, a professor of pediatrics and microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCLA. “This is the first time we've tested a technique that targets an autoimmune disorder, and the findings could help us better understand or lead to novel treatments for other autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis or lupus.” The name IPEX stands for immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked. The syndrome can affect the intestines, skin and hormone-producing glands such as the pancreas and thyroid, as well as other parts of the body. It is typically diagnosed within the first year of life and can be life-threatening in early childhood. IPEX can be treated with a bone marrow transplant, but finding a matched bone marrow donor can be difficult, and the transplant procedure is often risky because people with IPEX can be very sick. In the new study, the UCLA researchers used viral vectors to deliver normal copies of the FoxP3 gene to the genome of the mice's blood stem cells so that they produced functional regulatory T cells. All of the mice in the study were virtually free of IPEX symptoms shortly after the treatment. “It's incredibly important that we only create regulatory T cells that have the non-mutated FoxP3 gene,” said Katelyn Masiuk, a student in the UCLA physician-scientist degree program and the study's first author. “We found that if the FoxP3 protein is turned on in blood stem cells, the whole blood system functions abnormally. We realized that we needed a vector that only made FoxP3 in the regulatory T cells made from the blood stem cells, but not in the blood stem cells themselves or other types of blood cells they make.” The researchers also put their IPEX-targeting vector into human blood stem cells and then transfused those cells into mice without immune systems. The human blood stem cells were able to produce regulatory T cells that turned on the vector. Kohn, who also is a member of the UCLA Children's Discovery and Innovation Institute and the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, said the results are promising and the researchers hope to test the approach in human patients. Kohn said that to treat humans with IPEX, blood stem cells would be removed from the bone marrow of patients with IPEX. Then, the FoxP3 mutation would be corrected in a lab using the IPEX-targeting vector. The patients would receive a transplant of their own corrected blood stem cells, which would produce a continuous life-long supply of regulatory T cells. Kohn is also the principal investigator in a clinical trial that is testing the use of patients' own genetically corrected blood stem cells to treat sickle cell disease, the most common inherited blood disorder in the U.S. And in another study led by Kohn, a similar technique has cured 40 babies with SCID. Kohn, Masiuk, Dr. Roger Hollis (a study co-author and member of Kohn's lab) and Dr. Maria Grazia Roncarolo of Stanford University are inventors of the FoxP3 vector, for which a patent application has been filed by the UCLA Technology Development Group on behalf of the Regents of the University of California. The FoxP3 vector for IPEX is not yet available in clinical trials and has not been approved by the FDA for use in humans. The research was funded by the UCLA Molecular Biology Institute's Whitcome Predoctoral Training Program and the T32 Medical Scientist Training Program, a program of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. 	1	0	UCLA|researchers|correct|genetic|mutation|that|causes|IPEX|,|a|life-threatening|autoimmune|syndrome|.|Has|potential|implications|for|MS|and|other|autoimmunes|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4696147201760640620/Anyone-else-miss-the-life-they-used-to-have?	Anyone else miss the life they used to have?	I think I'm having a bit of a pity party today. Still trying to come to terms with the diagnosis and waiting for everything to get worked out with insurance so I can start taking meds. I don't mean this to sound like I'm bragging. Just want to give a little background about me. I'm 41, an aerospace engineer (design planes), kids that are 13 and 15. I've never done drugs, rarely drink alcohol (never been drunk), don't drink caffeine, lift weights a lot, and run 10 miles a week. I used to do martial arts and MMA (just sparring for fun). Used to play basketball and soccer back in school. I have an IQ of 165 (tested in 2nd grade). I rarely get sick and haven't even taken antibiotics in probably 15 years. Never broken a bone or had surgery. I tried to take care of myself so that I could be active with my kids and grandkids (when/if I have some). The last 10 years or so I can tell that my mind and memory isn't as sharp as it used to be. I couldn't run as fast or lift as much weight. My right leg and arm bother me. I just figured all the years of running, lifting, etc. had caught up with me. After all I'm 41. Now I wonder if most of the decline was due to MS. Part of me feels like what was the point in all that? I've only had one set of MRIs so they don't even know at what rate it's progressing. I don't like the uncertainty and having no control over anything. The neurologist said that he's very confident that in 30 years I'll be as good as I am now. There's always the chance that I'll decline. I just feel so powerless and overwhelmed. I miss my old life. 	1	1	Anyone|else|miss|the|life|they|used|to|have|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4696147201761882062/Weird-cognitive-effects?-I-can-remember-things-I-didnt-remember-before	Weird cognitive effects? (I can remember things I didn’t remember before)	I know this is really weird and google told me it wasn't something associated with MS - typically the other way around, but I swear I've been getting back memories from my childhood that I never remembered before. I've always had pretty bad memory, it was just one of those things about me, I have bad long term memory. So for about 4 months now I'll be having random moments in the day where these very vivid and specific memories from my childhood hit me and suddenly I can remember that exact day like it happened yesterday, when I never had the memory of before. I know it seems actually insane and I don't really get it, it's like reverse Alzheimer's. An example: I was sitting at work and suddenly remembered the full day of a ballet recital I had when I was about 6 years old (I'm 22 now) and it wasn't just oh yeah I remember doing ballet, I remember it like I lived it yesterday, I remember my mom doing my hair and getting me ready, the conversation we had in the car to the recital (I was talking about how I hated my teacher for yelling at me for being absent two days in a row) and I remember forgetting the whole dance, how my mom was trying to show me the moves from the side of the stage, etc. you get the point, I remembered the whole day. In specifics. I never remembered this before but now I perfectly remember it and know that it was something that actually occurred in my life. This has been happening randomly for about 4 months now, not every day but a few times a week I'll just get random memories that I swear I didn't remember before, and then I can suddenly walk myself through an entire day I never remembered. Then all of a sudden I have a new memory!! Its actually really cool and I've had fun just getting new little pieces of my life back that I forgot. I know that all sounds really weird, but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this? I was diagnosed in September 2018, I'm an avid runner and one day I woke up and my entire left leg was numb, I thought I pulled a muscle or something and am typically one to ignore injuries until they go away on their own. Then I lost all mobility of my left leg and long story short, I have MS. Thankfully I got mobility of my leg back and have been on Copaxone for about a month now. So far so good. Sorry to drone off but I figured a little back story to why I'm posting this in r/MultipleSclerosis Anyways, to anyone who actually reads this, I hope you have a nice day and that all is going well for you. :). 	1	1	Weird|cognitive|effects|?|(|I|can|remember|things|I|didn|’|t|remember|before|)	I|know|this|is|really|weird|and|google|told|me|it|wasn't|something|associated|with|MS|-|typically|the|other|way|around|,|but|I|swear|I've|been|getting|back|memories|from|my|childhood|that|I|never|remembered|before|.|I've|always|had|pretty|bad|memory|,|it|was|just|one|of|those|things|about|me|,|I|have|bad|long|term|memory|.|So|for|about|4|months|now|I'll|be|having|random|moments|in|the|day|where|these|very|vivid|and|specific|memories|from|my|childhood|hit|me|and|suddenly|I|can|remember|that|exact|day|like|it|happened|yesterday|,|when|I|never|had|the|memory|of|before|.|I|know|it|seems|actually|insane|and|I|don't|really|get|it|,|it's|like|reverse|Alzheimer's|.|An|example|:|I|was|sitting|at|work|and|suddenly|remembered|the|full|day|of|a|ballet|recital|I|had|when|I|was|about|6|years|old|(|I'm|22|now|)|and|it|wasn't|just|oh|yeah|I|remember|doing|ballet|,|I|remember|it|like|I|lived|it|yesterday|,|I|remember|my|mom|doing|my|hair|and|getting|me|ready|,|the|conversation|we|had|in|the|car|to|the|recital|(|I|was|talking|about|how|I|hated|my|teacher|for|yelling|at|me|for|being|absent|two|days|in|a|row|)|and|I|remember|forgetting|the|whole|dance|,|how|my|mom|was|trying|to|show|me|the|moves|from|the|side|of|the|stage|,|etc|.|you|get|the|point|,|I|remembered|the|whole|day|.|In|specifics|.|I|never|remembered|this|before|but|now|I|perfectly|remember|it|and|know|that|it|was|something|that|actually|occurred|in|my|life|.|This|has|been|happening|randomly|for|about|4|months|now|,|not|every|day|but|a|few|times|a|week|I'll|just|get|random|memories|that|I|swear|I|didn't|remember|before|,|and|then|I|can|suddenly|walk|myself|through|an|entire|day|I|never|remembered|.|Then|all|of|a|sudden|I|have|a|new|memory|!|!|Its|actually|really|cool|and|I've|had|fun|just|getting|new|little|pieces|of|my|life|back|that|I|forgot|.|I|know|that|all|sounds|really|weird|,|but|I|was|wondering|if|anyone|else|has|experienced|something|like|this|?|I|was|diagnosed|in|September|2018|,|I'm|an|avid|runner|and|one|day|I|woke|up|and|my|entire|left|leg|was|numb|,|I|thought|I|pulled|a|muscle|or|something|and|am|typically|one|to|ignore|injuries|until|they|go|away|on|their|own|.|Then|I|lost|all|mobility|of|my|left|leg|and|long|story|short|,|I|have|MS|.|Thankfully|I|got|mobility|of|my|leg|back|and|have|been|on|Copaxone|for|about|a|month|now|.|So|far|so|good|.|Sorry|to|drone|off|but|I|figured|a|little|back|story|to|why|I'm|posting|this|in|r|/|MultipleSclerosis|Anyways|,|to|anyone|who|actually|reads|this|,|I|hope|you|have|a|nice|day|and|that|all|is|going|well|for|you|.|:)|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4696088218989936007/Insurance-suggestions?-24MUSMN	Insurance suggestions? [24/M/USMN]	"So I'll clarify first that I'm insured under the state for at least another year with fair co pays depending on my income. My longtime fear though is turning 26 where the laws are no longer on my side. Combine that with MS where I need frequent visits, BW, MRI, and expensive medication and I'm terrified of the future tbh. I'm hoping to hear some opinions or ideas of those who have a grasp on this. I'll add that I'm self employed and plan on remaining that way for now so unfortunately employment healthcare isn't an option. I also can't afford hundreds monthly nor hundreds on co-pays, I'll need maximum coverage that is hopefully based on income. Currently with BCBS state and love it mostly but can I get state insurance post 26 with prior conditions without impossible deductions? I don't make a ton either like varied from 1200-2k but usually fall right above the state poverty line before taxes (13-14k in MN). I plan on moving to Portland OR in 5 years so if anyone has input from that area that helps too. Honestly I just want to stop freaking out about it. All my friends are like ""OMG student loans suck"" and while I agree I'm like ""if only student loans were my biggest worry."" Thoughts?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4696088218991058945/WeHealth,-PathMaker-Collaborating-to-Develop-MyoRegulator-as-Noninvasive-Treatment-for-Spasticity	WeHealth, PathMaker Collaborating to Develop MyoRegulator as Noninvasive Treatment for Spasticity	source: https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2019/01/11/wehealth-pathmaker-partner-myoregulator-spasticity/ JANUARY 11, 2019 BY ALICE MELÃO IN NEWS. WeHealth, PathMaker Collaborating to Develop MyoRegulator as Noninvasive Treatment for Spasticity WeHealth by Servier and PathMaker Neurosystems have established a new partnership to develop and commercialize the first neuromodulation technology for noninvasive treatment of spasticity, the companies announced. The agreement establishes an exclusive worldwide distribution arrangement, except for the U.S. and Japan, for PathMaker's MyoRegulator. The MyoRegulator uses two pairs of disposable skin-surface electrodes that deliver synchronized stimulation into two sites along the neural axis, at the spinal outflow and peripheral nerve controlling the affected muscle. This stimulatory approach is expected to modulate neural activity and suppress the excessive activity of spinal neurons that induce spasticity (uncontrolled muscle contraction), which is commonly seen in patients with neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and cerebral palsy. “We are excited by WeHealth's commitment to advancing next-generation treatments for chronic neuromotor conditions,” Nader Yaghoubi, MD, PhD, president and CEO of PathMaker, said in a press release. “This significant partnership will provide a large number of patients with access to this breakthrough non-invasive treatment through WeHealth's international presence in more than 100 countries worldwide.” “We look forward to the positive impact this partnership will have on the patients waiting for meaningful and safe treatment, and on the development of our company,” Yaghoubi added. Current pharmacological, surgical, and physical treatments available to manage spasticity can only achieve short-term positive results. But these strategies can be very uncomfortable for the patients, and are also associated with unpleasant adverse reactions. Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin, sold under the brand names Botox and Dysport, have been approved for the treatment of spasticity in the U.S. and other countries. However, according to PathMaker, this compound has been linked to muscular weakness, breathing difficulties, pneumonia, hypersensitivity, pain, and increased mortality. Working in collaboration with Northwell Health and the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, based in New York, PathMaker launched a clinical trial to test MyoRegulator in patients with hand spasticity after stroke (NCT03080454). Results of the trial, recently presented at the Society for Neuroscience meeting, revealed that patients experienced significant muscle function improvements upon five consecutive sessions of MyoRegulator-mediated stimulation. Optimal results were observed after two to three weeks of treatment on this regimen. “The MyoRegulator device has clear and groundbreaking benefits for patients with serious neurological conditions,” said David Guez, MD, general director of WeHealth by Servier, the e-health department of Servier Group. “Our partnership with PathMaker represents an opportunity for WeHealth to contribute to the advancement of a truly novel technology that is moving the field of bioelectronic medicine forward.” As part of the agreement, WeHealth will support an ongoing clinical trial underway at the Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle Epinière in France. The company will also fund a larger European clinical trial intended to support reimbursement coverage. 	1	0	WeHealth|,|PathMaker|Collaborating|to|Develop|MyoRegulator|as|Noninvasive|Treatment|for|Spasticity	source|:|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2019/01/11/wehealth-pathmaker-partner-myoregulator-spasticity/|JANUARY|11|,|2019|BY|ALICE|MELÃO|IN|NEWS|.|WeHealth|,|PathMaker|Collaborating|to|Develop|MyoRegulator|as|Noninvasive|Treatment|for|Spasticity|WeHealth|by|Servier|and|PathMaker|Neurosystems|have|established|a|new|partnership|to|develop|and|commercialize|the|first|neuromodulation|technology|for|noninvasive|treatment|of|spasticity|,|the|companies|announced|.|The|agreement|establishes|an|exclusive|worldwide|distribution|arrangement|,|except|for|the|U|.|S|.|and|Japan|,|for|PathMaker's|MyoRegulator|.|The|MyoRegulator|uses|two|pairs|of|disposable|skin-surface|electrodes|that|deliver|synchronized|stimulation|into|two|sites|along|the|neural|axis|,|at|the|spinal|outflow|and|peripheral|nerve|controlling|the|affected|muscle|.|This|stimulatory|approach|is|expected|to|modulate|neural|activity|and|suppress|the|excessive|activity|of|spinal|neurons|that|induce|spasticity|(|uncontrolled|muscle|contraction|)|,|which|is|commonly|seen|in|patients|with|neurological|disorders|such|as|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|and|cerebral|palsy|.|“|We|are|excited|by|WeHealth's|commitment|to|advancing|next-generation|treatments|for|chronic|neuromotor|conditions|,|”|Nader|Yaghoubi|,|MD|,|PhD|,|president|and|CEO|of|PathMaker|,|said|in|a|press|release|.|“|This|significant|partnership|will|provide|a|large|number|of|patients|with|access|to|this|breakthrough|non-invasive|treatment|through|WeHealth's|international|presence|in|more|than|100|countries|worldwide|.|”|“|We|look|forward|to|the|positive|impact|this|partnership|will|have|on|the|patients|waiting|for|meaningful|and|safe|treatment|,|and|on|the|development|of|our|company|,|”|Yaghoubi|added|.|Current|pharmacological|,|surgical|,|and|physical|treatments|available|to|manage|spasticity|can|only|achieve|short-term|positive|results|.|But|these|strategies|can|be|very|uncomfortable|for|the|patients|,|and|are|also|associated|with|unpleasant|adverse|reactions|.|Intramuscular|injections|of|botulinum|toxin|,|sold|under|the|brand|names|Botox|and|Dysport|,|have|been|approved|for|the|treatment|of|spasticity|in|the|U|.|S|.|and|other|countries|.|However|,|according|to|PathMaker|,|this|compound|has|been|linked|to|muscular|weakness|,|breathing|difficulties|,|pneumonia|,|hypersensitivity|,|pain|,|and|increased|mortality|.|Working|in|collaboration|with|Northwell|Health|and|the|Feinstein|Institute|for|Medical|Research|,|based|in|New|York|,|PathMaker|launched|a|clinical|trial|to|test|MyoRegulator|in|patients|with|hand|spasticity|after|stroke|(|NCT|03080454|)|.|Results|of|the|trial|,|recently|presented|at|the|Society|for|Neuroscience|meeting|,|revealed|that|patients|experienced|significant|muscle|function|improvements|upon|five|consecutive|sessions|of|MyoRegulator-mediated|stimulation|.|Optimal|results|were|observed|after|two|to|three|weeks|of|treatment|on|this|regimen|.|“|The|MyoRegulator|device|has|clear|and|groundbreaking|benefits|for|patients|with|serious|neurological|conditions|,|”|said|David|Guez|,|MD|,|general|director|of|WeHealth|by|Servier|,|the|e-health|department|of|Servier|Group|.|“|Our|partnership|with|PathMaker|represents|an|opportunity|for|WeHealth|to|contribute|to|the|advancement|of|a|truly|novel|technology|that|is|moving|the|field|of|bioelectronic|medicine|forward|.|”|As|part|of|the|agreement|,|WeHealth|will|support|an|ongoing|clinical|trial|underway|at|the|Institut|du|Cerveau|et|de|la|Moelle|Epinière|in|France|.|The|company|will|also|fund|a|larger|European|clinical|trial|intended|to|support|reimbursement|coverage|.
medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695852290707265653/Travelstanding-in-lines	Travel/standing in lines	So this is a combo rant/question...I'm on a work trip now, and as I stood in line for security and my legs were getting tired I was thinking more about this. It really varies how long my legs can handle standing up. Sometimes it's not too bad, other times I start hurting and they feel so weak fairly quickly. I get a little anxious then because I obviously don't have a chair around to sit down, and it's not exactly easy to sit on the floor in a security line (and then have to get back up when it moves!). I also have POTS, so if that is kicking in I can feel a bit light headed, but thankfully my meds are helping that much more than before I started them. It isn't always enough of a problem that I can't just suck it up so I'm often able to power through, but other times I wish I could just get through more quickly to be able to sit at my gate. I don't think I travel enough to ask for accommodations, and just like my parking pass I don't always need it and feel guilty/sometimes feel embarrassed using it. But then I think I'll be okay, then a few minutes later after walking around a bit I'm kicking myself for not using it. At a store I can just leave early, if I'm in a security line I can't exactly just go sit down... Has anyone gotten accommodations for getting through security more quickly/being able to do the faster lines? Do you have to go through a route with a doctor, or did you just pay to get the pre-check/whatever that is and keep the MS out of it entirely? Even if it's a faster line, sometimes my legs are just really having a bad day but there's still nowhere to sit, so are there accommodations for faster check in due to disability? And I sometimes think how helpful it would be to have a ride to my gate, but there's that whole pride issue again... and the stupidest thought, if I wanted to get food first, do you ask if they can bring you to the food place and then the gate?! God, that's such a stupid concern but I always wonder about that part, ha. I don't ask for assistance to get on the plane early either. I've stopped bringing my suitcase as a carry on because with my MS and also an ongoing arm issue (just stop it, body!) I can't handle that. I suppose that's something else to consider, do you have to say why you need help? Do you have to arrange for assistance ahead of time, or only if you had something like a walker? I know they can't ask questions, but if I look mobile enough and ask for that again, I'd feel embarrassed. I know I shouldn't care, but I do. Work usually pays for checking bags, but if I do personal travel it'd be nice to save money. That would really be the only assistance actually boarding the plane that I'd need. I know that's a lot of word vomit, so if anyone wants to share their airport travel tips that would be great! 	1	1	Travel|/|standing|in|lines	So|this|is|a|combo|rant|/|question|...|I'm|on|a|work|trip|now|,|and|as|I|stood|in|line|for|security|and|my|legs|were|getting|tired|I|was|thinking|more|about|this|.|It|really|varies|how|long|my|legs|can|handle|standing|up|.|Sometimes|it's|not|too|bad|,|other|times|I|start|hurting|and|they|feel|so|weak|fairly|quickly|.|I|get|a|little|anxious|then|because|I|obviously|don't|have|a|chair|around|to|sit|down|,|and|it's|not|exactly|easy|to|sit|on|the|floor|in|a|security|line|(|and|then|have|to|get|back|up|when|it|moves|!|)|.|I|also|have|POTS|,|so|if|that|is|kicking|in|I|can|feel|a|bit|light|headed|,|but|thankfully|my|meds|are|helping|that|much|more|than|before|I|started|them|.|It|isn't|always|enough|of|a|problem|that|I|can't|just|suck|it|up|so|I'm|often|able|to|power|through|,|but|other|times|I|wish|I|could|just|get|through|more|quickly|to|be|able|to|sit|at|my|gate|.|I|don't|think|I|travel|enough|to|ask|for|accommodations|,|and|just|like|my|parking|pass|I|don't|always|need|it|and|feel|guilty|/|sometimes|feel|embarrassed|using|it|.|But|then|I|think|I'll|be|okay|,|then|a|few|minutes|later|after|walking|around|a|bit|I'm|kicking|myself|for|not|using|it|.|At|a|store|I|can|just|leave|early|,|if|I'm|in|a|security|line|I|can't|exactly|just|go|sit|down|...|Has|anyone|gotten|accommodations|for|getting|through|security|more|quickly|/|being|able|to|do|the|faster|lines|?|Do|you|have|to|go|through|a|route|with|a|doctor|,|or|did|you|just|pay|to|get|the|pre-check|/|whatever|that|is|and|keep|the|MS|out|of|it|entirely|?|Even|if|it's|a|faster|line|,|sometimes|my|legs|are|just|really|having|a|bad|day|but|there's|still|nowhere|to|sit|,|so|are|there|accommodations|for|faster|check|in|due|to|disability|?|And|I|sometimes|think|how|helpful|it|would|be|to|have|a|ride|to|my|gate|,|but|there's|that|whole|pride|issue|again|...|and|the|stupidest|thought|,|if|I|wanted|to|get|food|first|,|do|you|ask|if|they|can|bring|you|to|the|food|place|and|then|the|gate|?|!|God|,|that's|such|a|stupid|concern|but|I|always|wonder|about|that|part|,|ha|.|I|don't|ask|for|assistance|to|get|on|the|plane|early|either|.|I've|stopped|bringing|my|suitcase|as|a|carry|on|because|with|my|MS|and|also|an|ongoing|arm|issue|(|just|stop|it|,|body|!|)|I|can't|handle|that|.|I|suppose|that's|something|else|to|consider|,|do|you|have|to|say|why|you|need|help|?|Do|you|have|to|arrange|for|assistance|ahead|of|time|,|or|only|if|you|had|something|like|a|walker|?|I|know|they|can't|ask|questions|,|but|if|I|look|mobile|enough|and|ask|for|that|again|,|I'd|feel|embarrassed|.|I|know|I|shouldn't|care|,|but|I|do|.|Work|usually|pays|for|checking|bags|,|but|if|I|do|personal|travel|it'd|be|nice|to|save|money|.|That|would|really|be|the|only|assistance|actually|boarding|the|plane|that|I'd|need|.|I|know|that's|a|lot|of|word|vomit|,|so|if|anyone|wants|to|share|their|airport|travel|tips|that|would|be|great|!

She has struggled with various symptoms for at least a few years now, but was always brushed off by doctors due to her issues with anxiety and depression (something tells me this is a common issue). She finally was able to see this neurologist who took her seriously and get some answers. I'm at a loss as to how to support her and I'm hoping this community can weigh in on it.

Supposedly is another avenue for researchers to explore RE MS, Alzheimers etc. source: https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2019/01/10/common-fungal-infection-impair-memory-mouse-study/ Common Fungal Infection Can Breach the Brain and Impair Memory, Mouse Study Shows JANUARY 10, 2019 BY PATRICIA INACIO, PHD IN NEWS. Blood infection with the yeast Candida albicans, a type of fungus, can reach the brain and trigger an immune response, a new mouse study shows. Although the fungus can be cleared within 10 days, it affects the spatial memory of mice. These findings are the first evidence that a blood infection with a fungus may have a role in diseases linked with a deregulated immune response in the central nervous system, like multiple sclerosis (MS). The study “Microglia and amyloid precursor protein coordinate control of transient Candida cerebritis with memory deficits” was published in the journal Nature Communications. Infections with the yeast Candida albicans have emerged as one of the leading blood infections in developed countries. “An increasing number of clinical observations by us and other groups indicates that fungi are becoming a more common cause of upper airway allergic diseases such as asthma, as well as other conditions such as sepsis, a potentially life-threatening disease caused by the body's response to an infection,” David B. Corry, MD, the study's senior author, said in a press release. Corry is professor of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Because the brain receives a large output of the blood pumped by the heart, it is susceptible to the effects of the blood-borne Candida albicans. For that to occur, however, the fungus has to cross the blood-brain barrier, a protective barrier that shields the central nervous system from the general blood circulation, including from pathogens that may damage the brain. Interestingly, fungal infections that cause airway allergic diseases and sepsis (a generalized infection spread throughout the body) have been linked with an increased risk of dementia. “These observations led us to investigate the possibility that fungus might produce a brain infection and, if so, the consequences of having that kind of infection,” said Corry, who also is a member of the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center. Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine developed a mouse model with low-grade C. albicans infection. With this model, they prevented the infection from causing severe disease — as high-grade fungus infection is lethal to mice — but could study the fungus' effects on brain function and the immune system. The team tested doses ranging from 2,500 to 50,000 yeast cells, and set the dose of 25,000 viable cells delivered in a single injection to mice. Using this animal model, researchers found that C. albicans fungi were able to cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain. “We thought that yeast would not enter the brain, but it does,” Corry said. Once in the brain, the infection induced a marked activation of microglia — immune cells of the central nervous system — including astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells. “In the brain, the yeast triggered the activity of microglia, a resident type of immune cell,” Corry said, which “became very active ‘eating and digesting' the yeast,” he added. Moreover, activated microglia released pro-inflammatory signals — interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factors (TNF) — and triggered the formation of fungal-induced glial granuloma (FIGG), a confined granule that trapped the yeast. “They [microglia] also produced a number of molecules that mediated an inflammatory response leading to the capture of the yeasts inside a granule-type structure inside the brain. We called it fungus-induced glial granuloma, or FIGG,” Corry said. To understand if the low-grade C. albicans infection had an effect on the brain's function, researchers tested the performance of C. albicans-infected mice in well-established rodent behavior tests. Compared to control mice (with no fungus infection), the animals infected with C. albicans showed impairments in a test that measured their spatial memory, called T-maze spontaneous alternation test. Moreover, as the infection was largely cleared by day 10, so did the impaired memory. However, microglia cells remained in an active state, and FIGG persisted until at least day 21. Overall, these findings highlight how a blood infection with a fungus can reach the brain and establish a successful infection. Moreover, once in the brain, the fungus triggered an immune response and, although the infection was resolved quickly, it triggered changes in certain functions within the brain, which supports a potential role for this type of infection in diseases like MS or Alzheimer's. In fact, accumulation of amyloid beta proteins (a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease) was found around fungus cells captured in FIGGs. “These findings suggest that the role fungi play in human illness potentially goes well beyond allergic airway disease or sepsis,” said Corry. “The results prompted us to consider the possibility that in some cases, fungi also could be involved in the development of chronic neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis. We are currently exploring this possibility,” Corry concluded. 	1	0	Common|Fungal|Infection|(|Candida|)|Can|Breach|the|Brain|and|Impair|Memory|,|Mouse|Study|Shows|.

For the last couple of weeks, my left eyelid is spasming. Now, I've had little transient eye twitches in the past now and again. I think almost everyone has! But this is the whole top lid. It twitches/spasms towards the inner corner of my eye. Sometimes it will happen over and over for a burst of time, about every three seconds or so.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695380432881105320/Need-to-vent-about-my-wife	Need to vent about my wife	"I just got diagnosed a few weeks ago. My wife and I have been married for 17 years and have 2 kids, 15 and 13. We've never had a ""great"" marriage. Lots of arguing, no sex or even touching, etc. She had a terrible mother that did a lot of emotional damage to her that she's not willing to work through or admit. Oh, and she's a nurse. So for my first neurologist meeting I invite my sister (she's a doctor), my wife lost her shit and we had several fights about it. My sister knows several neurologists nationally, some which are MS specialists, so she asked for their recommendations for medications. That pissed my wife off. My wife made a big deal about not telling our kids/family. Then I found out that she had already told all of our friends and family, apparently so that she could get attention. She thinks that I'm depressed and suicidal, which I'm not. She gets upset when I try to just talk about things I'm feeling or how I'm feeling and constantly says ""Can we just go a day without talking about MS?"" Even though I rarely talk to her about it. When I first got the diagnosis I felt like I was grieving for my old life, even though my life hasn't really been affected much. I haven't gotten sick in years and always been healthy. I thought that the things with my leg, heat and cold sensitivity, talking and swallowing issues, etc. were all because of something else and that they would get better. Now I know that they will always be there to a degree, or lurking under the surface ready to strike. I'll be taking medication, getting MRIs, going to the doctor more often, etc. It was a lot to deal with. I tried talking to her and she got annoyed and told me that I'm not dying. Right now MS really doesn't affect my daily life. I worry that if it does affect me that she won't be supportive at all even though she says she will. I don't think she would leave me because of how that would make her look to others. Sorry for the long post, I just needed to get that all out.

Would like to be able to skate gain....	39M with RRMS, diagnosed in 2004, copaxone, first 2 years, Rebif \~10years and presently Aubagio for just over a year. I had one big attack when I was 25 that severely affected my walking, gait, but I mostly recovered from that (thank you high does steroids and then participating a year long study taking mitoxantrone (chemo-light)). I had been playing hockey since I was 4 so I was pretty happy to be able to play beer league again about a year and a half after that treatment/recovery, but after a few years the drop foot making it too difficult and I had a take some time off. I am able to get around fairly well, work full time at a demanding job, married, kids, but I have some stiffness and gait issues, drop-foot, especially in my left leg that limit some of the sports I use to play. My oldest boy is now skating and will be in hockey in a year and I am getting a little anxious about having a hard time skating or playing hockey with him now. The drop-foot make it quite difficult to skate and I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience and if they had found some rehab or something that was effective in improving these issues. I know this seems like a pretty minor issue as far as MS-problems go, just wondering if anyone else has gone through/overcome similar issues  . 	1	1	Would|like|to|be|able|to|skate|gain|...	39M|with|RRMS|,|diagnosed|in|2004|,|copaxone|,|first|2|years|,|Rebif|\|~|10years|and|presently|Aubagio|for|just|over|a|year|.|I|had|one|big|attack|when|I|was|25|that|severely|affected|my|walking|,|gait|,|but|I|mostly|recovered|from|that|(|thank|you|high|does|steroids|and|then|participating|a|year|long|study|taking|mitoxantrone|(|chemo-light|)|)|.|I|had|been|playing|hockey|since|I|was|4|so|I|was|pretty|happy|to|be|able|to|play|beer|league|again|about|a|year|and|a|half|after|that|treatment|/|recovery|,|but|after|a|few|years|the|drop|foot|making|it|too|difficult|and|I|had|a|take|some|time|off|.|I|am|able|to|get|around|fairly|well|,|work|full|time|at|a|demanding|job|,|married|,|kids|,|but|I|have|some|stiffness|and|gait|issues|,|drop-foot|,|especially|in|my|left|leg|that|limit|some|of|the|sports|I|use|to|play|.|My|oldest|boy|is|now|skating|and|will|be|in|hockey|in|a|year|and|I|am|getting|a|little|anxious|about|having|a|hard|time|skating|or|playing|hockey|with|him|now|.|The|drop-foot|make|it|quite|difficult|to|skate|and|I|was|wondering|if|anyone|had|a|similar|experience|and|if|they|had|found|some|rehab|or|something|that|was|effective|in|improving|these|issues|.|I|know|this|seems|like|a|pretty|minor|issue|as|far|as|MS-problems|go|,|just|wondering|if|anyone|else|has|gone|through|/|overcome|similar|issues|.

She's in a medium-advanced stage already. She still functions, but with constant challenges. She isnt open about it with people. She doesn't tell people about it. She doesnt want people to worry, keep asking, or cut her slack, etc. She told a few close friends and family. Does anyone else relate to that? **EDIT (2018.01.11)** — thanks for your replies, everyone. First of all, i agree it is important to respect people's privacy. Whether they are private about a diagnosed condition, or what show they watch on netflix, you keep that secret. I was asking more about MS within that, is it something people typically keep to their close circle, or is it something people are open about. I really appreciate your responses, and even tho they differ in detail, they are all linked in their resolve. thanks! 	1	1	MS|Closet	Hello|everyone|.|My|partner|has|MS|,|diagnosed|just|over|a|year|ago|and|started|meds|just|a|few|months|back|.|She's|in|a|medium-advanced|stage|already|.|She|still|functions|,|but|with|constant|challenges|.|She|isnt|open|about|it|with|people|.|She|doesn't|tell|people|about|it|.|She|doesnt|want|people|to|worry|,|keep|asking|,|or|cut|her|slack|,|etc|.|She|told|a|few|close|friends|and|family|.|Does|anyone|else|relate|to|that|?|*|*|EDIT|(|2018.01|.|11|)|*|*|—|thanks|for|your|replies|,|everyone|.|First|of|all|,|i|agree|it|is|important|to|respect|people's|privacy|.|Whether|they|are|private|about|a|diagnosed|condition|,|or|what|show|they|watch|on|netflix|,|you|keep|that|secret|.|I|was|asking|more|about|MS|within|that|,|is|it|something|people|typically|keep|to|their|close|circle|,|or|is|it|something|people|are|open|about|.|I|really|appreciate|your|responses|,|and|even|tho|they|differ|in|detail|,|they|are|all|linked|in|their|resolve|.|thanks|!

My family has been pressuring me for years to get tested and I think its time. My mother was diagnosed 28 years ago when I was born. For the past 6 months, I've been suffering from intense itching all over and after many allergy/blood tests no derms can figure it out. I just started Gabapentin and hope it helps. As a result of the nonstop itching & my inability to sleep, my anxiety / panic attacks have been through the roof, I am severely depressed and fatigued but found out I have a very low vitamin D level so I will begin a supplement soon which hopefully helps. I am not convinced I have MS, but since its genetic I think its worth finding out…. . I have Aetna and have looked on my insurance website for neurologists (the one my mother sees doesn't take insurance at all) but there are a lot of different options and I'm unsure (I live in Brooklyn, so open to anywhere in NYC area really) I thought it might be worth asking here if anyone knows of any doctors they can recommend.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4695085523081221785/Top-5-Questions-I-get-when-asked-about-MS.	Top 5 Questions I get when asked about MS.	First a bit about me to explain this first posting to the group. I have been living with MS for over 10 years and from the first time I was diagnosed I have done my best to stay positive. I am not turning this into a rant but instead thought I'd share one of the several posts to my blog about the disease. This is in regards to the most common questions I get asked about MS when I tell people I have the disease. No I won't plug my blog in this post as this is not a bate to get you to check it out. Instead I hope that people find the post interesting and maybe some will find it informative.   I'm one of those people who is not afraid to take time to talk to someone about the beast that is now part of my life. The beast is nothing that is seen upon my body. You do not see a creature hiding behind me, on my shoulders or hugging my leg. Granted at times it does feel like it is hugging both legs and even my arms. The beast is called Multiple Sclerosis. I have blogged in the past about it and it is something I do plan on continuing to post new blog posts on in the future. I made it easy for people to find my older posts with a category titled Multiple Sclerosis. This post is going to go into what I consider the five most frequent questions I get when I tell people I have MS. I will warn readers that I use humor, sarcasm and at same time I can be serious. You will find that within this posting and hopefully it opens your eyes to what some, not all may go thru with MS. I know from my point of view this is what I go thru. You are as always welcome to share this post if you so wish.   1. [**What is Multiple Sclerosis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis)**?** I always am tempted to go with the medical explanation of how immune system will attack the Myelin around nerve cells, and blah blah blah. I can just picture the glass eyed look of how I could lose someone going into that so I often explain it in this way. “MS is like your computer, brain, giving orders to your body telling it how to do everything from breathing to walking. It controls so much of our body and many of those orders go thru the nerves. Sadly MS is like when somehow, and unknown, those commands don't fully work. It causes all types of computer issues when you get a virus, and MS can cause all types of problems with the body. Sadly it's not a virus it's something science hasn't figured out yet.”   1. **Did they give you a time frame on life?** This one gets me to laugh a bit. I say that as really there is no expectation on when you'll die due to MS, if it is even the cause of your death. I mean if you think on it the moment we are born we start by taking a big breath into this world. Every single breath after that first one could be our last. So, we have to stop worrying about when it may end but instead worry how we spend that time. Do we worry about things we cannot control? Do we let a disease dictate our life expectancy? I say NO, as for me it's a ride and I hope to enjoy it, stay within the law, and hopefully leave a mark of positivity. If I'm remembered for anything I just want it to be that I cared, I listened and I tried to help if I could.   1. **Do I get depressed, or was I depressed?** You know, I think those I first told about the diagnosis where more depressed, and unsure what to do then I was. To me it was a part of life, and I was not going to let it change who I was on the inside. This comes from a battle of depression in my early college years. I learned so much about myself and add in psychology course I took I learned to let things go. Sure I can get upset at times, who doesn't. The main difference is I at least have learned what to do to overcome. The biggest thing about depression, in my opinion, is not to run from someone looking to talk. Do not judge them, the best thing we can do is just listen. Let them express their emotions, the suffering that has put them in that bad place. Let them give you hints on how you may be able to help instead of just saying they need to do this or that. The biggest step for someone with Depression is the fact they talked about it.   1. **What are some of the symptoms of MS?** This is one that is hard to answer. You see we have heard that life is like a box of chocolates as we never know what we'll get. MS, to me, is a chocolate store. I say that as there are various versions of the disease and each has its own symptoms that can impact a person totally different then the next person. Me I had severe nerve pain and muscle pain in my arms and legs. My arms would suddenly start contracting in on themselves and was very painful. I got to a doctor and after many tests the diagnosis came back. I still have some of the common issues that come with MS.   * I get pain at times in both my arms and legs. * Some refer to this as the MS Hug as you get a sense someone is hugging you deeply and won't let go. * I also get a tingle feeling in the arms and legs. * Fatigue is the worst one to me. You get tired and really you can't fight it. * I think of it as if you stayed up for over 24 hours and body is demanding sleep. No matter how much caffeine you may take to stay awake the fatigue is going to claim you. * Vision Issues * I have had a small loss of vision within in my left eye. I can see out of it but imagine looking thru a piece of paper with tons of little holes punched in it. There will be spots you can't see and that's my left eye. * Concentration Issues * This doesn't happen all the time, or too often. I believe this is why I am one who enjoys the challenge of multitasking. It helps me bounce from project to project and back again. It can be a pain though and when it's bad, well that's what a “To Do” list is for. * Others * There are a few other things like I'll get some numbness in my right leg/foot at times. It's nothing to major but it does happen from time to time. * Emotions can be impacted as I have found I tear up while watching a movie for no reason. It maybe something I've seen for years but boom it happens. * Bowels, well I won't go too much into this one as don't want people running away going…. ..”EWWWW”. I'll just say that when I have to go to the bathroom, sometimes it's important I get there. Thankfully I have not had to buy a lot of new underwear or pants. HA HA   1. **Anything I can do to help?** I do like this question but I got to say it's the hardest to answer.   * I mean those who ask I'd love to tell them sure, take this thing from me. However, I know they cannot and to be honest would not wish it on them. * I'd like to go sure, got some money I can have? I mean before I got good insurance bills hit hard. Those I have joked with about that will say set up a Go Fund Me page or something. I just can't do that, I think it's my pride and well I keep finding a way to make sure bills, and mortgage are covered. Granted got to say at times……. .well…. ..yeah. (Insert a smile here ha ha) * What can they really do most is do not feel sorry for me. I try to lead by example. I do not want someone feeling sorry as its life. As I mentioned before I am still taking a new breath and my time has not come. We live in a world of challenges and do not let the petty and stupid guide your life. Agree to disagree and continue being a friend. Agree to know what topics may be off topic and leave them out of conversation. Most of all understand I never been one to really put myself out there. In truth this blog is my way to do that, and I know I've lost many of friends in my life due to this part of myself. I'll add that MS is like many other diseases in the world. It does not matter who you are, where you are from it will impact people of all kinds. Some are more than willing to talk about MS, and others treat it like depression and hide the diagnosis. I personally do not care how one deals with the diagnosis as long as they DO NOT GIVE UP. I'll end this very long post with the one quote I often say to people. ***“I may have Multiple Sclerosis but is DOES NOT HAVE ME!”***. 	1	1	Top|5|Questions|I|get|when|asked|about|MS|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694723999378957288/Someone-tell-me-what's-left-to-live-for-after-reading-this-post	Someone tell me what's left to live for after reading this post	Today I learned that I'm fucking ugly. Never mind the fact that I have a progressive illness that makes me undesirable to virtually everyone, I am extremely unpleasant to look at. I'm 21, so I was supposed to have my entire life ahead of me, but the fact is that I am extremely unpleasant to look at (MS aside). I downloaded tinder and bumble and have recieved 0 matches while some of my good friends have in excess of 30. When I posted to see how I could improve my tinder/bumble, here's what I got >In your verification pic, you really look like a butch lesbian. As for the gallery. In the first picture you look like a shifty character. In the second picture it looks like your entire face is slanted to your right. Even your nose and smile are curved like a permanent troll face. It also reminds me a lot of Hide The Pain Harold. So far you're a 3/10. You aren't disgusting to look at, but not attractive either. Some things you can improve are to get your nose corrected and straight. Maybe find out why your jaw is out of alignment as well. Definitely need a better haircut in all your pictures. >The outlook is not good, even if you put in a lot of effort. I typically don't use subs like that, but I was becoming desperate because my family and friends only tell me what I want to hear, not the truth I need to hear. So, it would be somewhat more bearable if I were semi attractive with MS, but that's not the case. I am just about done. Depression meds have done fuck all for me, and I have unfortunately began a habit of cutting myself (but only with my nails). I can thank my dad for my ugliness and my mom for the MS. 	1	1	Someone|tell|me|what's|left|to|live|for|after|reading|this|post	Today|I|learned|that|I'm|fucking|ugly|.|Never|mind|the|fact|that|I|have|a|progressive|illness|that|makes|me|undesirable|to|virtually|everyone|,|I|am|extremely|unpleasant|to|look|at|.|I'm|21|,|so|I|was|supposed|to|have|my|entire|life|ahead|of|me|,|but|the|fact|is|that|I|am|extremely|unpleasant|to|look|at|(|MS|aside|)|.|I|downloaded|tinder|and|bumble|and|have|recieved|0|matches|while|some|of|my|good|friends|have|in|excess|of|30|.|When|I|posted|to|see|how|I|could|improve|my|tinder|/|bumble|,|here's|what|I|got|>|In|your|verification|pic|,|you|really|look|like|a|butch|lesbian|.|As|for|the|gallery|.|In|the|first|picture|you|look|like|a|shifty|character|.|In|the|second|picture|it|looks|like|your|entire|face|is|slanted|to|your|right|.|Even|your|nose|and|smile|are|curved|like|a|permanent|troll|face|.|It|also|reminds|me|a|lot|of|Hide|The|Pain|Harold|.|So|far|you're|a|3/10|.|You|aren't|disgusting|to|look|at|,|but|not|attractive|either|.|Some|things|you|can|improve|are|to|get|your|nose|corrected|and|straight|.|Maybe|find|out|why|your|jaw|is|out|of|alignment|as|well|.|Definitely|need|a|better|haircut|in|all|your|pictures|.|>|The|outlook|is|not|good|,|even|if|you|put|in|a|lot|of|effort|.|I|typically|don't|use|subs|like|that|,|but|I|was|becoming|desperate|because|my|family|and|friends|only|tell|me|what|I|want|to|hear|,|not|the|truth|I|need|to|hear|.|So|,|it|would|be|somewhat|more|bearable|if|I|were|semi|attractive|with|MS|,|but|that's|not|the|case|.|I|am|just|about|done|.|Depression|meds|have|done|fuck|all|for|me|,|and|I|have|unfortunately|began|a|habit|of|cutting|myself|(|but|only|with|my|nails|)|.|I|can|thank|my|dad|for|my|ugliness|and|my|mom|for|the|MS|.

I have been on Tysabri since March 2018 (about 10 months). I live in South America, however I will be moving to the US in a couple of weeks and was hoping you guys could help me out with some questions I have about continuing the treament there. Me and my doctor planned for me to keep Tysabri for the standard time, 2 years, so that means I would continue taking Tysabri infusions moving to the US. However healthcare there is very different from here, and honestly a bit difficult to understand even after doing research. - What do I need to keep in mind when getting health insurance in the US? - I believe I will be getting a PPO type from my husband's job, but in regards to MS treatments, especially Tysabri, is there anything I should pay attention to if I need to get another insurance? - Do all plans cover MS treatments? As a co-payment or co-participation? Or does it vary per plan? - Do I need to buy Tysabri separately and then schedule the infusion at an infusion center, or do they already have Tysabri available on site? Sorry for so many questions, I'm just very anxious about moving and I like to have everything planned as best as possible! I did some research but like I said it's all very confusing. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! 	1	1	Tysabri|Treatment|in|the|US|-|How|does|it|work|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694606034858228824/Neuropsychologists	Neuropsychologists	Hi guys, I was wondering if anyone here had any experience with seeing a neuropsychologist. I am currently debating whether to see someone. I have done therapy before, before I got diagnosed, but found that after my diagnosis that seeing a general therapist can only help so far with that. I found a neuropsychologist who has a lot of experience and very good references. However, she charges quite a lot of money (and she doesn't do insurance) - £210 for an initial assessment of 90 minutes and £140 for every one-hour session afterwards. I am aware that she has the qualifications etc. but this seems like an awful lot of money.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4694488068564645562/28M---What-to-expect?	28M - What to expect?	Hey r/multiplesclerosis, I have not yet been diagnosed with MS or any other neurological disorder and I am not seeking a diagnosis here. About two weeks ago, my left ear and sometimes part of the left side of my face (immediately surrounding my ear, my temple, and part of my cheek) began going numb intermittently and seemingly randomly. At times, it's more of a tingling feeling crawling over/around the area. It feels odd, but there's no pain and my hearing hasn't been affected. I planned to see an ENT, but my uncle, who's an MD, suggested consulting a neurologist given the symptoms. The neurologist did a full workup (physical exam, including testing reflexes, senses, balance and motor skills, and a whole bunch of blood work). He also scheduled a brain MRI for this Thursday and a follow-up visit with him this Friday and said we'd go from there. Since then, things have stayed basically the same. However, the day after the appointment, my left ankle and foot began to feel somewhat numb and tingly (not completely - more like walking on a pillow) - also intermittently and seemingly randomly. I have been incredibly fortunate in that I have had no major health issues and have never had to interact with doctors or hospitals in any significant way. What should I expect with regards to the MRI? Any tips? Should I record symptoms each day or is that overthinking things? Thanks in advance - I appreciate any advice. 	1	0	28M|-|What|to|expect|?

It's not like muffled hearing due to fluid in the ear. I noticed that sometimes I will feel a slight squeeze around my head when this happens. I sometimes get very bad vertigo with it.

My last Neuro (who was progressive as she's a star in the MS research world) told me to have blood work for my hormone levels. We had a discussion, I don't remember what she said for women but I specifically remember her saying that for men research has found that testosterone and DHT were neuroprotective and as those levels decline in age, men MS gets worse. She mentioned something about women being relapse free during pregnancy due to a hormone that protects them (I don't remember which hormone it was for women). She left to the USA and I have a new neuro that I want to discuss my results with. Before I see him has anyone been offered hormone therapy for declining hormones ? Have any men here gone on testosterone therapy (obviously I can't do that because I am female) on the behest of their neuro? Anyone else hear this or is she the minority?

She is going to be 3yo in March. My husband and I go back and forth on whether or not to have another child. We want one but are hesitant with me having MS. My Neuro said I've mostly likely had MS for about a decade which means even during my first pregnancy I had MS. She also said that me having a severe relapse post partum is not uncommon and many women are diagnosed that way. The entire first year after my diagnosis was terrible. I could barely see or walk for nearly 4 months, I had servere depression and still struggle with anxiety. I have adjusted. I have been to counseling. I have learned to healthily cope. I'll be 30 in May. I feel like I'll regret not having a second child. I don't want MS to ever control my life but with that said I am still terrified! The unknowns are the worst-but everyone, MS or not, have unknowns in their life. TLDR: I want to have a second child but I'm afraid because of my MS. I just wanted to say it outloud to someone who may understand. Thanks for reading. 	1	1	To|have|a|baby|or|not|have|a|baby|...

(NASDAQ: BIIB) announced. Currently commercialized under the brand name TYSABRI®, natalizumab 300 mg dosed every four weeks is the only approved dosing regimen. The new study, NOVA (NCT03689972), is a two-year, prospective, randomized, interventional, controlled, open-label, rater-blinded, international Phase 3b study that will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of six-week natalizumab dosing intervals in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Patients who switch to EID after one year of treatment with natalizumab SID will be evaluated in relation to patients receiving continued SID treatment. The study will enroll approximately 480 patients worldwide. The primary endpoint is the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions at week 48. “For more than a decade, natalizumab has been considered a highly effective treatment option for patients with relapsing forms of MS,” said Alfred Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer at Biogen. “The NOVA study may generate valuable data that we hope will answer questions for the scientific community about the efficacy of natalizumab when its dosing schedule is extended to every six weeks, and in conjunction with prior safety analyses, may inform on the drug's benefit-risk profile.” NOVA was initiated following analyses that showed that EID was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but serious brain infection. The pre-specified, retrospective analysis of the U.S. TOUCH (TYSABRI® Outreach: United Commitment to Health) REMS program examined the impact of EID as compared to SID on the risk of PML, and the NOVA study aims to assess the efficacy of EID natalizumab to further evaluate the drug's benefit-risk profile. 	1	0	Biogen|(|BIIB|)|Reports|First|Patient|Enrollment|in|Phase|3b|Study|to|Evaluate|Extended|Interval|Dosing|with|Natalizumab|(|Tysabri|)|in|Multiple|Sclerosis	I|thought|people|were|doing|extended|interval|dosing|already|-|I|remember|sharing|[|this|article|]|(|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/02/09/ms-update-good-news-for-tysabri-users-who-are-jcv-positive/|)|and|was|planning|on|doing|it|myself|if|I|switch|to|Tysabri|...|I|guess|this|is|the|first|time|Biogen|is|actually|doing|a|study|on|it|.|source|:|https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Biogen+%28BIIB%29+Reports+First+Patient+Enrollment+in+Phase+3b+Study+to+Evaluate+Extended+Interval+Dosing+with+Natalizumab+in+Multiple+Sclerosis/14968108.html|Biogen|(|BIIB|)|Reports|First|Patient|Enrollment|in|Phase|3b|Study|to|Evaluate|Extended|Interval|Dosing|with|Natalizumab|in|Multiple|Sclerosis|January|3|,|2019|7:31|AM|EST|The|first|patient|has|been|enrolled|in|a|global|Phase|3b|study|evaluating|the|efficacy|and|safety|of|extended|interval|dosing|(|EID|;|every|six|weeks|)|for|natalizumab|compared|to|standard|interval|dosing|(|SID|)|in|patients|with|relapsing|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|,|Biogen|Inc|.|(|NASDAQ|:|BIIB|)|announced|.|Currently|commercialized|under|the|brand|name|TYSABRI|®|,|natalizumab|300|mg|dosed|every|four|weeks|is|the|only|approved|dosing|regimen|.|The|new|study|,|NOVA|(|NCT|03689972|)|,|is|a|two-year|,|prospective|,|randomized|,|interventional|,|controlled|,|open-label|,|rater-blinded|,|international|Phase|3b|study|that|will|assess|the|efficacy|,|safety|and|tolerability|of|six-week|natalizumab|dosing|intervals|in|people|with|relapsing-remitting|MS|.|Patients|who|switch|to|EID|after|one|year|of|treatment|with|natalizumab|SID|will|be|evaluated|in|relation|to|patients|receiving|continued|SID|treatment|.|The|study|will|enroll|approximately|480|patients|worldwide|.|The|primary|endpoint|is|the|number|of|new|or|newly|enlarging|T2|hyperintense|lesions|at|week|48|.|“|For|more|than|a|decade|,|natalizumab|has|been|considered|a|highly|effective|treatment|option|for|patients|with|relapsing|forms|of|MS|,|”|said|Alfred|Sandrock|,|Jr|.|,|M|.|D|.|,|Ph|.|D|.|,|executive|vice|president|and|chief|medical|officer|at|Biogen|.|“|The|NOVA|study|may|generate|valuable|data|that|we|hope|will|answer|questions|for|the|scientific|community|about|the|efficacy|of|natalizumab|when|its|dosing|schedule|is|extended|to|every|six|weeks|,|and|in|conjunction|with|prior|safety|analyses|,|may|inform|on|the|drug's|benefit-risk|profile|.|”|NOVA|was|initiated|following|analyses|that|showed|that|EID|was|associated|with|a|significant|reduction|in|the|risk|of|progressive|multifocal|leukoencephalopathy|(|PML|)|,|a|rare|but|serious|brain|infection|.|The|pre-specified|,|retrospective|analysis|of|the|U|.|S|.|TOUCH|(|TYSABRI|®|Outreach|:|United|Commitment|to|Health|)|REMS|program|examined|the|impact|of|EID|as|compared|to|SID|on|the|risk|of|PML|,|and|the|NOVA|study|aims|to|assess|the|efficacy|of|EID|natalizumab|to|further|evaluate|the|drug's|benefit-risk|profile|.

Researchers at the University of Toronto and UC San Francisco have discovered that the intestine is the source of immune cells that reduce brain inflammation in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), and that increasing the number of these cells blocks inflammation entirely in a preclinical MS model.	"source: https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-01-gut-immune-cells-inflammation-multiple.html Gut immune cells cut inflammation in multiple sclerosis January 3, 2019, University of Toronto Researchers at the University of Toronto and UC San Francisco have discovered that the intestine is the source of immune cells that reduce brain inflammation in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), and that increasing the number of these cells blocks inflammation entirely in a preclinical model of the disease. The cells in question are plasma cells—white blood cells that originate as B cells in the bone marrow but change their behavior when triggered by microbes in the gut. Studying mice and samples from human MS patients, the researchers found that plasma cells that reside in the gut and produce Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies appear to migrate to the central nervous system and produce an anti-inflammatory effect during MS flare-ups. MS is an autoimmune disease, driven by other types of immune cells (including B and T cells) that attack myelin, the protective coating that surrounds nerve fibers. Recent clinical studies have shown drugs that target B cells mitigate MS, while those that target plasma cells make the disease worse. The current study offers an explanation for these divergent results. ""We already knew what was and was not working in the clinic,"" says Jen Gommerman, Ph.D., a professor of immunology at the University of Toronto and the senior author on the study. ""But here we've uncovered the molecular and cellular mechanism at play. It's a kind of reverse translation approach, which highlights the importance of the gut-brain axis in MS and other autoimmune conditions."" The results were published online January 3, 2019 in Cell. Canada and the U.S. have among the highest rates of MS in the world, with around three in every thousand individuals affected. Symptoms can include fatigue, poor coordination, tingling, organ problems and cognitive impairment. There is no cure, although quicker diagnoses and better drugs have improved outcomes significantly in the last 15 years. ""IgAs comprise 80 per cent of all antibodies in the body, yet their exact function is still not fully understood,"" says Sergio Baranzini, Ph.D., a co-author on the paper who is a professor of neurology in the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences. ""Showing that IgA-producing B cells can travel from the gut to the brain opens a new page in the book of neuroinflammatory diseases and could be the first step towards producing novel treatments to modulate or stop MS and related neurological disorders."" The lead authors on the work are postdoctoral fellows Olga Rojas, Ph.D., and Elisa Porfilio, Ph.D., from the Gommerman lab at the University of Toronto and Anne-Katrin Pröbstel, MD, from the Baranzini lab at UCSF. In a moment of scientific serendipity, they recently presented their research at the same conference and realized their results aligned. The researchers began to collaborate, and Pröbstel and colleagues in the Baranzini lab were able to show that the Gommerman lab's findings in mice had parallels to human MS patients. Specifically, the UCSF team found evidence that IgA was decreased in fecal samples from patients with active MS neuroinflammation, suggesting that the inflammation-suppressing cells had been recruited to help fight the patients' disease. One promising aspect of the new research is that increasing the number of IgA plasma cells that migrate from the gut to the brain eradicated neuroinflammation in mice. A therapeutic approach might aim to expand the number of these cells in the gut, enabling a plentiful supply that could move to the brain and dampen inflammation. ""As a clinician-scientist, it is exciting that our experiments linking preclinical animal models to the biology we see in real MS patients may have uncovered a general mechanism for how the immune system counteracts inflammation,"" said UCSF's Pröbstel. ""Until now, no one has really studied these IgA-producing plasma cells in the context of disease, but we are now examining them in detail in patients with MS to begin to understand how we might manipulate them to help treat neuroinflammatory disease."" A key next step for the researchers is to figure out what microbes in the gut promote the generation of immunosuppressive IgA plasma cells. ""If we can understand what these cells are reacting to, we can potentially treat MS by modulating our gut commensals,"" says Gommerman, referring to the bacteria that live in the healthy gut. ""That might be easier than getting drugs into the brain, which is a strategy that hasn't always worked in MS."" The study also raises questions about the microbiome and lifestyle choices. Do certain lifestyles nudge some people toward a gut microbiome that allows immunosuppressive plasma cells to flourish? Are specific foods conducive to creating that environment and if so, might a drug or supplement mimic the effect? Genetics are just one factor that affect susceptibility to MS; the current study highlights how non-genetic factors may confer disease resistance. Gommerman plans to pursue the basic science behind these questions, working with Baranzini and other research groups to bring the findings into the clinical realm. ""There is something very critical about how the gut and brain are connected, and we're starting to unravel the molecular threads behind that clinical observation,"" she says. ""It's a great example of how fast science can move.""

She has had multiple instances of UTI related sepsis in the past 7 years. Her most recent bout sent her in on Christmas. She didn't respond to antibiotics after the first two days and her kidney values were very bad. Her doctor orderd an abdominal CT and found that both kidneys have multiple large stones. Her right one had one partially in the ureter. She had to have a nephrostomy tube placed. She seemed to be inproving and had been down graded from ICU to progressive to general care. But when my dad and I were visiting last night we discovered that she had no vision in her right eye and has developed a difficulty swallowing. Both symptoms showed up within the past two days. She is non-verbal but will shake or nod her head. They don't know if she had a stroke or if this is MS related. They took her for an MRI and I don't know when they will bring her back.

Transcranial Stimulation at Home Reduces MS Fatigue. National MS Society will fund a large randomized clinical trial of RS-tDCS for fatigue.	"source: https://www.mdmag.com/medical-news/transcranial-stimulation-at-home-reduces-fatigue-multiple-sclerosis Transcranial Stimulation at Home Reduces Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis JANUARY 03, 2019 Kenneth Bender, PharmD, MA A randomized, sham-controlled trial demonstrated that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) reduced fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS). Additionally, the remotely supervised system enabled patients to achieve a cumulative effect from repeated administration without leaving home. ""We have learned that, even in our urban environment, daily visits to the clinic are just not feasible for most patients,"" lead study author, Leigh Charvet, PhD, director of MS Research, Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center and associate professor of neurology, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, New York, told MD Magazine®. ""Our remotely supervised, or 'RS-'tDCS, is very different from self-direct use since it instead uses a telemedicine platform where we have 1 of our team members live with the tDCS recipient for the entire session via videoconference,"" Charvet said. There have been small, preliminary trials of tDCS with different electrode placements for this most common of MS symptoms. Charvet and colleagues described 1 recent trial with anode placement over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which appeared to exert the most fatigue-specific improvements in multiple sclerosis. They have also cited other tDCS studies with DLPFC placement, which have shown favorable results for fatigue in post-polio syndrome and Parkinson's disease. In the study, the team utilized a fully programmable tDCS device, which was customized for remote sessions, with the capacity to retain data from all sessions. There was a large button keypad for easy use and safety functions, such as an automatic abort feature if the electrode contact was lost. The headset was optimized for placement of 5x52 cm sponge electrodes over the DLPFC. Active sessions were conducted with 1.5 to 2.0mÅ over 20 minutes, and the sham control applied that stimulation in only the first and last minute of the session. ""Just as with medication studies, the potential for a placebo effect is very important to capture as it can be especially powerful when measuring symptoms, such as fatigue,"" Charvet explained. ""In tDCS, we use a sham condition, which most patients can't distinguish from the active stimulation."" The investigators reported on 2 trials, which included the randomized, sham-controlled trial of the RS-tDCS administered in 20 sessions over 4 weeks and a smaller, open label trial that compared the effects of 10 sessions over 2 weeks to a cognitive-training-only condition. For each trial, participants with a multiple sclerosis diagnosis of any subtype were recruited without screening for the presence of fatigue. The investigators noted that such screening was unnecessary as 75% or more of patients with MS report fatigue as their most disabling problems. Patients for both studies received neurological examination, including assessment with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) prior to screening. Exclusion criteria included history of brain trauma, seizures or uncontrolled migraine headaches, or having received steroid treatment or clinical relapse within 30 days. Candidates were also excluded for a z score of ≤3 on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), reflecting insufficient competence. Those with an EDSS score greater than 6.5, corresponding to upper extremity deficits that would interfere with operating the device, could participate with a healthcare proxy, such as a spouse caregiver to provide assistance. The primary outcome was change in fatigue from baseline to treatment end as measured with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-fatigue short form. A secondary outcome was change in the participant's visual analog scale scoring of fatigue (0=no fatigue, 10=severe, worst fatigue) before and after each tDCS session, which was entered onto a provided laptop computer. Although there was only modest fatigue reduction in the active group of the open trial (n=15), the sham-controlled trial demonstrated statistically and significantly greater reduction for that active group (n=15). The investigators attributed the greater benefit in the longer trial to both the cumulative effect from higher number of sessions and a greater acute effect reflected in daily reported fatigue level. They were also pleased to report on the utility of the devices in the homes of the trial participants as well as prospects for additional and larger investigations. ""We are really excited to start enrollment in a large randomized clinical trial of RS-tDCS for fatigue in MS funded by the National MS Society,"" Charvet announced.

So I was diagnosed with ppms, and started seeing a urologist about urine retention. They scheduled me for urodynamics, and the pain of the catheter was so bad that even over a year later, I still sit up some nights thinking about it. I will never allow that to happen to me again, I don't know if it's normal or whatever but it was certainly traumatic for me. Now my urologist is insisting that I can either start cathing myself or have a bag attached to my side. I'm on tamsulosin right now but it doesn't help much and I was wondering if anyone has had any similar experiences or recommendations of where I can go from here. Thanks!

I work a job where I am on my feet for 9+ hours with no issues other than my feet hurting more than what I'm use to. I am not here for a diagnosis just to get some advice. I had an MRI when I was 13 years old and it was clean but that was 7 years ago. I don't have health insurance but I'm starting to get a little worried. Do you think this is in my head and I'm okay? Do you recommend making an appointment with a doctor? I don't know what to do. Sorry this post is a little scattered. Thanks in advance. 	1	0	Worried|about|possibly|having|MS|.

"So due to what my neurologist called a ""moderate"" flare episode (foot drop, grip weakness and tinglyness/numbness on one side), I had my first ever brain/spineMRI and spinal tap plus a plethora of bloodwork areound Thanksgiving and got myself an MS diagnosis. In that MRI they mentioned multiple (more than 10) lesions, many enhancing some not. Had a round of steroids, symptoms cleared up, and I started taking about DMTs with my neurologist who has been super great. About 2 weeks later, I got new symptoms (double vision, tingly/numbness on the other side) and a second round of steroids to clear those up. I had a follow-up brain MRI on New year's after finishing the steroids before starting on Tecfidera. Just got those MRI results back and I have multiple new enhancing lesions (~8) compared to ~ month ago, while some of the original one are no longer enhancing and some have shrunk. The Dr. said the new ones means things are still active and may flare-up again until the pills kick in. Not sure how long that will take. Luckily the steroids seem to have helped 99% of my symptoms and I just started the pills yesterday, so I'm hoping things don't flare up again soon. It it normal for lesions to appear so quickly and for so many to show up in a month? Just curious if I should be concerned and what others experiences are.

I think I maybe over did the walking this New Years and made myself tired. So today I am resting the knee. Not over working it. I hope that the feeling of being able to walk doesn't go away. It is absolutely amazing what this has done so far though. My sugar is spiking like no tomorrow because of it affecting my levels but it will be normal in a few days. My BPM have been 61 which is normal for me so it has not affected my heart so far. We can make this a free for all for questions if any of you have questions about this Acthar Gel.

Hi folks,   I was finally diagnosed last month after a 2 year back-and-forth after getting to an MS specialist and the discovery of 4/5 additional lesions. After conferring with my doctor, we decided on Tecfidera. I've been told that it comes with some stomach discomfort and flushing, as well as the minor chance of the brain infection, but wanted to get your opinions on how Tecfidera has worked for you and side effects you've experienced. In talking with some friends of friends who have MS (no one I know directly is a member of our fun little group), I've heard varying stories of how bad the flushing and stomach issues can be, though my doctor downplayed those a bit. Either way, I'm planning on trying it out for a few months before I consider trying another option if it isn't going well.   How has Tecfidera been for you? Any other side effects?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692873027682857851/Post-Vacation-Fatigue	Post Vacation Fatigue	Hey everyone! I have been dealing with some post-vacation fatigue since I returned home yesterday morning and was curious if anyone else felt this way or had any advice. I am newly diagnosed with minimal symptoms so it's been hard for me to identify what is MS and is “normal”. I was on vacation for 10 days that involved traveling/walking/etc... During the days I was good about staying active, but I would want to be in bed by 9pm and wasn't getting great sleep (I would sleep for 2-3 hours on and off). I returned home yesterday morning and basically struggled to get off my couch, due to my exhaustion. I was able to sleep a decent amount last night, but I still don't feel 100% today. I have an apt. tonight with my neuro so hopefully I can discuss it with her, but I also wanted to hear from this community to see if anyone had any advice or feedback.

How badly did I screw up by going untreated for ~2 years? Also, should I push for an MS specialist?	~20 months ago, I had a pretty bad attack that left me paralyzed on one side of my body, but then resolved some hours later. It took nearly a year, and a bunch of tests, to get a diagnosis of MS. I was in denial somewhat because I had had no further attacks and felt relatively fine, until this september when I had an attack that damaged my spine, causing me to be unable to feel cold on my right side and inducing some difficulty with gross motor movements in my right hand. This has mostly recovered, except I still can't feel cold temperatures in my right foot. This finally convinced me to start a DMT after putting off spinal taps and the JCV test for months. Now I'm reading about brain atrophy, this and that, and am curious how badly I messed up by delaying any form of treatment. My right side is slightly worse and I definitely feel a bit foggy mentally nowadays (although I wonder if this is from the plegridy or simple stress). Did I really screw myself? Also, my neuro put me on plegridy and seemed somewhat skeptical of newer drugs. Everything I've read says that aggressive early treatment is preferred? Should I either broach the subject of stronger meds or switching to a specialist? I'm currently on medicaid, so I'm unsure its its possible. One more thing: I keep reading on here that interferons do nothing to slow brain atrophy. Is that true? I found this study and it seems to say differently, but I don't know how reliable it is. https://msddjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40893-017-0033-3 I'm assuming pseudoatrophy isn't the same as actual atrophy? 	1	1	How|badly|did|I|screw|up|by|going|untreated|for|~|2|years|?|Also|,|should|I|push|for|an|MS|specialist|?	~|20|months|ago|,|I|had|a|pretty|bad|attack|that|left|me|paralyzed|on|one|side|of|my|body|,|but|then|resolved|some|hours|later|.|It|took|nearly|a|year|,|and|a|bunch|of|tests|,|to|get|a|diagnosis|of|MS|.|I|was|in|denial|somewhat|because|I|had|had|no|further|attacks|and|felt|relatively|fine|,|until|this|september|when|I|had|an|attack|that|damaged|my|spine|,|causing|me|to|be|unable|to|feel|cold|on|my|right|side|and|inducing|some|difficulty|with|gross|motor|movements|in|my|right|hand|.|This|has|mostly|recovered|,|except|I|still|can't|feel|cold|temperatures|in|my|right|foot|.|This|finally|convinced|me|to|start|a|DMT|after|putting|off|spinal|taps|and|the|JCV|test|for|months|.|Now|I'm|reading|about|brain|atrophy|,|this|and|that|,|and|am|curious|how|badly|I|messed|up|by|delaying|any|form|of|treatment|.|My|right|side|is|slightly|worse|and|I|definitely|feel|a|bit|foggy|mentally|nowadays|(|although|I|wonder|if|this|is|from|the|plegridy|or|simple|stress|)|.|Did|I|really|screw|myself|?|Also|,|my|neuro|put|me|on|plegridy|and|seemed|somewhat|skeptical|of|newer|drugs|.|Everything|I've|read|says|that|aggressive|early|treatment|is|preferred|?|Should|I|either|broach|the|subject|of|stronger|meds|or|switching|to|a|specialist|?|I'm|currently|on|medicaid|,|so|I'm|unsure|its|its|possible|.|One|more|thing|:|I|keep|reading|on|here|that|interferons|do|nothing|to|slow|brain|atrophy|.|Is|that|true|?|I|found|this|study|and|it|seems|to|say|differently|,|but|I|don't|know|how|reliable|it|is|.|https://msddjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40893-017-0033-3|I'm|assuming|pseudoatrophy|isn't|the|same|as|actual|atrophy|?

Which usually triggers symptoms since my first flare up. Periods were fine and dandy after the introduction of birth control and I left ~puberty~ but now it's back to bad cramps and mood swings with the addition of tingling legs and fatigue! The two things combined has me anxious and angry and sad and I just wanted to get it off my chest in a place people would understand. I don't want to go see some new dude who's going to look at me and think I'm faking or exaggerating. Some new doctor with way too many patients who doesn't really give a shit. Who tells me that I need more pills when in reality I need ways to manage stress and eat better or something. Just not chemicals that are going to cause more symptoms causing them to put me on more pills. I want off the meds I'm on, besides tecfidera (if it's still working). And I'm afraid he's going to say no, and keep me on pills that are expensive and cause more issues. I just want a specialist who listens and cares. Maybe I'm expecting the worst because I'm in a bad mood and remembering when my mom would go with me to appointments and talk to the doc for me and the two of them would carry on without my input (I was 20 at diagnosis). Or the fact that I read over my medical notes that my mom had access to which apparently had very private details relating to asking about MMJ and painful sex. Im fed up being treated like a child as a patient. 	1	1	First|appt|with|a|new|specialist|tomorrow|...	...|and|I'll|be|on|the|worst|day|of|my|period|.|Which|usually|triggers|symptoms|since|my|first|flare|up|.|Periods|were|fine|and|dandy|after|the|introduction|of|birth|control|and|I|left|~|puberty|~|but|now|it's|back|to|bad|cramps|and|mood|swings|with|the|addition|of|tingling|legs|and|fatigue|!|The|two|things|combined|has|me|anxious|and|angry|and|sad|and|I|just|wanted|to|get|it|off|my|chest|in|a|place|people|would|understand|.|I|don't|want|to|go|see|some|new|dude|who's|going|to|look|at|me|and|think|I'm|faking|or|exaggerating|.|Some|new|doctor|with|way|too|many|patients|who|doesn't|really|give|a|shit|.|Who|tells|me|that|I|need|more|pills|when|in|reality|I|need|ways|to|manage|stress|and|eat|better|or|something|.|Just|not|chemicals|that|are|going|to|cause|more|symptoms|causing|them|to|put|me|on|more|pills|.|I|want|off|the|meds|I'm|on|,|besides|tecfidera|(|if|it's|still|working|)|.|And|I'm|afraid|he's|going|to|say|no|,|and|keep|me|on|pills|that|are|expensive|and|cause|more|issues|.|I|just|want|a|specialist|who|listens|and|cares|.|Maybe|I'm|expecting|the|worst|because|I'm|in|a|bad|mood|and|remembering|when|my|mom|would|go|with|me|to|appointments|and|talk|to|the|doc|for|me|and|the|two|of|them|would|carry|on|without|my|input|(|I|was|20|at|diagnosis|)|.|Or|the|fact|that|I|read|over|my|medical|notes|that|my|mom|had|access|to|which|apparently|had|very|private|details|relating|to|asking|about|MMJ|and|painful|sex|.|Im|fed|up|being|treated|like|a|child|as|a|patient|.

Feelings of suicide and fear of multiple sclerosis diagnosis. Please help - REPOST as my post was somehow deleted?	Hello everybody, this is my first post here with an obvious throwaway account. Im creating this post in response to my internal feelings of dread and anxiety as to what i believe to be multiple sclerosis symptoms that i have been suffering for the past 4 years. Long post ahead, prepare. for the past 4 years and straight out of high-school i headed into community college with a fresh outlook. Much of my grades were below average and i wanted to maintain a better aptitude when entering community college, needless to say i didn't and continued my streak of apathy. fast forward 2 years later i was ejected temporarily from community college due to low grades as financial aid did not want to pay for my classes anymore. i had to work for enroll again, which i did and im back in college now. during those 2 years i noticed a change in my body, it started off with a progressive feeling that my brain wasn't working to full potential, i couldn't recall words the same way i could back in highschool, i used to be very coherent and my oratory skills were excellent, memorizing vocabulary was one of my favorite pastimes due to it creating a feel of pretentiousness despite my below average grades. This feeling though, it stuck with me and created anxiety, i felt as if i was losing vocabulary and my brain was slowly degrading, but i left it to anxiety as i had previous issues with anxiety and panic attack causing me to believe i had cancer, stomach cancer, and heart disease. i couldn't get the right words i wanted out, they just wouldn't come to me so i just socked it up to bad sleep. at the same time another symptom was unfolding i was losing my libido and sexual attraction, nothing i did elicited feelings of sexual excitment, checking other chicks out regardless if they looked average or below average would give me the strongest desire to have sex, but during this 3 year period i felt my drive just slowly disappear and today i have nothing at all, i can't even have sex with my girlfriend since i can't get erection due to extreme fatigue and a general sensation of low energy. i Forgot to mention as-well that during the past 4 years i have been feeling EXTREME fatigue, again i just socked it up to bad sleep since i would always go to sleep at 3 in the morning , but even fixing that didn't change anything. some days the fatigue is so bad i do not want to get up or even move since i feel so tired and debilitated talking fast is another issue, i used to be able to be very coherently while talking fast, but today i find myself just slurring my words and sounding like an alien if i talk to fast, i have to forcefully slow myself down to get out what i want to say coherently, AND EVEN THAN i still have trouble thinking of the correct words. When before this used to never be a problem. i am very afraid right now and im trying to maintain my composure. The reason i am making this post is due to a new symptom altogether, i was recently hospitalized due to this symptom, the panic attack was what got me in the hospital although, not the symptom in itself. the past 6 days have been horrible for me i have an extreme sensation of pins and needles all over my extremities, my stomach, my legs, arms and up to my neck. no matter what i do. if i lie down, walk, or attempt to sleep im feeling them consistently everyday, every hour for the past 5 days and its scaring the hell out of me. it scared me so much that just shy of two days ago i rushed myself to the hospital due to a panic attack i had because off it. Tho at the hospital they told me nothing was wrong even though i told them that im clearly feeling this sensation regardless if i feel anxious or not. They said it was me hyperventilating over an anxiety attack. i only sleep out of EXHAUSTION, instead of attempting to go to sleep because the sensation is so STRONG Today im still feeling the pins and needles sensation, if i calm myself down it is reduced, but still constant. PLEASE help i really believe this to be the culmination of untreated MS after 4 years of just feeling two symptoms. im going to the doctor tomorrow in the morning as soon as i wake up with the hope that my md will see the self diagnosis that we've both been trying to look for, for the past 4 years. 	1	0	Feelings|of|suicide|and|fear|of|multiple|sclerosis|diagnosis|.|Please|help|-|REPOST|as|my|post|was|somehow|deleted|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4692224222251453197/My-MS-roadblock	My MS roadblock	I (22F) was diagnosed with MS in September. Since then I feel like my life had been on a downward spiral. At the time of the diagnosis, I felt pressure from my family to leave H-TX where I had just started a new job soon after graduating from college. With the pressure coming from my family I decided to move back home to Chicago and quit my job. Since September I have been jobless and it has been tough going from being completely independent to living at home with my parents.

I am trying to learn more about what DMTs are ""cutting edge"" or newer and which ones are ""Old school"" or not used as often anymore. For example, Ive been told the copaxone, should rarely be used unless you are or plan to be pregnant, otherwise it is hardly better than water at treating MS. I'm also trying to tease out when you need to be ""aggressive"" and take medicine that has the laundry list of scary side effects that include death from other viruses, diseases or cancers, and when you can be more modest in your treatment option. My current neuro often mentions how it only takes 1 lesion in the wrong spot for me to lose functioning, sight, bladder control, memory, etc. And she is concerned that I have lesions in both my brain and spine. It is just hard for me to consider taking aggressive meds when on a daily basis I am 99.8% functional with just annoying and slightly painful moments. I wish there was a way they could figure out how MS is activated in each of our bodies so they could tell which medicine would work best for each of us individually! Thanks in advance!

Recovering from an exacerbation, and go a cold; exhaustion is normal, right?	Background: I'm newly diagnosed, but I've had symptoms for the past 11 years. In October, I had a major exacerbation and had to be hospitalized. Question: I was getting steadily better, but last week I got a cold, and it has kind of been kicking my ass; I'm just totally exhausted, and if I'm even slightly active one day (i.e. walked around the grocery store), I'm really freaking tired the next day. Has anyone else experienced this with a cold? Additional details: Overall, it seems like the cold is following the natural progression (sore throat has receded and been replaced by sinus congestion, and now coughing, which is the usual sequence of events I remember from previous colds), but it seems to be taking longer than normal, even though I'm not actually on DMT yet (will be starting Ocrevus in February). EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to respond. It's very reassuring to hear that what I'm going through is normal.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4691870329234940692/Trying-to-love-my-body	Trying to love my body	I've been fighting my body for longer than I may even know. I remember fighting it when I was 8 years old, quitting my ballet-type dance team. I cried because I didn't want to quit even though I was in too much pain to dance anymore. I hated my body for it. I remember hating it when I couldn't carry my backpack somedays in middle school. My little sister would walk me to my class and I hated my body for not being able to carry my own backpack. I remember hating it when they diagnosed it with Juvenile Arthritis, and later when they changed the diagnosis to Fibromyalgia, and when they changed it to MS I loathed my body. But as I got up today and gently braided my falling out hair (thanks Tecfidera) into two thin braids, and wrapped some ice on my head for a migraine (thanks MS), I thought about how my body is doing the best it can. It has an autoimmune disease. That just means it's broken and confused. It's doing the best it can. I need to find reasons to love it. It still breathes, and my heart still beats, and it's alive. It's just doing the best it can. I can love it for those things. I breathed a sigh of relief. I felt as if I dropped a weapon to the floor. I just breathed. I don't want to fight it anymore. My body is doing the best it can. I can love it for that. I'm writing this because everyone here has reasons to hate their bodies. And maybe you forgot that you're body isn't the enemy. Maybe you too need to remember all the reasons you should love it. 	1	1	Trying|to|love|my|body	I've|been|fighting|my|body|for|longer|than|I|may|even|know|.|I|remember|fighting|it|when|I|was|8|years|old|,|quitting|my|ballet-type|dance|team|.|I|cried|because|I|didn't|want|to|quit|even|though|I|was|in|too|much|pain|to|dance|anymore|.|I|hated|my|body|for|it|.|I|remember|hating|it|when|I|couldn't|carry|my|backpack|somedays|in|middle|school|.|My|little|sister|would|walk|me|to|my|class|and|I|hated|my|body|for|not|being|able|to|carry|my|own|backpack|.|I|remember|hating|it|when|they|diagnosed|it|with|Juvenile|Arthritis|,|and|later|when|they|changed|the|diagnosis|to|Fibromyalgia|,|and|when|they|changed|it|to|MS|I|loathed|my|body|.|But|as|I|got|up|today|and|gently|braided|my|falling|out|hair|(|thanks|Tecfidera|)|into|two|thin|braids|,|and|wrapped|some|ice|on|my|head|for|a|migraine|(|thanks|MS|)|,|I|thought|about|how|my|body|is|doing|the|best|it|can|.|It|has|an|autoimmune|disease|.|That|just|means|it's|broken|and|confused|.|It's|doing|the|best|it|can|.|I|need|to|find|reasons|to|love|it|.|It|still|breathes|,|and|my|heart|still|beats|,|and|it's|alive|.|It's|just|doing|the|best|it|can|.|I|can|love|it|for|those|things|.|I|breathed|a|sigh|of|relief|.|I|felt|as|if|I|dropped|a|weapon|to|the|floor|.|I|just|breathed|.|I|don't|want|to|fight|it|anymore|.|My|body|is|doing|the|best|it|can|.|I|can|love|it|for|that|.|I'm|writing|this|because|everyone|here|has|reasons|to|hate|their|bodies|.|And|maybe|you|forgot|that|you're|body|isn't|the|enemy|.|Maybe|you|too|need|to|remember|all|the|reasons|you|should|love|it|.

What I know so far: he has RRMS. Diagnosed a decade ago. Had his thyroid removed in November and is about two weeks into recovery from three rounds of Lemtrada infusions. A few things I am trying to wrap my head around 1) short notice cancellations of plans. I am a single mom and only have a finite about of time. I understand that this is a part of his disease but I am struggling with being all dolled up and then going home because I didn't make other plans. 2) It appears ED is an issue for him. He says this will get better over time. I'm fine with waiting but if it doesn't can't he just pop some viagra and be done with it? I don't have any judgement or less attraction for him needing to do this but at some point I want to have actual sex. TLDR - how do I deal with dating someone I really like that's has MS but has issues with last minute cancellations and ED? 	1	1	Dating|someone|with|MS|(|He|has|it|,|I|do|not|)	I|(|41F|)|just|met|someone|(|40M|)|a|month|ago|.|We|had|a|fantastic|first|date|.|We've|had|three|dates|since|.|I|knew|he|has|MS|going|in|.|I|grew|up|with|Incurable|illness|in|my|family|so|it|wasn't|a|deal|breaker|for|me|.|What|I|know|so|far|:|he|has|RRMS|.|Diagnosed|a|decade|ago|.|Had|his|thyroid|removed|in|November|and|is|about|two|weeks|into|recovery|from|three|rounds|of|Lemtrada|infusions|.|A|few|things|I|am|trying|to|wrap|my|head|around|1|)|short|notice|cancellations|of|plans|.|I|am|a|single|mom|and|only|have|a|finite|about|of|time|.|I|understand|that|this|is|a|part|of|his|disease|but|I|am|struggling|with|being|all|dolled|up|and|then|going|home|because|I|didn't|make|other|plans|.|2|)|It|appears|ED|is|an|issue|for|him|.|He|says|this|will|get|better|over|time|.|I'm|fine|with|waiting|but|if|it|doesn't|can't|he|just|pop|some|viagra|and|be|done|with|it|?|I|don't|have|any|judgement|or|less|attraction|for|him|needing|to|do|this|but|at|some|point|I|want|to|have|actual|sex|.|TLDR|-|how|do|I|deal|with|dating|someone|I|really|like|that's|has|MS|but|has|issues|with|last|minute|cancellations|and|ED|?

As my neurologist suggested, a good diet can't hurt MS but won't help. I was told I don't need other issues on top of MS so it's my best in my best interest I eat healthy. I find some people downright hostile to suggestions that Diet can help which brings me to Lorraine Lee, a test subject of Ocrevus. Here is what she says about Ocrevus >“I still see small improvements,” she said. “It's not as fast as I'd like it to be, but the fact there's been no more regression is meeting the goal of Ocrevus, and I'm also starting to see small improvements in my mobility.”“If you're really in tune with your body, you notice little improvements,” added Lee, who maintains a strictly dairy-free, gluten-free diet, and eats lots of vegetables and protein. “For example, I had gotten to the point, before Ocrevus, where my husband had to fill out all my paperwork because I could not write. And now I'm independent with my writing again.” But here is what she says about Wahl's diet, and remember she is a nurse and believes in DMT, >1. Diet. I would encourage the readers who have MS to read the book The Wahls Protocol written by Dr. Terri Wahls, was also has MS. I found the book extremely helpful. I have changed my diet after reading her book. The first step, eating 9 cups of vegetables and fruits (at least 6 cups of vegetables) was challenging, but after a month I began ever so slightly to feel better. Per Dr. Wahls' book, I then began a gluten-free and dairy-free diet. My energy is slowly returning and my functional level is improving. I began the diet change in March 2017. Some people say they could never give up bread and cheese, but it is a small price to pay when I have seen significant results. I don't want to start an argument, just want some discussion. 	1	1	For|those|who|believe|diet|does|nothing|for|MS|:|What|do|you|make|of|Lorraine|Lee|,|a|test|patient|of|Ocrevus	Now|,|I|don't|lean|one|way|or|another|.|As|my|neurologist|suggested|,|a|good|diet|can't|hurt|MS|but|won't|help|.|I|was|told|I|don't|need|other|issues|on|top|of|MS|so|it's|my|best|in|my|best|interest|I|eat|healthy|.|I|find|some|people|downright|hostile|to|suggestions|that|Diet|can|help|which|brings|me|to|Lorraine|Lee|,|a|test|subject|of|Ocrevus|.|Here|is|what|she|says|about|Ocrevus|>|“|I|still|see|small|improvements|,|”|she|said|.|“|It's|not|as|fast|as|I'd|like|it|to|be|,|but|the|fact|there's|been|no|more|regression|is|meeting|the|goal|of|Ocrevus|,|and|I'm|also|starting|to|see|small|improvements|in|my|mobility|.|”|“|If|you're|really|in|tune|with|your|body|,|you|notice|little|improvements|,|”|added|Lee|,|who|maintains|a|strictly|dairy-free|,|gluten-free|diet|,|and|eats|lots|of|vegetables|and|protein|.|“|For|example|,|I|had|gotten|to|the|point|,|before|Ocrevus|,|where|my|husband|had|to|fill|out|all|my|paperwork|because|I|could|not|write|.|And|now|I'm|independent|with|my|writing|again|.|”|But|here|is|what|she|says|about|Wahl's|diet|,|and|remember|she|is|a|nurse|and|believes|in|DMT|,|>|1|.|Diet|.|I|would|encourage|the|readers|who|have|MS|to|read|the|book|The|Wahls|Protocol|written|by|Dr|.|Terri|Wahls|,|was|also|has|MS|.|I|found|the|book|extremely|helpful|.|I|have|changed|my|diet|after|reading|her|book|.|The|first|step|,|eating|9|cups|of|vegetables|and|fruits|(|at|least|6|cups|of|vegetables|)|was|challenging|,|but|after|a|month|I|began|ever|so|slightly|to|feel|better|.|Per|Dr|.|Wahls|'|book|,|I|then|began|a|gluten-free|and|dairy-free|diet|.|My|energy|is|slowly|returning|and|my|functional|level|is|improving|.|I|began|the|diet|change|in|March|2017|.|Some|people|say|they|could|never|give|up|bread|and|cheese|,|but|it|is|a|small|price|to|pay|when|I|have|seen|significant|results|.|I|don't|want|to|start|an|argument|,|just|want|some|discussion|.

Diagnosed with CIS after one lesion on MRI and symptoms last month....vision symptoms coming back now and I’m confused.	Hi all! I was just recently diagnosed with CIS when I started having strange neurological symptoms for the first time on Nov 1. I took blood tests, had 3 MRIs, and a 3 day course of solumedrol before I was diagnosed with CIS at my follow-up appt last week. My initial concerns were left side facial/mouth numbness and weird vision issues—very hard to explain, as it wasn't exactly double-vision, and i could still see, but it was almost like my eyes didn't want to connect to my brain. After the steroid infusion, everything went back to normal after a few weeks. Flash to today and my eyes are starting to feel a little wobbly and weird again—not as bad as before, but enough for me to get worried I'm having a relapse/flare (what is the difference?). I wasn't expecting anything to happen again—I am not on any medications except for Vitamin D and I am getting a follow-up MRI in 6 months, unless symptoms re-emerge. Is this “normal” for CIS or for CIS that involved eye issues? I'm just not sure if this is something I need to call my doctor about. 	1	1	Diagnosed|with|CIS|after|one|lesion|on|MRI|and|symptoms|last|month|...|vision|symptoms|coming|back|now|and|I|’|m|confused|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4691516436388019032/New-to-Reddit-and-Newly-Diagnosed	New to Reddit and Newly Diagnosed	Hello everyone! I'm 41, M, and an aerospace engineer. I just got diagnosed the week before Christmas with MS. I'd been having issues with my right leg. I run about 10 miles a week so I just figured that I'd hurt my knee. My leg just felt weak and unstable. I'd drag my toes occasionally when I walked and ran and that was what made me go see my doctor. She recommended physical therapy. My physical therapist saw some thins that made her feel it was neurological and recommended I get an MRI. The brain MRI showed 2 active lesions and several old ones. Still waiting to get the MRI of my spine. My neurologist said that judging by the old damage. I've had a few strange things over the years. Vertigo, issues with my right hand, I even asked my doctor for an MRI years ago because I felt really off and like I was having a stroke! Right now I'm still struggling through all the emotions and trying to accept all the changes. I feel like I'm grieving for my old life. Even though I know things haven't really changed much. My right leg has gotten stronger with exercise and I don't drag my toes anymore. My right hand isn't as fast or as dexterous as my left. I get headaches pretty often.

Basically both illnesses are pretty similar, both autoimmune, and symptoms overlap I've had a terrible bacterial gut infection which I'm pretty sure I got rid of for the most part with antibiotics, and probiotics For almost 2 years I was completely bed ridden, and for the few months before I took major action I really felt I was going to die, I lost so much weight, was incredibly dehydrated and malnourished, could barely eat or hold down anything, I would be awake for 3 hours maximum before passing out, constant migraines, just felt so sick and terrible. I feel a bit better now, as in I don't feel constantly on the verge of death, but it's still pretty bad. Went to multiple doctors, and general practitioners, them being no help Had to go to a naturopath, endocrinologist, rheumatologist, and was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis They offered no help pretty much, except pain meds and antidepressants I tried so hard looking for different diets and supplements, none of which really helped me I kind of just gave on my health and life But I now see I have basically everything symptom of Multiple Sclerosis, and have for a long time I don't know much about it, I'm not yet formally diagnosed by a doctor But is there some cure, treatment, cause???

I'm in a differential diagnosis for MS after having slow but sure progression for the last 4 (almost 5) years. I'm currently diagnosed with 'CIS and corticobasal movement disorder, lesions at c3 and c6 and areas of subcortical hyperintensity and ocliglonal banding' - we're waiting for a relapse or 'insidious neurological progression' BUT asides from all that, I'm also taking my Masters in the History of Medicine and I'm thinking that I want to write on the History of MS, looking specifically at the 1800s-1900s and the codification of the disorder i.e. how it was recorded, how it became 'multiple sclerosis' and not 'disseminated sclerosis' and what makes it a diagnostic entity as well as old school treatments like [arsenic injected into your spine](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt81x07) (!!) I was wondering if anyone knew any sources beyond the usual 'History of MS' 'Portable history of MS' (MS Trust, MS Society, MS Association of America etc) - basically any uncommon research papers or books. I've ordered Multiple Sclerosis: The History of a Disease and will be trawling through resources at my home institution. I was also wondering, if this of interest to anyone? Is the historic context of the disease something that people would be interested in reading about, or knowing more about in general? 	1	1	I'm|thinking|of|writing|on|the|history|of|multiple|sclerosis|.

Hey guys, my mom has really been struggling with the depression side of things lately. She's been seeing her doctor and trying different medications, but lately I know she's been feeling lonely. I visit whenever I can, but it's the weekdays when my dad is at work that wear on her since she's unable to drive now, so I think she's really feeling stuck. She likes playing word games on her iPad, but I wish I could suggest something that was collaborative and/or that helped her feel fulfilled. They live in a rural area so there's not much for support groups, and even if there were she's never been interested because she's said she doesn't want to be around people who might have it worse off than her, if that makes sense. (Edit for clarity: this is not because she's not caring; she has an HUGE heart. She has just said this specifically about support groups because she finds it hard to talk about her disease and hear how it can progress, because she's scared. Even though she's had RRMS for 27 years.) I just want to know how to help. What helps you? 	1	1	Advice|:|What|can|my|mom|(|63|)|do|to|stay|busy|and|feel|less|lonely|?

I used to feel being sick as an acute experience. You know, pain in the chest or sinuses. Explicit and unique body aches (unique from everyday life). Obvious fever. I don't so much anymore. Haven't for awhile. Sickness now just makes me feel extra run down. The lack of acuteness makes me doubt myself and so I fear it makes me underestimate the illness. I was a nurse and used to wonder how old folks came in with sepsis because, their families said, they didn't feel sick. I was just recently diagnosed with an asymptomatic UTI.

Painful sensations in legs, burning feet. 2nd set of symptoms were 2015. Leg pain and weakness, loss of coordination. Could not walk properly for 17 days. Double vision, fatigue. Muscle spasms all over, even around my eyes MRI showed mild white matter disease, several small peri ventricular lesions. Possible MS. But nothing was ever done. September 2018: I had what I thought was the worst panic attack of my life. Started getting tingles in my head, squeezing chest, numb left arm and leg and severe vertigo. Ambulance was called and ER doctor said it was Panic. This has been going on almost daily since to varying degrees. I have felt as if I have been living in a dream for the last few months. Sometimes my foot will feel wet or like water going down one side of my body. I have episodes of squeezing or stabbing in my chest and ribcage since. 2 weeks ago I had a vertigo episode so bad that I fell out of the shower. I was trembling and could not stand. Another Ambulance ride. This time they thought it was a middle ear problem. Had another vertigo spell in the doctors office ""that's when he decided this wasn't panic"". He got another MRI. This latest MRI shows more white matter disease, peri ventricular lesions. Doctor has not seen me yet due to being on vacation. Tonight I had another episode. Starts with a tingly electrical sensation going down my body/in my chest, makes me nervous. But it seemed to make my left leg and pelvic area have strange sensations, not quite numb but not quite normal. I ended up urinating on myself without realizing it. Since then my left leg feels weak, heavy and I have a vibration sensation in it. This was by far the most embarrassing evening:( I feel like I am losing control of my body and it is more than just panic disorder.

For how common this is you'd think someone would have developed a competent note app that's easy to use but I have yet to find it. With MS this and/or sticky notes are kind of a requirement. I'm on Android (Pixel 3) and I'd love to find a good app for reminders and to jot notes quickly that doesn't have a million hoops to jump through and is free (without a billion ads). My favorite was Bear but that's only on iOS. Evernote is okay but still more complicated than I'd like at times. Google Tasks is what I'm currently using but I'm still curious if there's something better out there. 	1	1	Recommendations|for|reminder|/|notes|apps|?

I've put off trying to find any real outlet for this because you think visits and little research will do.

So, just a few things. I'm not asking for a diagnosis. I'm leaving that up to my doctor (who is an amazing doctor, btw.) I'm only asking for support, because I'm literally alone, scared and trying not to worry. (Also, I did ask if it was okay to post here.) Today, my doctor told me about my brain MRI. I was expecting to be told everything was fine. Except, he drew me a picture of what showed up on the MRI. He said I have several white spots on my brain that is indicative of M.S. I went numb. I'm 43 years old. I started wondering what my life might be like as I'm already diagnosed with an illness that causes chronic pain (and other symptoms) called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. As my doctor said, this diagnosis is the last thing I need. (Please know my heart goes out to everyone with M.S.) It's that the last six years have been extremely difficult with my CRPS and then to try and understand the M.S. diagnosis. Well, I feel lost. Today, I had several more MRIs done and bloodwork. Then, next week, I have the test where my spinal fluid is drawn and analyzed. I'm doing my best to stay positive. I think I'm still in a state of shock and somewhat denial. I have had almost two months of ongoing symptoms which is how I got to this point. I'll leave lose out for now... until I have news. Please, if anyone can help with kind words, so I can cope with this information. I'm going to be alone for Christmas as my symptoms are such it's not safe for me to drive nor can my family come get me (we live several hours apart.) I don't want to feel sorry for myself. Yet, I'm terrified to understand what this may mean for me down the road. I won't have results for another week due to the weekend and Christmas. TDLR: I received a possible diagnosis today of M.S. I'm currently undergoing more tests. I'm scared and alone. I am hoping to find some support through the diagnosis phase. 	1	0	I'm|(|f|)|needing|some|support|after|hearing|of|possible|diagnosis|today|.

I'm currently in good health, on meds and have minimal symptoms (and am not affected by heat, thank goodness), but I was wondering if anyone has had experience traveling to third world countries with MS.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4688626304981489892/Stem-Cell-Transplant-Lessens-Disability-and-Relapses-in-RRMS-Patients,-Phase-2-Trial-Shows	Stem Cell Transplant Lessens Disability and Relapses in RRMS Patients, Phase 2 Trial Shows	https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/12/21/stem-cell-transplant-lessens-disability-relapses-rrms-patients/ Stem Cell Transplant Lessens Disability and Relapses in RRMS Patients, Phase 2 Trial Shows DECEMBER 21, 2018 BY PATRICIA INACIO, PHD IN NEWS. Treatment with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (aHSCT) led to a sustained decrease in disability and almost no clinical relapses in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who had failed to respond to prior immunosuppressive therapies, an Australian Phase 2 trial shows. Trial findings were published in the study, “Prospective phase II clinical trial of autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant for treatment refractory multiple sclerosis,” in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by chronic inflammation that affects the nerves of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). The immune system intermittently causes loss of myelin, the protective cover of neurons, and triggers nerve cell death, causing significant neurological and motor disability. Due to its immuological origin, patients with RRMS have periods of severe symptoms followed by periods of partial or complete remission. These patients are thought to benefit from treatment with immunotherapies; however, this kind of therapy can lead to secondary effects. A different therapeutic approach, called an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, has been shown to suppress clinical relapses and inflammation, and even reverse disability in patients with RRMS and possibly also with secondary progressive MS (SPMS). aHSCT is performed using the patient's own hematopoietic stem cells, which are harvested and reinfused after a high dose of chemotherapy is used to destroy the immune cells reactive against the nervous system. The strategy is aimed at reconstituting a tolerant immune system in MS patients. However, it remains unclear which patients will better respond to the therapy. A team of researchers in Australia performed a prospective Phase 2 single-center trial (ACTRN12613000339752) to assess the efficacy of the treatment, and compare the results with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients who underwent similar transplants. The trial recruited a total of 35 patients, 20 of whom were diagnosed with RRMS and 15 with SPMS. The median age of the patients was 37 years, and the majority (69 percent) had been treated with four or more disease-modifying therapies, including Tysabri (natalizumab), but eventually relapsed. Patients received a median of 7.41 million hematopoietic stem cells per kilogram of body weight, and were followed for a median of 36 months. Before the transplant, they were given a high dose of a chemotherapy combo, called BEAM, delivered into the blood to erase their immune system before the stem cell transplant. The trial's primary objective was event-free survival (EFS), meaning no relapses and no disability progression. The overall EFS at three years was 60%. Patients with RRMS, in particular, showed an EFS of 90% for the first year, and 70% for the remaining two years; and a relapse-free survival of 97% at one year, and 90% at two and three years. The overall scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), commonly used for evaluating the severity of MS, showed a sustained significant decrease, meaning less disability. This improvement in EDSS score was largely seen in RRMS patients, with a mean decrease of 1.484 at three years. According to the team, the EDSS data “confirm that patients with RRMS respond more favorably to aHSCT than SPMS. As a result of this finding, our clinical trial criteria have been modified to only include patients with RRMS.” Post-transplant survival and overall survival in the study was 100%. There were no treatment-related deaths, but due to the high chemotherapy dose used, patients experienced complications that include mucositis (inflammation in the form of ulcers in the mouth or gut), nausea, and alopecia. The median length of their hospitalization was 23 days, 16 days post-stem cell transfusion. Moreover, the combination of BEAM chemotherapy followed by stem cell transfusion led to a decrease in pro-inflammatory immune T-cells, and to the recovery of a group of protective T-cells, called CD39-positive T-cells, which belong to the group of regulatory T-cells — those that keep the immune system from attacking its own tissues, and have a beneficial role in MS. These changes were not detected in the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients who received the same treatment. “In conclusion, this study provides further evidence that aHSCT using BEAM/ATG conditioning is a highly efficacious therapy for patients with MS, even after failing multiple therapies,” the researchers wrote, suggesting that failing multiple therapies “does not reduce the effectiveness of aHSCT.” According to the team, “this data is in agreement with other studies and recent guidelines, and confirms the important role of aHSCT as a therapeutic option for patients with RRMS.”.

This spread across more fingers and partly into the hand, then spread to the other hand as well, and into the upper stomach area (not the lower important parts thankfully!). I went to see a doctor who did some basic neurological tests (nothing) and sent me for a cervical xray. The only thing they found was normal age related stuff, and he suggested that it was muscular in nature. I got a muscle relaxant that just made me dizzy and didn't fix the problem. However, with time the numbness went away, and only came back lightly and for extremely short periods. Great! About 8 months ago, it came back again in the hands, only this time, it also affected my sense of touch from what was basically my upper chest, down my legs, and into my feet. I went to a chiropractor who made an adjustment right about where the numbness in my body started, and I got full feeling back within an hour - except for the hands... I didn't want to risk a neck adjustment, so I went to a walk in, who didn't see any obvious neurological symptoms, so he sent me for a bloodtest an urinalysis, both of which turned out to be of no concern. Life went on, but the reduced feeling in the fingertips didn't improve. Sometimes it's worse than other times, sometimes they're almost normal. Lately, my left leg end arm feel kind of ""off"" or inaccurate(?) as well, though it's got no lack of strength, and no pain or numbness. I recently found a good family doctor, who felt I should get an MRI done on my cervical spine to see if it was indeed a pinched nerve. I ended up getting called in for the MRI about a week later (cancellation?), and had it done earlier this week. To my surprise, my doctor got the results back later the same day, and asked me to come in the following day. The results were what appeared to be 3 small lesions, and while not conclusive, it's highly suggestive of ms, and from what I've been reading, that seems to be the most likely. She is referring me to a neurologist, and sending me for a brain MRI to confirm. Truth be told, I'm scared shitless, and I'm having a lot of trouble dealing with the idea. I have a wife and a mostly physical job to worry about, and I have no idea what to do. I don't know how I would afford needed medications if I can't work - hell, I don't know if I can afford them even if I'm working! I've had 2 separate short breakdowns today where I'm in tears, and I'm starting up again just typing this. I alternate between feeling positive about fighting this condition and breaking down in tears. I'm a 40+ male ffs - I almost never cry. I alternate between being angry at the world, angry at God, accepting of the randomness of this disease, being happy it isn't a worse disease... I guess I just needed to get this off my chest, and put it down in words as well as I can. Would anyone be willing to tell me about how you initially dealt with your diagnosis, and how you got through it? I'm really at a loss as to how to get through this. I'm talking to my wife of course, but she just doesn't have the same experience that many of you here seem likely to have. I could really use some real advice, and not just comforting words.

PSA: To anyone diagnosed with MS considering having bio children, just don't.	"Disclaimer: Long-ish rant. Remember, this is MY opinion so please remember that before considering downvoting. At least read the post first. I'm careful in how I word most things for a reason. Also, know that I don't blame any single person for MS. Your experiences and that of your children are just as valid as mine. I'm just coming at this from the perspective of a child who dealt with those raw emotions and wishes he had the option not to inherit this genetic ""gift."" BG with my blood family: mom had MS and I was dxd in my teens. I was convinced I was going to become a doctor and help her before MS wrecked that and my entire life following that. 2 of my maternal aunt's also carry MS. Both my maternal and paternal trees have several autoimmune diseases including lupus, ALS, Fibro, Chrons etc. Some of these overlap. I fully understand that prior to 15-ish years ago we didn't know MS was genetic (I grew up being told it wasn't). This only applies to those who had children fully knowing this fact. The reality is that MS being inherited is now common knowledge. We still don't know everything sure, but the fact that autoimmune conditions are strongly rooted in genetics isn't debated anymore. Not only that but having MS (or any autoimmune condition) significantly raises likely hood of developing another and this carries into further generations. Basically, what I'm saying is that from the perspective of a child born with this condition (and possibly your future children) its far too high statistically of a risk to take (and those %(s) are rising as we learn more). It isn't fair to you or us and it sucks... but it beats having to own up to your child someday if/when you pass this to them and throwing an absolute monkey wrench in your relationship. Consider how many ""alternatives"" there are. Adoption is of course the obvious one. I am adopted myself so I can vouch for the awesomeness on that option. Things like donors and surrogacy are options too depending on who carries the autoimmune baggage. Genetics can be retained partially with these options if that's important. Sure, these options carry risks but given the roulette that is medical issues I'd rather gamble with the random odds over something that I know to be my doing/absolute hell if it happens. With cancer, we are learning the genetic risks and can predict the likelihood, eventually MS too hopefully. But until we can prevent/absolutely rid ourselves of it, it simply is NOT worth the risk. I won't be having biological kids myself and I hope people start taking this more seriously. At least educate yourselves and understand your child doesn't get a say in this matter. Here's the puchline: We know beyond a shadow of a doubt MS has strong genetic ties. So if you know this and have a dx yet still plan on/try to have biological children, that's fine. The most likely odds are that they'll be MS-free. But after having MS yourself is it worth the risk of saying ""I screwed you and your life over. Sorry about this disease,"" Absolutely not. Sincerely, A child cursed from genetic abnormalities aka MS Edit: Citing sources--->https://ghr.nlm.nih. gov/condition/multiple-sclerosis#inheritance See ""causes"" and it describes what we think genetically might be responsible for MS.

New research into inflammatory diseases may have identified a way to treat MS. Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes loss of myelin, which is the fatty coating that insulates the fibers that carry electrical signals in the brain and the rest of the central nervous system (CNS). Now, scientists from the University at Buffalo, NY, have uncovered a previously unknown mechanism that could be preventing myelin repair in MS. The mechanism effectively stops progenitor cells from growing and developing into oligodendrocytes, which are the cells that make the myelin coating. It does this by stopping the cell cycle of the progenitor cells. Instead, it places them in a deactivated state called pathological quiescence. Progenitor cells are descendants of stem cells that have not yet fully matured into a final cell type. They can continue to divide as immature cells but cannot do this indefinitely like stem cells. The journal Cell Reports has published a study paper on the research. This identifies the driver of the mechanism as a protein called Paired Related Homeobox Protein 1 (PRRX1). The senior author of the study is Dr. Fraser J. Sim, who is an associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the university. MS is a disease that destroys myelin MS is an unpredictable, long-term disease, the primary feature of which is the erosion of myelin. The loss of myelin disrupts the flow of electrical signals in the CNS, often causing disability. As MS can affect any part of the CNS, symptoms vary widely. However, the most common symptoms include visual disturbance, mobility difficulties, extreme fatigue, and altered sensations. The symptoms of MS can persist and worsen over time, or they can come and go. MS has four major forms, depending on which symptoms arise and how they progress. Many experts are of the view that MS is an autoimmune disease, believing that the immune system launches an inflammatory attack on healthy myelin as though it were posing a threat. MS organizations have estimated that there are around 2.3 million people worldwide living with MS. In the United States, there is no official tracking of MS nationwide. However, the preliminary results of a National MS Society study suggest that there could be as many as 1 million people in the U.S. with MS. What might be preventing myelin repair? In the recent study, Dr. Sim and his team focused not so much on the destruction of myelin as on what might be preventing its repair. They found that switching on the gene that codes for PRRX1 stopped the cell cycle of the progenitor cells, effectively preventing them from dividing and differentiating into oligodendrocytes. Dr. Sim explains that these cells are ""responsible for all myelin regeneration in the adult brain."" The researchers demonstrated this effect in a mouse model of a childhood disease called leukodystrophy, which either prevents the formation of myelin or destroys it. Switching on PRRX1 induced pathological quiescence in human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells that they had transplanted into the mice. This stopped the cells from colonizing white matter in the brain and effectively stopped myelin regeneration. PRRX1 is a transcription factor, which is a type of protein that ""reads"" DNA code and carries it to messenger proteins that relay the information to various cell functions. The study also revealed that blocking the transcription factor stops other signals that could be preventing myelin repair. New direction for MS drug research Most MS drug research has focused on stimulating progenitors to mature into myelin-producing cells. The recent finding suggests that targeting the molecules that render progenitors inactive might be a promising alternative. ""The idea,"" says Dr. Sim, ""that pathological quiescence of progenitors could prevent regeneration in MS is distinct from the current preclinical strategies making their way into trial."" ""We plan to pursue the idea that perhaps we could identify treatments for MS that work by overcoming pathological quiescence of oligodendrocyte precursors in demyelinating lesions that characterize this disease."" -Dr. Fraser J. Sim.

"Brief history, I'm 24 (m) and have had MS nearly half my life. I've been on Tec. most of that time. Stopped due to bad rashes and intolerable stomach issues. Given my situation, my neurologist strongly recommended Tysabri. She also recommended Gilyenia but based on her words she's definitely more confident in Tysabri so I went for it. I'm getting my first infusion in January. My MS has never behaved like typical ""MS"" - I have symptoms that rotate without full blown relapses (like ever...) but they still say it's RRMS. I've seen the worst cases of MS (my mom) and basically figured being agressive is the best way to prevent that (yes I know MS severity is random, but I want to still be happy-ish when I'm 40). Betas would be a downgrade and Aubagio has hairloss so those are both no-go(s) for me. I'm JC negative and we're doing testing every 3 months for issues, but I'm still terrified of the significant immune risk (I'm already a walking germcatcher) among the others. But the medication is VERY effective and seems less invasive than other medications. How do you get over these worries? Especially if (when) you become JC+? Also, has anyone tried extended dosing? I want to suggest this but don't want to lessen the med's effectiveness. Seems ideal if it works though. Thanks in advance! This disease isn't fun...

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4687977522333011743/Fitting-MS-into-your-schedule?	Fitting MS into your schedule?	Tl;dr: Random bouts of double vision leads to one lesion on orbit MRI. Referral for neuro to do further testing. Want to go back to school, but had problems previously balancing medical issues and diagnostics. How much time does the path to possible diagnosis take out of a weekly/monthly schedule? Hi, I'm not looking for a diagnosis on Reddit but wondering about how much time the diagnosis process/early new diagnosis stages take per week or month. Background: 21/F with Ehlers Danlos and a ton of other issues already. Numbness, tingling, coordination, reduced sensations, fatigue and dizziness, Laryngomalacia all chalked up to EDS and associated disorders. Bouts of double vision and blurriness were what triggered my EDS specialist to order orbital MRI after the eye docs said I had perfect vision. Orbit MRI showed 11 mm abnormal bright focus in left cerebral peduncle (which wasn't there on mri from 5 years ago). So..... my eds specialist wants me to see a neuro for more testing etc. Interesting enough, I got incredibly bad sudden double vision/dizziness a week before finals my last semester there, docs said probably an inner ear infection, gave me prednisone, and it cleared up after 3ish weeks which may be related to this I suppose. Concerns: I'm supposed to go back to college full time starting in mid-January in a city a few hours from home. I actually had taken the last year off to treat other medical issues (dx w sleep apnea, hip labrum tear and surgery, narcolepsy, Laryngomalacia, carpal tunnel and surgery, probably something else I don't remember literally in the last year of medical leave). I wasn't able to be a full time student (no part time possible bc scholarship req.) and pursuit active/untreated medical issues. Ex. Takes 45 minutes to get to hospital from college, 45 min back plus whatever the length of appt is. Which leads to my questions... Questions: 1. Will going through the rest of testing likely interfere with school? How often are appts usually? 2. If I was to be diagnosed, how often would I have to take time out of my schedule for appts or related things? 3. Any advice on anything? 	1	0	Fitting|MS|into|your|schedule|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4687918520112382853/Figured-out-why-I've-fallen-recently.-It's-my-gait,-and-i-know-why.	Figured out why I've fallen recently. It's my gait, and i know why.	"tl/dr: With months of physical therapy, I've put some pieces together and learned how to address my own issues. uI'm kinda psyched about that. I know what I need to do about a symptom, and that makes me feel happy that I'm being more engaged with this disease.   So, this is progress in my understanding of recent events and sensations in my body. I fell for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and again a few nights ago. Both were balance issues, but only to a degree, and both happened in the middle of the night, just out of bed. Since the second fall, I've been observing my movement. When walking around the office during the day, I walk relatively slowly, and the same thing nearly happens, However, I'm awake enough during the day to catch it before I lose balance, unlike in the middle of the night. What I'm observing is that my right leg (my right side is generally weak) is swinging inward a bit when I walk slowly. This is because some muscles in my right hip are not getting orders from their commander, and are sitting around, not helping out. At any rate... muscle not working well in my hip. When I kick out to take a step, the return journey does not stay straight and curves inward a bit. That puts me off balance, and during the day it is the cause of my ""balance checks"" where I reach out towards the wall for a teenie bit of reassurance. So, it's the same thing that happens during the day, happening worse when I'm tired. That's a typical MS thing for me: pretty good when rested, pretty bad when fatigued. The solution is to concentrate on the movement of my right leg when i'm walking slowly, and swing it straight forward and straight back. This burns a bit, it's tiring, but they only grow stronger. Basically, as my PT would tell me, muscles that support that movement need to grow stronger so they can compensate for the muscles not getting a good nerve impulse. We'll do some exercises to kick-start things a bit. "	1	1	Figured|out|why|I've|fallen|recently|.|It's|my|gait|,|and|i|know|why|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4687387676649296498/OTC-Supplement-Alpha-Lipoic-Acid--MS	OTC Supplement Alpha Lipoic Acid & MS	"Hi guys,   I just wanted to share some knowledge I recently stumbled upon. A friend was telling me about the antioxidant Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA), and talking about how it can have anti-inflammatory effects. On a lark I decided to google ""alpha lipoic acid and multiple sclerosis,"" and sure enough, there's some early research indicating that it reduced the speed of brain volume loss in people with secondary progressive MS by 68%. This was a small double blind placebo trial. ALA has been established to reduce insulin resistance in those with Type 2 Diabetes and protect against diabetic neuropathy, as well as possibly protecting against age related cognition and memory decline. So these guys pack a punch!   Risks include depletion of thiamine (vitamin B1) for those who are at risk of thiamine deficiency. Thiamine deficiency can be caused by heavy, regular use of alcohol. Otherwise ALA seems pretty damn safe.   I'm currently taking 600mg daily of ALA along with daily D3 5,000 IU, and a weekly dose of thiamine (B1) 100mg to be safe. Anybody have any experience with this supplement, or other thoughts and insights to share?

BCLI, +5.97% a leading developer of innovative autologous adult stem cell therapeutics for debilitating neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the Investigational New Drug (IND) application to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of NurOwn [(R)] for the treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). There are currently no FDA approved autologous cellular therapies addressing MS or other neurological diseases. While treatment options for patients with MS exist, there remains a significant unmet need in progressive MS. There is currently no FDA approved therapy that addresses more than one progressive form of MS. ""This is an extremely exciting moment as we expand BrainStorm's pipeline by introducing a new indication for NurOwn [(R)] in neurodegenerative disease,"" said Chaim Lebovits, president and CEO of BrainStorm. ""Through this trial, we are advancing a novel treatment modality into clinical-stage testing for progressive MS in early 2019."" MS affects approximately 1 million individuals in the U.S. and 2.5 million individuals worldwide. Approximately half of affected individuals will eventually develop progressive disease, which may lead to increasing levels of motor, visual, and cognitive functional impairment and disability. ""We are excited about the launch of early testing of this cell-based approach to treating progressive MS, for which there are few treatment options,"" commented Bruce Bebo, Ph.D., Executive Vice President of Research at the National MS Society. ""We look forward to better understanding the potential benefits and safety of this and other cell-based therapies for MS."" ""We are excited to participate in this Phase 2 clinical trial and hope that this innovative cell therapy approach leads to a new treatment option for patients with progressive MS,"" said Dr. Fred Lublin, Director of the Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for Multiple Sclerosis at Mount Sinai Medical Center and Saunders Family Professor of Neurology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. ""We are particularly pleased to see a scientifically rigorous approach to advance the science of stem cell therapeutics."" About NurOwn(R) NurOwn [(R)] (MSC-NTF) cells represent a promising investigational therapeutic approach to targeting disease pathways important in neurodegenerative disorders. MSC-NTF cells are produced from autologous, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that have been expanded and differentiated ex vivo. MSCs are converted into MSC-NTF cells by growing them under patented conditions that induce the cells to secrete high levels of neurotrophic factors. Autologous MSC-NTF cells can effectively deliver multiple NTFs and immunomodulatory cytokines directly to the site of damage to elicit a desired biological effect and ultimately slow or stabilize disease progression. BrainStorm is currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of autologous MSC-NTF cells for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). About BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. is a leading developer of innovative autologous adult stem cell therapeutics for debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. The Company holds the rights to clinical development and commercialization of the NurOwn(R) technology platform used to produce autologous MSC-NTF cells through an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement. Autologous MSC-NTF cells have received Orphan Drug status designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in ALS. BrainStorm is currently enrolling a Phase 3 pivotal trial in ALS (NCT03280056), investigating repeat-administration of autologous MSC-NTF cells at six sites in the U.S., supported by a grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM CLIN2-0989). The pivotal study is intended to support a filing for U.S. FDA approval of autologous MSC-NTF cells in ALS. For more information, visit BrainStorm's website at www.brainstorm-cell.com.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4687210730524675833/Thoughts-going-trough-my-head-every-day-and-how-to-cope-with-them	Thoughts going trough my head every day and how to cope with them	"*Sorry for this being such a long post, but I really had to get some of my thoughts off my chest to people who understand what I'm going through. My boyfriend is the sweetest and always supports me, but it's different talking to people who have experience with the things I'm talking about and even have gone through so much more.* So I (25, female, from Germany) have been diagnosed with MS about a month ago after I've been on vacation with my boyfriend in the US to visit my sisters living there. It all started after our 2nd stop in Albuquerque, NM, when all of a sudden both my feet started to feel as if they have fallen asleep, but they wouldn't wake up. Due to the altitude difference of where I normally live (sea-level) and now ABQ I thought it would get better over time, but it didn't. It started ""wandering"" up my legs, lower body, upper body and into my hands (interestingly my arms were not affected), until half of my body was just a numb blob. I could move and all, but it felt as if it wasn't my body. After 4 days we went to visit the doctor, although I was panicking about how high the bill would be, if my travel insurance would cover it and so on... The doctor couldn't do that much, and his first guess was me not being used to the high altitude, but he also said that he could prescribe me some steroids to help with the numbness, which I declined because of how scary it sounded. So we went on to travel through the country and continue our vacation as planned. After these 2 weeks I immediately went to my general practitioner back in Germany who sent me to the neurologist. He said I should get an MRI done of my head and my spine, and after the test results came in he called to tell me that I should be taken to the hospital for infusions and further tests. The 3-day infusion helped lower the symptoms of my numbness (which decreased over time, but my hands were still numb as to the point where I didn't know how to hold a pen) and after the lumbar puncture they handed me the results. MS, most probably RRMS because of some other occurrences in the past which probably were the first relapses together with the one in the USA. At the end of the hospital stay the doctors talked to me about the further process and which medication they'd recommend, handing me some information brochures to help me decide. I chose Ocrevus, and will receive my first infusions mid-january. Of course they also talked about eating healthy, working out, and what symptoms to expect during a relapse, as well as the symptoms and fatigue. **Which brings me to the actual topic I wanted to talk to you about.** My biggest fear is that I'm stuck in some kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. Meaning that I feel slow, tired, sluggish and all this because of the MS, so I lie in bed on weekends and in my free time, when instead it would be better and helpful with the fatigue and everything if I worked out, get some chores done, take a walk outside and just enjoy myself. But my brain keeps telling me I'm too tired, not strong enough, so I lie in bed all day...it's a downward spiral. Do you know some tips, tricks, or other motivational things to keep me up and going when I'm feeling down? I know I should take my time off and be careful not to overdo things, but I also feel bad for being so unproductive. I also have the feeling I'm getting worse at work, being less concentrated and can't focus on client projects, also due to the fact that my workplace is a rather large open office, with my colleagues running around, making weird noises, singing, drumming and all sorts of childish behavior (I work in an advertising agency, pretty relaxed work environment - sometime a bit too relaxed). I also have to torture myself to get up in the morning to be somewhat on time. I talked to my supervisor to get the chance of getting some work done from home, which he agreed to, but that will start in the new year at the earliest. I hope this will help a little. Edit: The last thing is that I'm feeling bad I have so many questions, I feel like I've asked the doctors a hundred times how fast the steroid therapy should be working and how long it will take for the numbness in my fingers to disappear completely (if this is possible, which they said is probable, but there is still some tingling and unfamiliar feeling left). Edit 2: Ok, sorry about all the editing, but my brain is like a sieve in the last days. Do you have any advice in how to have like...a brain-workout?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4686856837933227615/Temperature-sensitivity	Temperature sensitivity	You know when you go outside on a super cold windy day and your cheeks go numb? I've been getting that sensation on my legs between my knees and my ankles and on my arms between my elbows and my wrists. It happens when I get mildly cold. For example two nights ago I was wearing short sleeve jammies and my arms got outside my blankets in my nice snug room but just that mildly low temperature caused my arms to go numb. Last night I wore long sleeves to bed but my jammie bottoms were loose and ride up to my knees. Now, even though they were covered by my warm blankets, I woke up with numb lower legs. My feet are fine BTW. It happens during the day too. It also isn't easy to warm me back up. I put on a heating pad and even on the lowest setting it's painful. And the numbness does goes away after a while. So this isn't your standard numbness relapse. The cold weather is killing me. This has been happening for a solid week now. Anybody relate? Can this be a relapse? Could it be something other than my MS? It's borderline painful. I also am starting to become afraid of going outside.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4686502942735638532/Depression-	Depression >	Remember this... Depression is worst than MS! Depression can cause damage physically and mentally that no medication can reverse/help or cure. Depression will put you in places worst than hospitals, worse than the darkest room you can lock yourself into, worst than the pain you feel from any physical damage & not to mention depression can force you to hurt people that you love the most and nobody wants that. MS is a terrible disease but before all of the treatments, the doctors, the foundations we have us! It starts with your outlook, it starts with staying positive and thinking things through... I hate when I see people saying they are worthless because of MS or they don't want to live anymore. That's where you make MS take over everything and that's not who we are as humans, that's not who we are as warriors. Before MS we had problems, we had situations and guess what? We that are going through the MS issues made it through the problems we had before. What makes MS different? MS is just another obstacle! Just another rainy day before work, just another clog in the toilet and we can't just let it take the wheel because we are scared, nervous or just don't have a solution at this time! Take it a day at a time, surround yourself with solutions/help and not more problems and BS! We all have bad days, we all feel pain but who doesn't? It can always be worst trust me. Keep a positive mindset, keep yourself busy, stay ahead of your disease (yes your disease) we all need to have a direct relationship with our own conditions and do our part don't rely strictly on 1 visit a month or your next Dr appointment. You will be surprised how much impact you can have on your outcome once you focus and prioritize correctly. 	1	1	Depression|>	Remember|this|...|Depression|is|worst|than|MS|!|Depression|can|cause|damage|physically|and|mentally|that|no|medication|can|reverse|/|help|or|cure|.|Depression|will|put|you|in|places|worst|than|hospitals|,|worse|than|the|darkest|room|you|can|lock|yourself|into|,|worst|than|the|pain|you|feel|from|any|physical|damage|&|not|to|mention|depression|can|force|you|to|hurt|people|that|you|love|the|most|and|nobody|wants|that|.|MS|is|a|terrible|disease|but|before|all|of|the|treatments|,|the|doctors|,|the|foundations|we|have|us|!|It|starts|with|your|outlook|,|it|starts|with|staying|positive|and|thinking|things|through|...|I|hate|when|I|see|people|saying|they|are|worthless|because|of|MS|or|they|don't|want|to|live|anymore|.|That's|where|you|make|MS|take|over|everything|and|that's|not|who|we|are|as|humans|,|that's|not|who|we|are|as|warriors|.|Before|MS|we|had|problems|,|we|had|situations|and|guess|what|?|We|that|are|going|through|the|MS|issues|made|it|through|the|problems|we|had|before|.|What|makes|MS|different|?|MS|is|just|another|obstacle|!|Just|another|rainy|day|before|work|,|just|another|clog|in|the|toilet|and|we|can't|just|let|it|take|the|wheel|because|we|are|scared|,|nervous|or|just|don't|have|a|solution|at|this|time|!|Take|it|a|day|at|a|time|,|surround|yourself|with|solutions|/|help|and|not|more|problems|and|BS|!|We|all|have|bad|days|,|we|all|feel|pain|but|who|doesn't|?|It|can|always|be|worst|trust|me|.|Keep|a|positive|mindset|,|keep|yourself|busy|,|stay|ahead|of|your|disease|(|yes|your|disease|)|we|all|need|to|have|a|direct|relationship|with|our|own|conditions|and|do|our|part|don't|rely|strictly|on|1|visit|a|month|or|your|next|Dr|appointment|.|You|will|be|surprised|how|much|impact|you|can|have|on|your|outcome|once|you|focus|and|prioritize|correctly|.

I've been taking that since the beginning, with one flare-up a few years ago. Ended up doing a methylprednisolone infusion for that. I think I've been rather lucky with my symptoms to date (some fatigue, weakness, headaches, back pain, tingling hands). My most frustrating symptoms lately have been headaches and the MS Hug. But nothing keeps me from working and still staying active. I have a great support system at home, but even til today I still have some trouble talking about it with everyone because it's tough for others to totally understand everything I deal with. I was hoping to find some people on here around my age who are also dealing with MS to chat with. I could use some friends who are at the same point in their lives who are also fighting the good fight against MS. Or if anyone lives in the Buffalo, NY area, you can message me too. It's interesting to hear the experiences people have had with doctors in my area.

I even thought I had some form of brain cancer and saw an oncologist at one point. Well long time later I find out I have MS. I lost my job due to the many symptoms. I mean I'm sure they probably thought I was drug addled. The fatigue is bad, but I slog through it. Whats far worse is the cognitive dysfunction. I seem to have memory slips, confusion, and other issues at times. I was actually in the car earlier today and was waiting for someone so I hopped on the phone to waste some time, I looked up and slammed on the break because I thought I was suddenly driving, I was in a parking spot with the car off. It's the strangest sensation. I worked in a laboratory but found myself soon fired for these weird ""moments"" I also experienced my first MS hug right in the middle of work and I tried my best to play it off. So I'm curious how many people saught disability after the onset of these symptoms?

"I had a big, cognitive flare three years ago and lost my accounting job from it, two years ago. Since then I have gotten married and my husband has gotten a new job in Houston, TX. I'm saying behind in OKC, OK until my house sells. My dear mother says I'm depressed and she doesn't want me staying alone at my house just waiting for it to sell, she wants me to stay at her house. I appreciate her worrying about me and putting me up. Only a few more things to do remain on my house before we can put it on the market and when that happens, I'll go ahead and move to Houston. This morning Mom asked if I had 'looked into' any professionals or therapies that could help repair and/or recondition my brain and I told his that to the best of my knowledge, none existed. Mom then, (in a totally neutral, non-judgy tone) what my ""plan was"". Um, so far my plan has been to fix up my house to the best of my abilities (I'm working with a handyman and plan to hire an electrician for one thing, I know very well what I can and cannot do myself). After the house is fixed up and one the market, my plan is to go be a housewife and hopefully build a community around myself that includes friends, volunteer work, and a church community. I'm like to get a job down there but I know that might not be possible and my husband has been 1,000% clear that I DON'T HAVE TO WORK if I can't or don't want to. It just really hurt my feelings, ""Do you have a plan?"" I HAD a plan, Mom, I worked my ass off on that plan for 20 years and then the MonSter noticed and ripped it away. Just so I can say I checked, are there any therapies or exercises I could be doing to get my brain back to it's pristine 2015 condition? Thanks in advance.

As debate continues about the effects of medical marijuana on multiple sclerosis (MS) and other diseases, cannabis company GB Sciences and Louisiana State University (LSU) have agreed on a cannabinoid research and development project. This collaboration between a public and a private enterprise is a first in the therapeutic cannabis industry, according to a press release from GB Sciences. Louisiana permits the cultivation, extraction, processing, production, and sale of medicinal cannabis. Specifically, the five-year Master Research and Development Agreement for the production of therapeutic cannabis targeting severe medical conditions and diseases is with LSU's Agricultural Center. It results from a mutual wish to participate in joint projects related to the production of medicinal cannabis in the state. Following a public bidding process, the center chose GB Sciences subsidiary GB Sciences Louisiana to cultivate and produce therapeutic cannabis for Louisiana patients with specific disorders, namely MS, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cachexia (a condition that causes extreme weight loss and muscle wasting), seizure disorders, epilepsy, spasticity, Crohn's disease (an inflammatory bowel disease), muscular dystrophy, glaucoma, Parkinson's disease, muscle spasms, intractable pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, and some forms of autism. The agreement gives GB Sciences and the center the rights to background intellectual property during the collaborative research and development efforts to allow them to fully conduct their work. In addition, the parties will permit the commercialization of technology developed during the project. The two enterprises have had early discussions regarding opportunities for clinical trials, research collaboration, and general patient care with Pennington Biomedical Research Center, the LSU Health Science Centers in New Orleans and Shreveport, Louisiana, and other prominent medical centers. With a focus on biopharmaceutical development, GB Sciences has applied for the patented use of medical marijuana for Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, chronic pain, some heart problems, and neurodegenerative disorders such as MS. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society — which works to improve the lives of MS patients while working toward a cure — supports patients' rights to, where lawful, work with healthcare providers to get marijuana for symptomatic treatment. The nonprofit also supports more research to better understand prospective benefits and risks involving treatment with cannabinoids. Research studies suggest that some cannabis strains in particular can help with spasticity, pain, sleep quality, vision, and gastrointestinal problems. 	1	0	GB|Sciences|,|LSU|Partner|on|Cannabinoid|Research|and|Development|Project|for|MS|,|Other|Diseases	https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/12/12/gb-sciences-lsu-collaborate-cannabinoid-research-development-project/|DECEMBER|12|,|2018|BY|MARY|CHAPMAN|IN|NEWS|.|As|debate|continues|about|the|effects|of|medical|marijuana|on|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|and|other|diseases|,|cannabis|company|GB|Sciences|and|Louisiana|State|University|(|LSU|)|have|agreed|on|a|cannabinoid|research|and|development|project|.|This|collaboration|between|a|public|and|a|private|enterprise|is|a|first|in|the|therapeutic|cannabis|industry|,|according|to|a|press|release|from|GB|Sciences|.|Louisiana|permits|the|cultivation|,|extraction|,|processing|,|production|,|and|sale|of|medicinal|cannabis|.|Specifically|,|the|five-year|Master|Research|and|Development|Agreement|for|the|production|of|therapeutic|cannabis|targeting|severe|medical|conditions|and|diseases|is|with|LSU's|Agricultural|Center|.|It|results|from|a|mutual|wish|to|participate|in|joint|projects|related|to|the|production|of|medicinal|cannabis|in|the|state|.|Following|a|public|bidding|process|,|the|center|chose|GB|Sciences|subsidiary|GB|Sciences|Louisiana|to|cultivate|and|produce|therapeutic|cannabis|for|Louisiana|patients|with|specific|disorders|,|namely|MS|,|cancer|,|human|immunodeficiency|virus|(|HIV|)|and|acquired|immune|deficiency|syndrome|(|AIDS|)|,|cachexia|(|a|condition|that|causes|extreme|weight|loss|and|muscle|wasting|)|,|seizure|disorders|,|epilepsy|,|spasticity|,|Crohn's|disease|(|an|inflammatory|bowel|disease|)|,|muscular|dystrophy|,|glaucoma|,|Parkinson's|disease|,|muscle|spasms|,|intractable|pain|,|post-traumatic|stress|disorder|,|and|some|forms|of|autism|.|The|agreement|gives|GB|Sciences|and|the|center|the|rights|to|background|intellectual|property|during|the|collaborative|research|and|development|efforts|to|allow|them|to|fully|conduct|their|work|.|In|addition|,|the|parties|will|permit|the|commercialization|of|technology|developed|during|the|project|.|The|two|enterprises|have|had|early|discussions|regarding|opportunities|for|clinical|trials|,|research|collaboration|,|and|general|patient|care|with|Pennington|Biomedical|Research|Center|,|the|LSU|Health|Science|Centers|in|New|Orleans|and|Shreveport|,|Louisiana|,|and|other|prominent|medical|centers|.|With|a|focus|on|biopharmaceutical|development|,|GB|Sciences|has|applied|for|the|patented|use|of|medical|marijuana|for|Crohn's|disease|,|inflammatory|bowel|disease|,|asthma|,|chronic|pain|,|some|heart|problems|,|and|neurodegenerative|disorders|such|as|MS|.|The|National|Multiple|Sclerosis|Society|—|which|works|to|improve|the|lives|of|MS|patients|while|working|toward|a|cure|—|supports|patients|'|rights|to|,|where|lawful|,|work|with|healthcare|providers|to|get|marijuana|for|symptomatic|treatment|.|The|nonprofit|also|supports|more|research|to|better|understand|prospective|benefits|and|risks|involving|treatment|with|cannabinoids|.|Research|studies|suggest|that|some|cannabis|strains|in|particular|can|help|with|spasticity|,|pain|,|sleep|quality|,|vision|,|and|gastrointestinal|problems|.

After Copaxone (glatiramer acetate, marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals), Glatect is the first commercialized glatiramer-based medicine in Canada, and now available via prescription plans in seven provinces. Pendopharm, which is a division of Pharmascience in Montreal, launched the therapy in September 2017 as a lower-cost alternative to Copaxone. Glatect has been the sole glatiramer-based treatment approved by PharmaCare Special Authority in British Columbia for requests or renewals of such treatment since Nov. 27. With this decision, British Columbia becomes the first Canadian province to require a mandatory transition to Glatec for continued public coverage of glatiramer acetate treatment, according to a Pendopharm press release. Of note, patients taking glatiramer acetate must have transitioned to Glatec by May 28, 2019, to maintain PharmaCare coverage (some exceptions may apply). As with Copaxone, the active ingredient in Glatect is glatiramer acetate, which is a mixture of small synthetic proteins that resemble components of the myelin sheaths (the protective cover of neurons that is destroyed in MS). While its mechanism of action is not entirely known, glatiramer acetate is believed to redirect the MS-causing autoimmune response against myelin. As such, it works to lessen the number and intensity of flares patients' experience. Glatect offers a daily 20 mg/mL subcutaneous injection, through pre-filled syringes with autoinjectors that allow patients to self-administer the medicine. Patients can contact the Ally Patient Support Program for injection training, as well as reimbursement and financial support. “Our goal is to ensure a smooth transition to Glatect. Patients are our priority, which is why all Glatect patients are eligible for the Ally Patient Support Program,” Jean-François Lemieux, VP and general manager of Pendopharm, said in the release. Canada has one of the highest rates of MS in the world. Although the numbers vary between different studies, reports estimate that 77,000 adults live with the disease in the country. Glatect is available through public drug plans in seven Canadian provinces — Ontario, Alberta, Québec, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, and British Columbia; plans for all, except British Columbia, require RRMS patients starting on a glatiramer-based treatment use Glatect. “Glatect is a prime example of how Pendopharm, a Canadian company, contributes significantly to the sustainability of the health care system in Canada by making important therapies more affordable and, therefore, more accessible to patients,” Lemieux said. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two glatiramer acetate injection therapies, in addition to Copaxone — an equivalent generic by Mylan, and Glatopa, a generic form by Sandoz. 	1	0	CANADIAN|NEWS|:|Glatect|(|lower|cost|alt|.|to|copaxone|)|Added|to|Public|Drug|Plan|in|British|Columbia|as|Sole|RRMS|Treatment|of|Its|Type	I|don't|know|if|any|canadians|here|are|on|copaxone|-|and|isn't|your|healthcare|very|affordable|anyway|(|not|sure|about|that|,|i'm|in|the|u|.|s|.|)|?|i|thought|i'd|share|anyway|in|case|it's|useful|to|anyone|.|source|:|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/12/11/glatect-added-to-public-drug-plan-in-british-columbia-as-sole-rrms-treatment-of-its-type/|Glatect|Added|to|Public|Drug|Plan|in|British|Columbia|as|Sole|RRMS|Treatment|of|Its|Type|DECEMBER|11|,|2018|Santiago|Gisler|Pendopharm's|Glatect|(|glatiramer|acetate|)|—|a|treatment|for|patients|with|relapsing-remitting|multiple|sclerosis|(|RRMS|)|—|has|been|added|to|the|public|drug|plan|in|the|Canadian|province|of|British|Columbia|,|and|is|now|the|only|glatiramer-based|treatment|for|RRMS|patients|there|using|the|plan|.|After|Copaxone|(|glatiramer|acetate|,|marketed|by|Teva|Pharmaceuticals|)|,|Glatect|is|the|first|commercialized|glatiramer-based|medicine|in|Canada|,|and|now|available|via|prescription|plans|in|seven|provinces|.|Pendopharm|,|which|is|a|division|of|Pharmascience|in|Montreal|,|launched|the|therapy|in|September|2017|as|a|lower-cost|alternative|to|Copaxone|.|Glatect|has|been|the|sole|glatiramer-based|treatment|approved|by|PharmaCare|Special|Authority|in|British|Columbia|for|requests|or|renewals|of|such|treatment|since|Nov|.|27|.|With|this|decision|,|British|Columbia|becomes|the|first|Canadian|province|to|require|a|mandatory|transition|to|Glatec|for|continued|public|coverage|of|glatiramer|acetate|treatment|,|according|to|a|Pendopharm|press|release|.|Of|note|,|patients|taking|glatiramer|acetate|must|have|transitioned|to|Glatec|by|May|28|,|2019|,|to|maintain|PharmaCare|coverage|(|some|exceptions|may|apply|)|.|As|with|Copaxone|,|the|active|ingredient|in|Glatect|is|glatiramer|acetate|,|which|is|a|mixture|of|small|synthetic|proteins|that|resemble|components|of|the|myelin|sheaths|(|the|protective|cover|of|neurons|that|is|destroyed|in|MS|)|.|While|its|mechanism|of|action|is|not|entirely|known|,|glatiramer|acetate|is|believed|to|redirect|the|MS-causing|autoimmune|response|against|myelin|.|As|such|,|it|works|to|lessen|the|number|and|intensity|of|flares|patients|'|experience|.|Glatect|offers|a|daily|20|mg|/|mL|subcutaneous|injection|,|through|pre-filled|syringes|with|autoinjectors|that|allow|patients|to|self-administer|the|medicine|.|Patients|can|contact|the|Ally|Patient|Support|Program|for|injection|training|,|as|well|as|reimbursement|and|financial|support|.|“|Our|goal|is|to|ensure|a|smooth|transition|to|Glatect|.|Patients|are|our|priority|,|which|is|why|all|Glatect|patients|are|eligible|for|the|Ally|Patient|Support|Program|,|”|Jean-François|Lemieux|,|VP|and|general|manager|of|Pendopharm|,|said|in|the|release|.|Canada|has|one|of|the|highest|rates|of|MS|in|the|world|.|Although|the|numbers|vary|between|different|studies|,|reports|estimate|that|77,000|adults|live|with|the|disease|in|the|country|.|Glatect|is|available|through|public|drug|plans|in|seven|Canadian|provinces|—|Ontario|,|Alberta|,|Québec|,|Saskatchewan|,|Manitoba|,|New|Brunswick|,|and|British|Columbia|;|plans|for|all|,|except|British|Columbia|,|require|RRMS|patients|starting|on|a|glatiramer-based|treatment|use|Glatect|.|“|Glatect|is|a|prime|example|of|how|Pendopharm|,|a|Canadian|company|,|contributes|significantly|to|the|sustainability|of|the|health|care|system|in|Canada|by|making|important|therapies|more|affordable|and|,|therefore|,|more|accessible|to|patients|,|”|Lemieux|said|.|In|the|U|.|S|.|,|the|Food|and|Drug|Administration|(|FDA|)|has|approved|two|glatiramer|acetate|injection|therapies|,|in|addition|to|Copaxone|—|an|equivalent|generic|by|Mylan|,|and|Glatopa|,|a|generic|form|by|Sandoz|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4684910423659810941/The-medical-scarlett-letter	The medical scarlett letter	"So on top of multiple sclerosis I have a pretty messed up spine. 4 low spine surgeries and a fused vertebrae in my neck. 3 years ago I got in another car accident, was rear ended while at a stop to enter the highway, while looking it my window oncoming traffic when I got hit. It set much of the progress is made back in the department of neck pain and nerve issues. So, unfortunately I probably didn't need some of the low back surgeries, but the symptoms of my yet to be diagnosed MS confused the drs and probably got mistaken for some issues. It wasn't until the neck surgery that they discovered the MS some years later. Another unfortunate side effect of this medical mess was that now I have permanent sciatica issues in both legs, definitely worse on the left side, but the right side has its days as well. My low back is constantly sore and it's always an aggravation in some way, shape, or form. This has lead me to use opiods for pain management. I have no qualms at this point about it, it sucks being dependent on pain medication but it wasn't like I haven't tried the alternatives. Narcotics work for me, it's not easy living with the multiple sclerosis and some issues. Honestly it's been a life of excruciating existence, the pain medication isn't a magic bullet, and it doesn't completely relieve all my pain. What it does is makes this existence bearable, instead of being at 8 or 9 on that old pain scale, I can be at a functional 4 to 6. Now what happened today infuriates me. I had scheduled pin point injections for my neck. The place doing the procedure did not manage my pain medication, I did not sign any pain contract with them, and just would be getting these pin point injections around the nerves and muscles in my neck. At some point they did a urine screen, and even though I have not taken any methadone (my normal pain meds are just Percocet based), it showed in their urine screening. I told them it was a shock to me and I was taken back by this. I then mentioned I just had a urine screening at my PCP (who does manage my pain medication), that screening showed, as expected no methadone and just my normal pain medication. Yet this did not seem to matter the Dr. doing the procedure, and she said that because of this test they would not be doing the procedure. This not only shocked me, but also made me angry. I asked ""why is it if they will not be dealing with medication should this prevent my injection?"" The Dr claimed it dealt with trust issues and that if I was testing for methadone they couldn't do the procedure. At this point I was done, I told them I'd find another Dr and left. What really gets me as a person in genuine pain, with a clear medical history of 18 yrs of pain issues, 12 yrs of pain management with narcotics medication. Trust me the 6 years of not being on these medications and searching for a solution want fun and I tried everything to find relief. From nerve blocks, various non narcotic medication options, aqua therapy, epidurals, surgery (probably made things worse), acupuncture, and the list goes on and on, before I made this decision. I'm not an idiot and I don't abuse my medications! So being accused of taking medication I don't, and then being refused medical treatment by people who don't have anything to do with my pain medications. It's just seems like the second a Dr learns you are on narcotic pain medication they unfairly label you. I honestly don't know what happened here, cross contamination maybe as I have some old methadone pills around but they are from '09 and I didn't take any, or false positive as I've read some sleep aids can come back as methadone (I've used generic unisom occasionally), perhaps the lab fucked up... but it all just seems ridiculous that a procedure that even if I was going in high on methadone it would have no effect on that. I mean I'm on fairly high doses of oxycodone (generic for Percocet) and they were fine with doing the procedure with that in me, but apparently can't risk it with methadone? It makes no logical sense to me. Yes I understand the climate, but treating people (legit paitients or addicts) like this isn't anyway to deal with this issue. I'm a legit patient, with legit medical issues, yet as this climate escalates it feels like genuine patients are being lumped in with drug seekers and treated like addicts. I'm sorry my life has burdened me with these medical issues that require narcotics to deal with, but regardless of that it feels wrong to be treated in this manner and refused treatment. It really feels like I'm wearing a Scarlett letter whenever a new provider looks at my history and my medication list. What is the point of this all if you can't even seek treatment without being treated in a manner that makes you feel sub human. Ughhhh I just wish I was healthy but I'm not, it'd be nice to be treated like an intelligent living person and not some medical history or medication list. Just needed to vent about this weird unpleasant experience. I don't want this and would like not to deal with any of it any more, but that's just not an option.

Had an MRI done over a year ago and compared to recent MRI brought doctors to conclusion that lessons are connecting me closer to RRMS. As per doctors orders, I filled out the benefits coverage authorization form and submit it, no answers on if the copaxone is covered. Waited a week, call for a follow-up and got nothing. I have been patiently waiting but It has been a few months since my diagnosis and I have yet to get any answers from my benefits provider as to if my prescription is covered or not. I do not feel like any relapses have occurred but I don't know what exactly I'm looking at as a relapse. I'm always tired, my eye is still the same level of messed up as it was originally, my body aches, I can rarely get a good night sleep. I have the cooaxone starter kit, I have the support nurse, I have my support system by my side but I have no prescription or answers on what's next.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4684733479038996699/Im-so-glad-I-did-the-lumbar-puncture	I’m so glad I did the lumbar puncture	My MS Specialist is 99% sure that I don't have MS and the symptoms I had were just an infection and the 2 spots I have in my brain could be old. My VEP was normal. He said my symptoms are not matching the “criteria” but doctors like to blame anything on MS. He said it was an infection and should go away with steroids. I had an opportunity to go to free hospital so I did, and saw a neurologist who was 99% sure it _is_ MS. This neurologist thinks it's crucial to do a lumbar puncture.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4684674495621582675/Statistics-and-Percentages	Statistics and Percentages	Does anyone have a link to good graph/s that shows the statistical likelihood various MS related disabilities? For example... what percentage of people end up using a cane? How about using a wheelchair? How about blindness? And at about what ages on average to might these disabilities occur for RRMS? I'm trying to make so many big life decisions and the moment and I find that the easiest way to do that is by looking at some hard numbers! For example, if there's 25% chance that I, a 30 year old woman with RRMS, won't be able to walk in 10 years - maybe I should quit my job and travel the world while I can. But if it's 15%, not so likely. When I google these things, I'm seeing a pretty wide variety of numbers and I don't know what source to trust. Btw, I know and understand it's different for everyone and there's absolutely no way to predict anything. But if some overall statistics exist somewhere... that'd be a measuring stick to consider, at least. 	1	1	Statistics|and|Percentages	Does|anyone|have|a|link|to|good|graph|/|s|that|shows|the|statistical|likelihood|various|MS|related|disabilities|?|For|example|...|what|percentage|of|people|end|up|using|a|cane|?|How|about|using|a|wheelchair|?|How|about|blindness|?|And|at|about|what|ages|on|average|to|might|these|disabilities|occur|for|RRMS|?|I'm|trying|to|make|so|many|big|life|decisions|and|the|moment|and|I|find|that|the|easiest|way|to|do|that|is|by|looking|at|some|hard|numbers|!|For|example|,|if|there's|25|%|chance|that|I|,|a|30|year|old|woman|with|RRMS|,|won't|be|able|to|walk|in|10|years|-|maybe|I|should|quit|my|job|and|travel|the|world|while|I|can|.|But|if|it's|15|%|,|not|so|likely|.|When|I|google|these|things|,|I'm|seeing|a|pretty|wide|variety|of|numbers|and|I|don't|know|what|source|to|trust|.|Btw|,|I|know|and|understand|it's|different|for|everyone|and|there's|absolutely|no|way|to|predict|anything|.|But|if|some|overall|statistics|exist|somewhere|...|that'd|be|a|measuring|stick|to|consider|,|at|least|.

My eye specialist who ordered the MRI has kept things pretty vague and has told me that my results came back abnormal but hasn't given me a lot of info beyond that, other than I need to wait and talk to the Neurologist and get the Lumbar Puncture. I'm currently waiting for referrals to go through to book that and now am trying to decipher my written results ( I have not received any photos yet). I've started to make sense of some of the terminology but was wondering how the number of lesions is classified, any help would be greatly appreciated. My results read ""Greater than 10 supratentorial T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions."" How is the numbering system broken down? Are the lesions individually numbered until 10 and then after that results are just read greater than 10? Is the numbering system ordered by greater than 10, greater than 20, greater than 30, etc?   I'm sorry if I am not going a great job of explaining my numbering question. I'm trying to get a ballpark idea of how many lesions I have.

Small background on me, I've been diagnosed since I was 18 (in August of 2010) and I'm currently 27. I was diagnosed RRMS very quickly after my initial symptoms (numbness) and started rebif. The rebif has worked amazing and I've been stable without a relapse since diagnosis. Sometimes I get minor flares, and symptoms act up in heat or when I'm tired. But for the most part I've been stable THANKFULLY. lately I've just been getting anxious, I know there are so many new meds available...... should I be fighting more aggressively? Rebif was one of my only options in 2010 (that I was made aware of) but now there are so many more. Should I be more aggressive to make sure I have the best chance in the future? I'm not sure, if it's not broken don't fix it right? Is there anyone else still on rebif or one of the CRAB drugs rather than the newer ones? 	1	1	If|my|med|is|working|,|should|I|switch|?

This had occurred once about a year prior to my ending up at the doctor for it. The blood test had come back clean, so I was sent to do an MRI with and without contrast.   I just got my MRI results a few days ago and was told I have some lesions that lit up with the contrast fluid and other older lesions, and the doctor told me it was either MS or some other trauma. I'm going to a neurologist in a little over a week and am a little freaked out. I got super stressed after I got that phone call and have been exhausted/sleepy/had a relapse in double vision and a bothersome headache right behind my left eye.

I have even talked to people that their significant others have shamed them for ""staying home"" in pain and even for the medication that they take.

I'm as of yet formally diagnosed with neither, but have a 'holding diagnosis' of 'probable MS' after 4 years and numerous investigations. Whilst this has all been going down re APS I've also been experiencing painful, electric type numbness and insane dizziness. The last time I was this exhausted, I was told it was CIS / 'relapse' of MS yet to be formally diagnosed. APS and MS can exist together, but even the neurologic subset of APS is rare. Even so, both makes sense what with my family history of stroke, and my history of CIS. I came home from the hospitial and just felt kinda sad and maybe angry. I made a GP appointment to discuss what I feel re new weird numbness and dizziness.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4683553832467232899/My-wife's-advice-on-her-MS	My wife's advice on her MS	"This was posted by my wife on Facebook at [https://www.facebook.com/608347299362564/posts/943716245825666/](https://www.facebook.com/608347299362564/posts/943716245825666/) I wanted to share it here. An old friend texted me today. They asked me questions in regard to their family member who was diagnosed with MS a short time after I was. Their family member is having a number of problems. As I started to write back I realized my response might be good to share. This is what I wrote: That's a tough question. Not everyone is the same. With all of the things that MS can cause, that's how many different combinations there are of possibilities. Additionally, you have to consider what type of MS they have. I have RRMS which stands for Remitting Relapsing MS. There are other more aggressive forms referred to as Progressive MS whether secondary, primary or relapsing so you see I can't tell you for sure what to do. But.. just as a rule of thumb here's my general advice. First, ask the neurologist. If he's worth his salt by this time he's already done a follow-up MRI after having them on an MS med for a year or so. If they're not responding well to the med, try another. Bear in mind, these meds not only have their own side effects to contend with but are extremely slow to help the patient feel better. I mean likes ""months"" to ""years"". Secondly, stay as healthy as possible. No smoking, keep a healthy weight, all the common sense stuff. If they're taking pain meds they're probably making the constipation unbearable. I don't take anything stronger than my 800 mg of Ibuprofen for just that reason. If they have an addicting nature (drugs or alcohol) then, they won't be able to do what I do. I self-medicate by adding a glass of red wine to my Ibuprofen plus (if it's really bad) a flexoril and/or valium or two. Be very careful to use only the minimum needed. MS is a lifetime disease. If we use too many relieving type meds our bodies will become desensitized to them and we won't have anything that works in years to come when it gets bad, because let's face it, we're not ever going to be normal again. As for being able to pee that hasn't been my problem really. My problem was primarily control. Turns out I was having bladder spasms for 20 years and didn't know - - oof. A pill fixed that. I have almost perfect control now. YAY! First time in over 20 years! You have no idea how great having that little - natural - toddler accomplishment of self-control feels. Whew! But, I do still have the issue that my bladder will not empty completely unless I push like I'm giving birth. I've gotten pretty good at it too. Lol Now, according to the urologist, I'm able to empty my bladder almost completely. Leaving about 15 to 30 cc in the bladder is normal. I was under 5. Ha-ha. As for the bowels, Miralax works when all else fails for me. There's also Senna and Docusate Sodium along with Fiber Gummies. That's been my recipe. Now I'm weaning myself off as many of those as possible but it's a process. I was taking 2 Senna, 4 Docusate Sodium, 2 Fiber Gummies plus Miralax 3 times a day. Currently I'm taking 2 Docusate Sodium, 1 Senna, 2 Fiber Gummies and no Miralax. So, it is getting better until it doesn't again. I suppose my advice overall is treat it palliatively. The current symptoms may improve. Not all, but some. Treat those. Let the neurologist treat the MS. The patient has to use common sense and their primary to treat the rest. I'm not at all happy with my primary. I've been with him for over 20 years now. I only use him because I have to have someone that can do the referrals to specialists and keep a record of my meds. That's about all I use him for. He's a go between for me and the insurance company, if you will. I really want a better doctor but we seem to have a shortage of good doctors to patients these days. As for temper, that can be part of it, too. I went through a few years where my husband should've left me but didn't. (How did I get so lucky?) We thought at the time it was just menopause. I had the lab work done and the tests came back positive for menopause. Knew that! But I felt it was more than that. I asked dr for a script of valium to deal with the outbursts. That was only a few months before my stint in the hospital. Once we had the MS diagnosis I learned what effect it could have on my brain. (Think puberty and menopause put together. Oof! Scary creature.) Like most things I didn't have any control over it. After I found out how MS could affect my emotions I was much more able to deal with it. I still take Valium though not nearly as often and now I take it to help with other MS symptoms. Knowing what was causing the problem has allowed me to address it. It's been an education and I've come a long way since that. I haven't had a real argument with my husband in many, many months. They used to be several times a month. Knowing what the problem was has helped me figure out what to do about it. Whereas before I was stuck, alone and frustrated; I was told I was difficult and going through the changes of life. That I was growing older and had had kids so I would of course lose my bladder control, that it was normal. I was being labeled a hypochondriac and the doctor suggested psychological support. I was nuts. I knew I wasn't normal and no one took the time to help me figure out what was wrong until I landed in the hospital. The first time I went to my primary for follow up after the hospital stint I told him I came this close to wearing a sign around my neck to my appointment that read ""I TOLD YOU I WAS SICK"". I finally felt vindicated. All those years I hadn't been correctly diagnosed. I was losing my mind but not to insanity. Rather, I was losing my brain to a physical disease. As devastating as it was to find out that I had this disease I finally had something to celebrate. I think that made a huge difference in how I've dealt with my illness. Encourage your family member to celebrate the little things. Being able to stand on their own if they couldn't yesterday, remember the shopping list, being able to use the bathroom…. that sort of thing. Being able to do anything on their own today that they couldn't yesterday. It's important to stay positive. Without positivity they'll become depressed, lose ambition and go down a rabbit hole that's hard to get out of. As insidious as MS is it's important to find reasons to keep going. It's too easy to consider the alternative. Finding happiness is tough when every day you wake up feeling like you're gonna walk through mud all day again today. Every little thing is a struggle. Even smiling is a struggle for me. I've always been self conscious so for my smile to be lopsided is a concern for me. I have to do stretching and other exercises when posing for selfies to smile on both sides. Even then, it's a chore. ...Every little thing is a chore. For someone with MS, just being alive can be a chore. I hope I've given you something you can use. It would be nice to know if I did. I have to look for the good I do as a source of positivity. Good luck and let me know if you have any other questions.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4683376889851859839/Tips-on-how-to-deal-with-urinary-incontinencehyper-sensible-bladder?	Tips on how to deal with urinary incontinence/hyper sensible bladder?	"Hi! My girlfriend, 22yo, was diagnosed with MS around April of this year. She's being treated since July (I might be off on the dates, I don't remember the exact dates) with Natalizumab once a month. Her main symptoms affecting her are fatigue and urinary incontinence/hyper sensible bladder. She started by peeing in bed from time to time. It actually started before she was diagnosed, during a time where an ex of her was basically stalking her and being a fucking grade A creep. She was under heavy stress for a while and one night she ended up wetting herself. It didn't happen for a while but eventually it would happen again.   Her neurologist gave her ADT and another drug that I don't recall right now, with the intent of preventing this from happening again... but eventually it did happen.   That was ""OK"" since it only happen once in a while... but it still took a toll on her, since ""only babies wet their beds"". It also made her super nervous when she had to sleep over at a friend's place...so she stopped going to those events.   The worst happened in the last two weeks but I'll get to it in a bit.   In the meantime (from diagnosis until now) she finished her Physics Degree and enrolled in a Computational Mathematics Masters. It's going reasonably well but the fatigue and the occasional days long ""mind fog"" leaves her super frustrated and sad. It's worsened due to her ""inability"" of letting go of work. She hates not pulling her weight and some more, so instead of going home in the end of the day to get some rest, it's not unusual for her to stay at Uni and keep on working. This eventually results in her being extremely tired. It's made worse by some group colleagues that she has that are beyond incompetent. With the stress building up, her hyper sensible bladder cranked it self up to eleven. She has go to to the toilet every 20 mins almost. This is obviously a pain in the butt, so she appointed a meeting with a urologist, who proceeded to performed an Cystoscopy on her and he also gave her Emselex to take. This was two weeks ago   It was around this time that eventually IT happened. We were coming back from the caffee to her place after a cup of coffee when she felt a sudden urge to pee. It was ok, we thought, we are literally a minute from home... but it was too strong and she peed herself out in the street. This is what she most feared coming true. I managed to bring her to a small alley and tried to comfort her as best as I could (Well... what could I do really? :( ) while she just cried for a long while. She was super ashamed of herself, she could barely bring herself look at me. We eventually got back home, had a bath together and some cuddling time there after.   Luckly, we thought, two days from that she managed to go to the pharmacy to buy the Emselex the doctor ordered (it's 40 fucking euros for a single box by the way!! What the fuck is this?!). She started to take the pills.   The past week, her bladder started to hurt, and is still cranked at 11. We are unsure if it's from the medication or the cystoscopy. This left her super nervous and stress everytime she had to go out, since she had the urges to pee very frequently and some of them were quite strong. Luckly 9/10 times she finds a bathroom... but there's the 1/10 time she does not.   This past Sunday she had her appointment in the hospital for another round of natalizumab. Unfortunately her doctor wasn't there, but she still told the nurses what's happening to her. They said that they couldn't do anything since it's not their job. The redirected her to another neurologist that was in service... which promptly sent her to the Urology since she's not her patient. When she got to the Urology they said that it's not their job, and said for her to to go back to the Neurology. Her neurologist said that she's only available to met my GF in January 13. Fucking public hospitals...   This has destroyed her confidence, and it's making her depressed very quickly. She now tries to leave the house as fewer times as possible. She's fearing that she won't be able to do the things she did before. She's only 22 yo. It was not expected for this to happen so soon, and this fast. Thinking of using diapers only leaves her even sadder. She always putted a lot of effort in the clothes she wore, and using a bulky diaper sucks, since it will be difficult to hide. And there's also the fact that her pants/skirts usually are tight, so she would have to buy new clothes that are a bit looser for the diaper to fit. This is money we don't have.   I want to help her get her life back, or parts of it back. I want to see her happy again and not find her crying everyday. She's only 22 and she already as taken some pretty big blows. I fear for the state we will find her in 20-30 years. I want to help her as most as I can but I don't know what to do.... and the helplessness leaves me sad as well. I really love her and I want to make my life with her... Is there any hope in recovery? Even if partial? Do you guys have any tips? I'm sorry if my writing is super confusing, please tell if I need to clarify things.   Thank you all for you time <3 EDIT: Forgot to say, she managed to get an appointment on a nutritionist she followed for a while and really liked. Turns out that the diet she got is SUPER restricted, she pretty much only eats vegetables and hake, leaving out any kind of ""tasty food"", takes a considerable amount of time to prepare and ends up being considerably more expensive than what she usually ate. This also does not help her mental state. "	1	1	Tips|on|how|to|deal|with|urinary|incontinence|/|hyper|sensible|bladder|?

Im sure this kind of post is one you see all the time, so forgive me if it is. My doctor recently expressed some concerns about the possibility of MS and is sending me to a neurologist and I am just curious as to what some of the first symptoms you all noticed were, and what are some of the symptoms you experience now? Of course I have googled and read the common ones ""fatigue, muscle spams, etc"" but it always seems more realistic when I see exactly how these manifest (for example, when I read muscle spasm on WebMD that is very different than someone telling me they experienced reoccurring arm spasms every night, etc.).

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4683140957015599651/My-aunt-50f-says-I-27f-don't-really-have-MS.	My aunt (50f) says I (27f) don't really have MS.	Hi everyone! I'm newly DXd. First MRI was in September, for something unrelated and we found that I had lesions consistent with MS, then the dreaded LP Nov 19th and been having some issues with my eye the last few months, and I'm about to start taking Tecfidera. Its been a rollercoaster of emotions. This year I made huge positive changes in my life and out of nowhere this happens. I'm a somewhat private person, I haven't told many people about what's been going on but my mom has a twin sister who has progressive MS, and is always concerned about my mom and encourages her to get tested. So, I went to her for advice, I even started seeing the same neurologist as her and read some books she recommended. I felt like we could lean on each other. Today, I called my mom, and found out my Aunt has been saying Im lying and don't really have MS. I'm pissed off and sad at the same time, I thought she would understand more than anyone what I'm going through. My aunt is an alcoholic who is known for saying mean things, and I dont want to lay into her and cause more tension between her and my mom. I just told my mom that MS has a funny way of making people pissed off at the world, and that it didn't bother me. Has anyone else had an experience like this? What did you do? Who do you turn to for support when people around you don't understand? tl;dr: my aunt is an alcoholic with primary progressive MS, I'm newly diagnosed woth rrms and went to her for support but found out she's been telling my mom I'm full of shit and don't really have MS. Thanks in advance, as much as it sucks we find ourselves here, im happy to be able to lurk this sub the last few months and I look forward to contributing more constructively in the future. 	1	0	My|aunt|(|50f|)|says|I|(|27f|)|don't|really|have|MS|.

It's pretty hard to eat, and I need to make sure I eat because i'm breastfeeding. I have had quite a few GI issues since I was younger, but this started happening more as I got my ""Nerve pain episodes""   So I was wondering if people diagnosed with MS had similar experiences and what helps you?

The worst thing is the seeing double part. I wear an eyepatch in order to cover my problematic eye and only then can I see a normal picture, so normally I became a laughing matter in school and it really is messing with my life.

Preamble: I was diagnosed last year with RRMS (though had undiagnosed symptoms for around 10ish years), and was put on copaxone initially but was switched to ocrevus in April due to side effects. I have however noticed a strange sensation in my skull (as best as I can estimate) that feels similar to a throat tickle, occasional near dizziness (usually at the same time as and intensifying the previous effect), and my knee has taken a liking to occasionally becoming prone to buckling in episodes lasting 5-10 minutes every few weeks. After seeing all the benefits of ocrevus that people report I'm afraid that I might be making a mountain of a mole hill with these recent issues, especially after my most recent MRI's didn't show any new legions.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4682525185867712988/Fasting	Fasting	I've been doing a lot of research into fasting to help with the brain fog over the last few weeks. It all seems early but very positive, lots of amazing reviews. A relative has diabetes and has seen a dramatic change in his life from a very simple fasting diet so that's given me some hope that it might have similar effects with my MS. The plan I was looking at was 8:16. So essentially no food at all until lunch, then 8 hours to have lunch and dinner then a 16 hour fast before my next meal.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4682197223475807386/MRI-one-year-after-first-Lemtrada-dose	MRI one year after first Lemtrada dose	I'm a bit lost for words. My first year of MS (Aubagio) was spilled with a few flair-ups as well as secondary effects. I switched to Lemtrada last Christmas and I didn't have any symptom whatsoever since then. The results of my MRI aren't so favourable, tho. Appearently my neck is much better but I got 5 new lesions in my brain. It was like a glass of cold water thrown to my face. Since midterms are approaching, my nerves didn't really need much to get the best of me, so this has basically killed any will to study or doing anything that is not staying in bed. I'm sorry about the rant. I needed to vent. 	1	1	MRI|one|year|after|first|Lemtrada|dose	I'm|a|bit|lost|for|words|.|My|first|year|of|MS|(|Aubagio|)|was|spilled|with|a|few|flair-ups|as|well|as|secondary|effects|.|I|switched|to|Lemtrada|last|Christmas|and|I|didn't|have|any|symptom|whatsoever|since|then|.|The|results|of|my|MRI|aren't|so|favourable|,|tho|.|Appearently|my|neck|is|much|better|but|I|got|5|new|lesions|in|my|brain|.|It|was|like|a|glass|of|cold|water|thrown|to|my|face|.|Since|midterms|are|approaching|,|my|nerves|didn't|really|need|much|to|get|the|best|of|me|,|so|this|has|basically|killed|any|will|to|study|or|doing|anything|that|is|not|staying|in|bed|.|I'm|sorry|about|the|rant|.|I|needed|to|vent|.

However I wasn't ready for it. This isn't the first time it has happen however it is the first time in public. I went today to go holiday shopping at Walmart. When I arrived I went to the bathroom to pee and then went to the greeting card section. Well apparently my body didn't want to go there and wasn't going to listen to me when all of a sudden I felt the need to go to the bathroom. It was too late. So now I am standing emptying everything. I am happy to have been wearing jeans but at the same time I now have to walk in shame to the bathroom to try and control what happen. Once I get to the bathroom and lower pants it's too far gone to even try to fix. I wipe and wipe and wipe with no help. So now I'm crying with no solution in a Walmart while people are complaining about the smell and how there is stuff on the floor. I text my boyfriend in shame to rescue me but now there really is no point in me changing clothes since I'm completely covered. The poor man comes to my rescue and now I have to walk in shame to his car as he drives me home to clean up and cry for hours. I'm so upset. MS sucks I haven't been able to eat after it happen. I was suppose to make dinner but instead I'm here crying. Sorry for the rant. I hope everyone else had a better Sunday. 	1	1	Sadness|is|my|emotion|for|today	So|I|knew|ever|since|they|diagnosed|me|that|eventually|I|would|lose|function|.|However|I|wasn't|ready|for|it|.|This|isn't|the|first|time|it|has|happen|however|it|is|the|first|time|in|public|.|I|went|today|to|go|holiday|shopping|at|Walmart|.|When|I|arrived|I|went|to|the|bathroom|to|pee|and|then|went|to|the|greeting|card|section|.|Well|apparently|my|body|didn't|want|to|go|there|and|wasn't|going|to|listen|to|me|when|all|of|a|sudden|I|felt|the|need|to|go|to|the|bathroom|.|It|was|too|late|.|So|now|I|am|standing|emptying|everything|.|I|am|happy|to|have|been|wearing|jeans|but|at|the|same|time|I|now|have|to|walk|in|shame|to|the|bathroom|to|try|and|control|what|happen|.|Once|I|get|to|the|bathroom|and|lower|pants|it's|too|far|gone|to|even|try|to|fix|.|I|wipe|and|wipe|and|wipe|with|no|help|.|So|now|I'm|crying|with|no|solution|in|a|Walmart|while|people|are|complaining|about|the|smell|and|how|there|is|stuff|on|the|floor|.|I|text|my|boyfriend|in|shame|to|rescue|me|but|now|there|really|is|no|point|in|me|changing|clothes|since|I'm|completely|covered|.|The|poor|man|comes|to|my|rescue|and|now|I|have|to|walk|in|shame|to|his|car|as|he|drives|me|home|to|clean|up|and|cry|for|hours|.|I'm|so|upset|.|MS|sucks|I|haven't|been|able|to|eat|after|it|happen|.|I|was|suppose|to|make|dinner|but|instead|I'm|here|crying|.|Sorry|for|the|rant|.|I|hope|everyone|else|had|a|better|Sunday|.

Parkinson’s Patients Preparing For ‘Breakthrough’ Clinical Trial To Reverse Symptoms (via brain cell transplant). *If successful, induced pluripotent stem cells could also potentially treat multiple sclerosis, ALS, Alzheimer’s and other neurological disorders that currently have no cure.	"i don't think I've read about this before. i highlighted what i thought were the most important points in bold - super intriguing points in there. ***** SOURCE: https://www.kpbs.org/news/2018/nov/02/parkinsons-patients-preparing-brain-cell-replaceme/ Parkinson's Patients Preparing For ‘Breakthrough' Clinical Trial To Reverse Symptoms Friday, November 2, 2018 By Susan Murphy A walk in the park can be exhausting for Chris Whitmer. His once athletic stride has been weakened by Parkinson's disease. “Outwardly, you probably notice the tremors the most. You know, the shaking, the stiffness, how somebody walks,” said Whitmer, 58, a married, father of two. “The biggest thing I feel is the fatigue,” he said. “It just makes you extremely tired.” Over the past dozen years, his symptoms have progressed. The disease is not fatal but it can leave a person completely debilitated. “I don't want to think about what I'll be like 10 years from now, and what it's going to feel like. I want to be around for my kids,” he said, choking back tears. Parkinson's symptoms generally include tremors or shaking, weak or aching muscles, and difficulty walking and speaking, along with depression or apathy. While some symptoms can be eased for a while with medication, there is currently no cure. **Whitmer's cells from his skin are his biggest hope. The former tech industry businessman is one of 10 people preparing to undergo a brain cell transplant in San Diego as part of a first-of-its-kind clinical trial.** “I think it's going to be the first successful treatment of Parkinson's because everything we've done to now with drugs and therapies and deep brain stimulation... just treats the symptoms,” he explained. “This will be the first treatment, I think, that will reverse the symptoms.” If all goes well, his health will be restored, within months. **Replacing Brain Cells To Reverse Symptoms** **Parkinson's kills brain cells that make a substance called dopamine. Dopamine allows nerve cells to communicate with muscles.** **“So what we propose to do is replace those neurons in the brain with the people's own dopamine neurons,” said Jeanne Loring, a stem cell scientist with Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla.** **The process starts with taking a small skin biopsy from a patient's arm. The skin cells are transformed into master cells called “induced pluripotent stem cells,” which can make any cell or tissue in the body, including neurons. The cells can also regenerate themselves.** **“The reason pluripotent stem cells are so important is that unlike the stem cells living in your body right now — they are cells that can regenerate certain parts of your body, not very well — these cells can make every cell type in the body including nerve cells,” Loring said.** **Loring has mastered the procedure of turning pluripotent stem cells into dopamine neurons. She said other researchers are trying a similar approach, but they are using embryonic stem cells or other cells that are not from the patient.** **“The difference between our group, what we're planning and the others, is that we're the only ones using a person's own cells,” Loring emphasized.** **“It's reasonable to hope right now,” she said. ""We expect to start seeing some improvements in the patients, maybe 6 months or certainly by a year.""** **Loring's experiment, more than 5 years in the making, has been successfully tested in animals. The project is currently under review by the FDA.** **If all goes well during the first trial in 2019, she hopes to expand the treatment to a large number of patients soon after.** **“Stem cell replacement therapy is a reality that's going to become a much more, a much larger part of medicine over the next few years,” Loring said.** Building A Foundation Getting Loring's research to a potential clinical trial has involved climbing mountains for fundraising, opening a new lab in Torrey Pines to reduce overhead costs and starting a foundation to secure grants and donations. “It feels like we're on a freight train now on a downward slope sliding into FDA approval for the clinical trials,” said Jenifer Raub, director of the Summit For Stem Cell Foundation. The nonprofit was created in 2011 to back the project with a collaboration of patients, researchers, doctors and donors. Raub, 60, is also a Parkinson's patient and clinical trial participant. She recalled when her doctor diagnosed her disease 12 years ago. “I didn't believe it. I told him he was crazy and I walked out,” she chuckled. But the disease has taken a toll, she said. “You find yourself slowing down to the point of not being able to move at all,” Raub said. Still, she's filled with hope that she'll soon be able to enjoy life's simple pleasures once again. “Playing with my grandkids and working in the yard,” she said, holding back tears. It's that hope that gets her up at 4 a.m. every day working to secure grants, organizing fundraising events and answering emails from hundreds of other Parkinson's patients wanting to participate in a clinical trial. Years ago when she applied for the trial, she had some anxiety, she said. But now, there's no doubt in her mind the neuron replacement therapy will work. “It's genetically screened multiple times. It's it. It's the answer,” Raub said. “It's going to be super exciting to have an answer for the outcry of 7 to 10 million people worldwide.” **Moving the Needle of Scientific Discovery** **The project has drawn interest from researchers around world, including some top institutes in San Diego County. If successful, induced pluripotent stem cells could also potentially treat multiple sclerosis, ALS, Alzheimer's and other neurological disorders that currently have no cure.** Stephen Wilson, executive vice president of the La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology, recently reviewed Loring's research and visited her lab. “As a scientist who tends to root myself in skepticism and careful observation, I'd be lying if I didn't say I'm extremely hopeful,” Wilson said. “I really want it to work.” Wilson's team, focused on preventing disease through a better understanding of the immune system, is studying the role of autoimmunity in Parkinson's disease. “Great science loves great scientist neighbors,” he said. “It's never the case anymore that a single person in a room all by themselves has this Eureka moment and figures it all out A to Z. There are pieces that your work is going to explain and then gaps that you're hoping that in parallel someone else can factor.” Wilson said the project could move the needle of scientific discovery. “There are some great treatments, there are a lot of trials in all these different areas but this is one of those big ones where it could just suddenly change it for the better,” he said. “This truly is pioneering work,” Wilson said. “We're going to find out how well it works, and we're all going to have to collectively hold our breath a bit because we want it to work.” No one wants it to work more than Chris Whitmer. He's hoping his walk in life will get easier. Because if it does, others with Parkinson's could soon follow in his footsteps.

"when i was diagnosed with MS it was late 2011. ...there weren't nearly as many ms drugs available as there are today, and more are in the pipeline as we speak. not to oversimplify - they come with side effects and i expect it will take trial and error to find the right one, but it's still good news that we have more options. ...uber pool wasn't invented yet, so i thought ""how am i going to get around affordably?"" i live in a city and don't have a car. having a cheaper option to get around starting in 2014 was a lifesaver. ...tinder wasn't invented yet. when i was diagnosed, i thought maybe i'd never have a relationship, because who would want ""damaged goods"" like me. three years later i met my husband. on tinder... which wasn't invented until 2012, a year after i was diagnosed. if tinder had not been invented, i can pretty much guarantee that our paths would never have crossed. ms is a pain in the ass in our relationship so we are not pooping unicorns and daisies, but still. ...alexa wasn't invented yet. now i can say alexa tv on, tv off, lights on, lights off, etc. it's nice. ...i didn't know about accessaride (nyc). speaking of that, now access a ride has a pilot program apparently so you don't have to order a ride a day in advance. a little late to the party but i just applied, and if approved, i expect it to be yet another gamechanger. one of the main reasons i don't go out is getting to the subway and dealing with the stairs is a beech. soon i hope i won't have to deal with it and will go out far more often, thanks to this program. time will tell. not knowing about this program until this year - that really made me lose hope, thinking id be stuck at home bc i didn't want to deal with the subway and was spending too much on uber pools - until someone on this sub told me about it. ...virtual reality afaik wasn't accessible for home use, so ...now there are more fun things to do at home :-) ...i didn't know about reddit (well i'd heard of it, but never went on it bc i really thought it was the dark web or something). the things i've learned on a few subs here, including this one, have absolutely, tangibly changed my life for the better. i wonder what changes we will see in the next 7 years. i wonder how have things changed for you in the past decade or so?

I have an appointment in one week. The specialist doctor keeps saying that he is not worried and that everything looks fine. The MRi looks fine, the one with contrast looks fine. My vision looks fine. My balance and strenght looks fine. And I do believe him. Then I get the letter from the hospital that is sent to my physician. It says that I have three lesions and that MS can not be excluded. I don't really understand. Is that not cause for worry? I imagine that the specialist is going to tell me that I dont have any activity right now and to live my life as normal. Maybe he'll say that we will have to wait and see if I develop more symptoms?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4681253506262061989/CDC-Launching-National-Neurological-Conditions-Surveillance-System-to-Study-MS	CDC Launching National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System to Study MS	CDC Launching National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System to Study MS https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/11/30/cdc-launches-national-surveillance-system-to-study-multiple-sclerosis/ NOVEMBER 30, 2018 BY ALBERTO MOLANO IN NEWS. The U.S. Congress is supporting with $5 million the National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System (NNCSS), an initiative to be launched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help researchers better understand who develops neurological disorders and why. The NNCSS was authorized by Congress as a part of the 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law Dec. 13, 2016, but was not funded until fiscal year 2019 when the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education spending bill was signed in September. Funding and implementing the NNCSS has been a priority of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The surveillance system will focus initially on two diseases, multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease, and will serve as demonstration projects to help the CDC determine which areas are most affected by neurological conditions. The purpose of NNCSS is to expand surveillance of neurological conditions. With improved data collection, it may be possible, for instance, to identify environmental or viral triggers of MS. “I can't help but wonder if my daughter will hear ‘you have MS' someday; my current neurologist says that her chance is 1 in 40. Without real, current data, MS researchers have difficulty identifying and pursuing potential leads of environmental or viral triggers for MS,” Rebecca, a MS patient from Detroit said in a MS Society press release. Rebecca was diagnosed in 2013; her father also has MS. The NNCSS will build on the success of the MS Society Prevalence Initiative, launched in 2014, with leading experts in MS epidemiology, statistics and healthcare, who utilized information from Medicare, Medicaid, the Veteran's Health Administration, and private insurers to determine the number of people in the U.S. affected by MS. Preliminary results from that study indicated that nearly 1 million people in the U.S. have MS, more than twice the previously reported number. “The information gleaned from the Society's prevalence initiative combined with the data from the NNCSS will help us better understand multiple sclerosis – who gets it and possible reasons why,” said Bari Talente, the society's executive vice president of advocacy. “We look forward to working with the CDC to make sure the NNCSS collects information on incidence, age, race, ethnicity data, as well as geographic data that can help refine and target research we hope will lead to a cure,” Talente said. edit: more info Neurological Conditions Surveillance System https://www. cdc. gov/surveillance/projects/nncss/index.html National MS Society link - looks like this was the request and described how the NNCSS will help. i like this link much better than above link, which uses too vague language for my taste. https://www.nationalmssociety.org/NationalMSSociety/media/MSNationalFiles/Advocacy/2017-PPC-Neuro-Data-Leavebehind. pdf? ext=.pdf. 	1	0	CDC|Launching|National|Neurological|Conditions|Surveillance|System|to|Study|MS	CDC|Launching|National|Neurological|Conditions|Surveillance|System|to|Study|MS|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/11/30/cdc-launches-national-surveillance-system-to-study-multiple-sclerosis/|NOVEMBER|30|,|2018|BY|ALBERTO|MOLANO|IN|NEWS|.|The|U|.|S|.|Congress|is|supporting|with|$|5|million|the|National|Neurological|Conditions|Surveillance|System|(|NNCSS|)|,|an|initiative|to|be|launched|by|the|Centers|for|Disease|Control|and|Prevention|(|CDC|)|to|help|researchers|better|understand|who|develops|neurological|disorders|and|why|.|The|NNCSS|was|authorized|by|Congress|as|a|part|of|the|21st|Century|Cures|Act|,|signed|into|law|Dec|.|13|,|2016|,|but|was|not|funded|until|fiscal|year|2019|when|the|Labor|,|Health|and|Human|Services|,|and|Education|spending|bill|was|signed|in|September|.|Funding|and|implementing|the|NNCSS|has|been|a|priority|of|the|National|Multiple|Sclerosis|Society|.|The|surveillance|system|will|focus|initially|on|two|diseases|,|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|and|Parkinson's|disease|,|and|will|serve|as|demonstration|projects|to|help|the|CDC|determine|which|areas|are|most|affected|by|neurological|conditions|.|The|purpose|of|NNCSS|is|to|expand|surveillance|of|neurological|conditions|.|With|improved|data|collection|,|it|may|be|possible|,|for|instance|,|to|identify|environmental|or|viral|triggers|of|MS|.|“|I|can't|help|but|wonder|if|my|daughter|will|hear|‘|you|have|MS|'|someday|;|my|current|neurologist|says|that|her|chance|is|1|in|40|.|Without|real|,|current|data|,|MS|researchers|have|difficulty|identifying|and|pursuing|potential|leads|of|environmental|or|viral|triggers|for|MS|,|”|Rebecca|,|a|MS|patient|from|Detroit|said|in|a|MS|Society|press|release|.|Rebecca|was|diagnosed|in|2013|;|her|father|also|has|MS|.|The|NNCSS|will|build|on|the|success|of|the|MS|Society|Prevalence|Initiative|,|launched|in|2014|,|with|leading|experts|in|MS|epidemiology|,|statistics|and|healthcare|,|who|utilized|information|from|Medicare|,|Medicaid|,|the|Veteran's|Health|Administration|,|and|private|insurers|to|determine|the|number|of|people|in|the|U|.|S|.|affected|by|MS|.|Preliminary|results|from|that|study|indicated|that|nearly|1|million|people|in|the|U|.|S|.|have|MS|,|more|than|twice|the|previously|reported|number|.|“|The|information|gleaned|from|the|Society's|prevalence|initiative|combined|with|the|data|from|the|NNCSS|will|help|us|better|understand|multiple|sclerosis|–|who|gets|it|and|possible|reasons|why|,|”|said|Bari|Talente|,|the|society's|executive|vice|president|of|advocacy|.|“|We|look|forward|to|working|with|the|CDC|to|make|sure|the|NNCSS|collects|information|on|incidence|,|age|,|race|,|ethnicity|data|,|as|well|as|geographic|data|that|can|help|refine|and|target|research|we|hope|will|lead|to|a|cure|,|”|Talente|said|.|edit|:|more|info|Neurological|Conditions|Surveillance|System|https://www|.|cdc|.|gov|/|surveillance|/|projects|/|nncss|/|index.html|National|MS|Society|link|-|looks|like|this|was|the|request|and|described|how|the|NNCSS|will|help|.|i|like|this|link|much|better|than|above|link|,|which|uses|too|vague|language|for|my|taste|.|https://www.nationalmssociety.org/NationalMSSociety/media/MSNationalFiles/Advocacy/2017-PPC-Neuro-Data-Leavebehind|.|pdf|?|ext|=|.|pdf|.

Brother (40m - PPMS, dx'd 5 years ago) seems to have withdrawn from life, any advice to pull him back?	Hi all! Coming to you guys for advice.   tl;dr: brothers symptoms seem to be worsening, he's waiting for disability hearing, doesn't have any social circle except our mom and myself, doesn't have any excess cash. He has basically withdrawn from everything he used to do, and hasn't really replaced the old activities with anything new besides going to the doctor. Depression seems to be worsening. How do I help him see the light that even if life is different than it used to be, it can still be good?   BG info: Brother, 40, diagnosed w/ PPMS 5 years ago. Split from fiance 4 years ago, moved to a different state a month thereafter. Was briefly employed, but lost his job in Fall of 2016 and hasn't worked since. Has alienated himself from our extended family, and now only talks to our mom and myself. No real social network outside of the two of us. Applied for disability last year, got denied, appealed, and has a hearing set for the first part of next year. His symptoms (as he's told me) are fatigue, some numbness in his arm/hand, more recently a little unstable on his feet - trips more often, some recent frequent urination issues, cognitive issues. pre-diagnosis: workaholic, active, always rehabbing houses, working in garden, motorcycles. has always had some mental hangups due to growing up with an alcoholic mom and having not spoken to his father since he was 10. my dad adopted him, but their relationship isn't good.   So being one of the two people my brother talks to, I feel like I need to do something to help pull him out of the mental hole he's in right now. He's clearly depressed, and does see a psychiatrist and counselor, but he's basically alienated himself from the world. He lives in a very very small town (<1000 people) on a dirt road with bad internet and no cell reception. He gets out by either going grocery shopping, or going to the doctor. Other than that he doesn't have much of a social life. He was NOT like this 8 years ago.

I get tested every 3 months for low lymphocytes and they are always on the slightly lower end (14-15 from the recommended 19 minimum), but my neurologist always gave me the all-clear to continue the Tec. Lately, I've been having issues with balance and veering off to my left side when I walk. I have slight weakness in my left side and experience numbness in my leg and arm (just slightly but enough) and deal with worsening fatigue to the point of barely being able to function at work. I have also been having issues with speech and recalling words when talking at work and have a severe pain/tightening in my lower back and left shoulder. Mind you, I have always had this pain in my shoulder area (closer to my back) which partly lead to my MS diagnosis. I saw my neuro Monday and he's thinking it's a relapse and wants me to switch to Ocrevus after my MRI next Friday but now I'm worried. I've scoured the internet for some way to tell the difference between a relapse and PML symptoms but have come up empty handed.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4680899616895620851/Anyone-experienced-hearing-loss-andor-tinnitus-that-was-MS-related?	Anyone experienced hearing loss and/or tinnitus that was MS related?	Ok, so at the end of this August I started feeling some mild numbness and loss of the perception of temperature on the left side of my body. Doctors suspected MS and I was hospitalized and given steroids ( both Prednisone and Solu Medrol I think) for 7 days. During my time in the hospital I also had my first brain MRI which showed demyelinating lesions on my brain - the written report said multiple in various areas of my brain. I was then recommended to a new neurologist for further investigation. This doctor recommended to get a new MRI both brain and spine, and some blood work and told me to get in touch with her as soon as I had both blood work and MRI to schedule a lumbar punction as well. I had the second MRI on Nov 16th. This one lasted much longer than the first one, about an hour and a half and it was very uncomfortable - I kept feeling pain on the left side of my scalp, but the technician dismissed me and reprimanded me for not standing still. Right after the MRI I was left with tinnitus, but didn't think much of it. I thought it was just due to the prolonged noise exposure and it will pass soon. I had this MRI in the morning and as I was heading to work I noticed hearing loss in my right ear. I didn't think too much of it and figured it will pass soon, once I shook those MRI sounds. About a week later hearing in my right ear was almost all back, but tinnitus was still there, really loud, as well as certain frequencies' sensitivity (sounds seemed much louder than before). I also started having really intense vertigo and could barely stand up due to it. Hearing in my right ear was now back to normal and in turn I now experienced hearing loss in my left ear. I ended up going to the Emergency Room and I was once again hospitalized. Because it seems like I also had nystagmus on top of my vertigo and hearing loss, the doctor who treated my first symptoms (numbness) suspected it may be a flare up. I am now a few days into my steroids treatment and my vertigo has improved, but hearing loss and tinnitus still persist , although tinnitus may not be as loud as before. While my vertigo has improved I still experience it. I had a very brief ENT check up from a nurse and she only looked in one ear saying it looked fine. I have been reading a bit and it seems like hearing loss and tinnitus is rare with MS? Anyone experienced this? It is a bit confusing to me given that my hearing related issues all coincided with the MRI and yet at the time of my hospitalization I also had nystagmus. I would appreciate any advice and new perspective on this. I am sorry if it was long and hopefully I managed to articulate everything properly. 	1	1	Anyone|experienced|hearing|loss|and|/|or|tinnitus|that|was|MS|related|?

Since being at the middle school since late September, I've taken three sick days (one because I was normal people sick, the other two due to MS symptoms). Prior to today, I hadn't disclosed my illness to my cooperating teacher. I decided to tell him today because I'm fully teaching two periods and had to call out today, which is impacting my performance. He recommended looking into policies and resources for my future career and to establish a procedure for future days out. I need tips on how to do this!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4680545721946674207/more-progress:-Artificial-Intelligence-May-Help-Reduce-Dosage-of-Gadolinium-in-MRIs,-Researchers-Suggest	more progress: Artificial Intelligence May Help Reduce Dosage of Gadolinium in MRIs, Researchers Suggest	source: https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/11/28/artificial-intelligence-can-reduce-dosage-of-gadolinium-for-mri-scans/ Artificial Intelligence May Help Reduce Dosage of Gadolinium in MRIs, Researchers Suggest NOVEMBER 28, 2018 BY ALICE MELÃO IN NEWS. Artificial intelligence can help reduce the amount of gadolinium used as a contrast agent in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans, preventing the agent's potential toxicity when accumulated in body tissue, including the brain and bones, each time it is used, researchers suggest. The finding is of particular importance for patients with health conditions that require regular MRI assessments such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The data were reported in the study “Evaluation of Deep-Learning-Based Technology for Reducing Gadolinium Dosage in Contrast-Enhanced MRI Exams,” presented at the 104th Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Nov. 25-30 in Chicago. Gadolinium is a heavy metal commonly used as a contrast agent to enhance images collected by MRI scans. The use of gadolinium has been shown to be safe and improve MRI's diagnostic accuracy as it aids in the visualization of the body's internal structures. Gadolinium-enhanced scans are often used to visualize inflammation, tumors, and blood vessels. It has proven to be a powerful tool to diagnose several diseases, including MS. However, studies have recently shown that for each dose of gadolinium given, about 1% is retained in the tissues. The impact of this is still unknown, but researchers are working to minimize potential toxicity effects and optimize patient safety while preserving the diagnostic accuracy of MRI scans. “There is concrete evidence that gadolinium deposits in the brain and body,” Enhao Gong, PhD, a researcher at Stanford University and lead author of the study, said in a press release. “While the implications of this are unclear, mitigating potential patient risks while maximizing the clinical value of the MRI exams is imperative.” With this in mind, researchers explored the potential of artificial intelligence to help reduce the amount of gadolinium used in routine practice. The team reviewed the protocol and scan images of about 200 patients who had undergone contrast-enhanced MRI exams for several medical indications. They used deep learning — an artificial intelligence technique that teaches computers by example — to assess the data and compute an optimized protocol for gadolinium use. With this approach, the team could identify very small differences among images that would otherwise remain undetectable to the eye. The team collected three sets of images for each patient: one to define baseline values (before contrast administration), a low-dose scan (acquired after 10% of gadolinium dose had been administrated), and a full-dose scan (acquired after 100% of gadolinium dose had been administrated). Using the artificial intelligence-based analysis strategy, the team built a computer algorithm that could create images with similar quality as those obtained with full-dose contrast-enhanced MRI images. Researchers also demonstrated that it would be possible to create images with equivalent diagnostic quality to those obtained with full-dose contrast agent administration without really using any contrast enhancer compound. “We're not trying to replace existing imaging technology,” Gong said. “We're trying to improve it and generate more value from the existing information while looking out for the safety of our patients. Low-dose gadolinium images yield significant untapped, clinically useful information that is accessible now by using deep learning and [artificial intelligence].” Additional studies are still warranted to further explore the use of the algorithm across a broader range of MRI scanners and applied to different types of contrast agents. 	1	0	more|progress|:|Artificial|Intelligence|May|Help|Reduce|Dosage|of|Gadolinium|in|MRIs|,|Researchers|Suggest	source|:|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/11/28/artificial-intelligence-can-reduce-dosage-of-gadolinium-for-mri-scans/|Artificial|Intelligence|May|Help|Reduce|Dosage|of|Gadolinium|in|MRIs|,|Researchers|Suggest|NOVEMBER|28|,|2018|BY|ALICE|MELÃO|IN|NEWS|.|Artificial|intelligence|can|help|reduce|the|amount|of|gadolinium|used|as|a|contrast|agent|in|MRI|(|magnetic|resonance|imaging|)|scans|,|preventing|the|agent's|potential|toxicity|when|accumulated|in|body|tissue|,|including|the|brain|and|bones|,|each|time|it|is|used|,|researchers|suggest|.|The|finding|is|of|particular|importance|for|patients|with|health|conditions|that|require|regular|MRI|assessments|such|as|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|.|The|data|were|reported|in|the|study|“|Evaluation|of|Deep-Learning-Based|Technology|for|Reducing|Gadolinium|Dosage|in|Contrast-Enhanced|MRI|Exams|,|”|presented|at|the|104th|Scientific|Assembly|and|Annual|Meeting|of|the|Radiological|Society|of|North|America|(|RSNA|)|Nov|.|25-30|in|Chicago|.|Gadolinium|is|a|heavy|metal|commonly|used|as|a|contrast|agent|to|enhance|images|collected|by|MRI|scans|.|The|use|of|gadolinium|has|been|shown|to|be|safe|and|improve|MRI's|diagnostic|accuracy|as|it|aids|in|the|visualization|of|the|body's|internal|structures|.|Gadolinium-enhanced|scans|are|often|used|to|visualize|inflammation|,|tumors|,|and|blood|vessels|.|It|has|proven|to|be|a|powerful|tool|to|diagnose|several|diseases|,|including|MS|.|However|,|studies|have|recently|shown|that|for|each|dose|of|gadolinium|given|,|about|1|%|is|retained|in|the|tissues|.|The|impact|of|this|is|still|unknown|,|but|researchers|are|working|to|minimize|potential|toxicity|effects|and|optimize|patient|safety|while|preserving|the|diagnostic|accuracy|of|MRI|scans|.|“|There|is|concrete|evidence|that|gadolinium|deposits|in|the|brain|and|body|,|”|Enhao|Gong|,|PhD|,|a|researcher|at|Stanford|University|and|lead|author|of|the|study|,|said|in|a|press|release|.|“|While|the|implications|of|this|are|unclear|,|mitigating|potential|patient|risks|while|maximizing|the|clinical|value|of|the|MRI|exams|is|imperative|.|”|With|this|in|mind|,|researchers|explored|the|potential|of|artificial|intelligence|to|help|reduce|the|amount|of|gadolinium|used|in|routine|practice|.|The|team|reviewed|the|protocol|and|scan|images|of|about|200|patients|who|had|undergone|contrast-enhanced|MRI|exams|for|several|medical|indications|.|They|used|deep|learning|—|an|artificial|intelligence|technique|that|teaches|computers|by|example|—|to|assess|the|data|and|compute|an|optimized|protocol|for|gadolinium|use|.|With|this|approach|,|the|team|could|identify|very|small|differences|among|images|that|would|otherwise|remain|undetectable|to|the|eye|.|The|team|collected|three|sets|of|images|for|each|patient|:|one|to|define|baseline|values|(|before|contrast|administration|)|,|a|low-dose|scan|(|acquired|after|10|%|of|gadolinium|dose|had|been|administrated|)|,|and|a|full-dose|scan|(|acquired|after|100|%|of|gadolinium|dose|had|been|administrated|)|.|Using|the|artificial|intelligence-based|analysis|strategy|,|the|team|built|a|computer|algorithm|that|could|create|images|with|similar|quality|as|those|obtained|with|full-dose|contrast-enhanced|MRI|images|.|Researchers|also|demonstrated|that|it|would|be|possible|to|create|images|with|equivalent|diagnostic|quality|to|those|obtained|with|full-dose|contrast|agent|administration|without|really|using|any|contrast|enhancer|compound|.|“|We're|not|trying|to|replace|existing|imaging|technology|,|”|Gong|said|.|“|We're|trying|to|improve|it|and|generate|more|value|from|the|existing|information|while|looking|out|for|the|safety|of|our|patients|.|Low-dose|gadolinium|images|yield|significant|untapped|,|clinically|useful|information|that|is|accessible|now|by|using|deep|learning|and|[|artificial|intelligence|]|.|”|Additional|studies|are|still|warranted|to|further|explore|the|use|of|the|algorithm|across|a|broader|range|of|MRI|scanners|and|applied|to|different|types|of|contrast|agents|.

I am so upset I never normally say anything and he knows how bad it has been for a while to say something like that tells me he doesn't believe me or care. I already have problems convincing the doctors I don't want to have to do it at home as well! Did anyone else have this problem before they were diagnosed? Thank you for reading Edit: I would just like to say a massive thank you to everyone that has commented, I cannot tell you how much it means to me. I'm not able to speak to anyone about these things normally and it is so lovely to know that I'm not alone! Some people have asked for updates on how I get on so when I get my appointment I will let you know! Thank you for being amazing.

I've had my period for ten years and it's always been fairly regular. I use a period tracking app and I would almost always get my period on the predicted day, but ever since June (which is when I started having MS symptoms), my periods have been crazy. I'm late every month, anywhere from a few days up to over a week. Like right now for instance, I'm five days late (although I did have light bleeding and cramps for 2-3 days about two weeks ago out of nowhere which has never in my life happened to me). I'm not able to be on birth control (I also have Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension), but when/if I take a pregnancy test, they're always negative. Just wondering if this is an MS thing or if I should consult my gynecologist about it. EDIT: Thank you to everyone for the advice, I greatly appreciate it! I just called my gynecologist and I have an appointment next week. 	1	1	Irregular|Periods|and|MS|?

A new study shows an overlooked source may be able to replace that lost insulation and provide a new way to treat diseases like MS. Cells called neurons make the central nervous system work by passing electrical signals along threadlike connections called axons. Axons do their work best when wrapped in an insulating coating of a fatty substance called myelin. “When you lose myelin, axons don't conduct at their normal speed or don't conduct at all,” says Ian Duncan, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison's School of Veterinary Medicine. “And if enough of them are affected — such as in a big area of demyelination in MS — you develop clinical symptoms related to that part of the nervous system.” Myelin is made by oligodendrocytes, cells that can reach out to several nearby axons to wrap parts of them in the protective myelin sheath. Consensus has held that once an axon is robbed of its myelin, the only way to bring it back is by starting with fresh oligodendrocytes. Only oligodendrocytes arising from precursors called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells can apply a new coat of myelin to axons, goes the dogma. Thus, MS treatments aimed at remyelination have focused on recruiting progenitor cells in demyelinated areas (called plaques), and spurring them to develop. However, researchers led by Duncan have shown in a study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that starting from progenitor cells is not the only route to remyelination. In cats and rhesus macaques experiencing a severe loss of myelin, Duncan found fully developed oligodendrocytes already in place were reaching out and beginning to coat affected axons with myelin once again. The catch, if there is one, is that to be helpful and remyelinate damaged axons, the adult oligodendrocytes may still need to have connections to surviving myelin segments — called “internodes” — on other axons. “If this cell is still biologically active and maintaining these internodes, it can re-extend processes out to these demyelinated segments,” says Duncan, whose work is supported by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “Those processes can make new myelin sheaths, which end up being thinner and shorter than the previous internodes.” But even thinner myelin will restore nerve function, as Duncan and colleagues reported in 2009. Cats fed irradiated food for several months develop severe myelin loss throughout the nervous system. When the cats returned to a regular diet, nerve function was restored because of extensive myelin repair. The cats' demyelination problems are unusual as a lab model of the disease. “The de facto model to study demyelination and remyelination is in a mouse fed a toxin called cuprizone,” Duncan says. “But the toxin kills oligodendrocytes. So, studying the mouse, you naturally wouldn't see any of the original oligodendrocytes beginning remyelination.” In the new study, the researchers looked at the cats' nervous tissue and found a unique myelin mosaic — axons surrounded by thick layers of myelin (formed during development when the axons themselves grew) were interspersed with other axons surrounded by thin layers of myelin. “The most likely explanation of that mosaic appearance is surviving oligos,” Duncan says. “Thick myelin sheaths are never seen following remyelination, just thin sheaths. And surviving adult oligodendrocytes are adjacent to these sites of demyelination, making them likely candidates for myelin repair.” Sure enough, the researchers found oligodendrocytes connected to both thick and thin myelin sheaths in the cat spinal cord. The discovery of the mature myelin-producing cells' capacity for repair opens new opportunities to slow or reverse the disease. They also found this association when they reached back to a decades-old monkey model of demyelination. Neuroscientist Dimitri Agamanolis tried to make a model of another human demyelinating disease — called sub-acute combined degeneration and caused by Vitamin B12 deficiency — at Case Western Reserve University in the 1970s. Agamanolis had saved preserved blocks of sampled nervous tissue from the monkeys, and he shared them with Duncan. The monkeys' myelin lesions resembled those in the cats. “You see in the monkeys, too, single oligodendrocytes connected to mature myelin sheaths that also have processes extended out to and surrounding demyelinated axons,” Duncan says. The UW–Madison researchers enlisted Grahame Kidd and the private research lab Renovo Neural in Cleveland to reconstruct stacks of electron microscope images of cat nerve cells into 3D representations that show oligodendrocytes reaching up and down the spinal cord, sustaining mature myelin and remyelinating damaged sheaths. The process may not be playing out in human MS patients fast enough to help mitigate the progression of the disease, Duncan says. Or too many oligodendrocytes may lose so many of their internodal connections that they become inactive or die. But the discovery of the mature myelin-producing cells' capacity for repair opens new opportunities to slow or reverse the disease. “Right now, the emphasis is on promoting the numbers of oligo progenitors and their differentiation, particularly into adult oligodendrocytes,” says Duncan. “What this work provides is a different target.” That target will call for new therapeutic approaches — finding drugs, for example, that rally the oligodendrocytes to reach out with new lifelines to damaged myelin sheaths. “In fighting complex diseases, such as MS, the more tools you have on hand, the better,” Duncan says. “If these adult cells are recruitable in some fashion, we should be looking at ways to do it.” Duncan's co-authors on the study include Kidd and UW–Madison neuroscience researchers Abigail Radcliff and Moones Heidari, veterinary medicine student Lauren Wierenga, and electron microscopy specialist Benjamin August.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4679803560686356889/One-year-in-and-nothing-has-changed	One year in and nothing has changed	Hi all! I was diagnosed last year and since then my only treatment was steroid infusions during my last bad relapse. Aside from that, I haven't started any medication or treatment since the bills were so ridiculous from just being diagnosed... I know drug prices can be insane so I haven't made any appointments yet.   My symptoms have mostly subsided since then. I do experience the MS hug and near constant Lhermitte's sign/general pain and discomfort but aside from that, I haven't had many issues. I have been feeling a bit better recently after starting CBD oil as well as some vitamins on a daily basis. I'm wondering, how crucial is it to get started on medication right away? Part of the issue is that my doctors have all been awful so far, and none of them have suggested medication. But I know it's more a preventative thing than something to treat current symptoms, so is it important to get on it sooner than later?   Also, while we're on the topic.. if anyone has suggestions for clinics or doctors, that would be greatly appreciated! I tried the clinic of neurology but the neurologist there was shocked that I was still using a cane one month after our first visit, and used her iPhone light to check my eyes. She was clueless lol. I am in Minnesota. Officially diagnosed by the Mayo Clinic but if anyone happens to be aware of excellent clinics near the twin cities please let me know!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4679719970123003347/Question-about-MS-and-AIP	Question about MS and AIP	Hello, guys! Hope you all have a great week ahead :) I need an advice from those who are/have been following AIP. So in the last month I have been pre-diagnosed with Hashimoto's with a second check-up in May to either confirm diagnosis or deny it, after that a week later I was pre-diagnosed with MS. I think I'll be properly diagnosed within next month or so. The doctor said the possibility of MS is very high and to morally prepare myself for things to come. I did some reading on the subject and turns out that after you are diagnosed in my country, it may take some time before you get your medication. I can't really live in such state as of now for much longer, since I'm always tired, in pain and dizzy. Because of it I have been really slacking at work and I dread an exam week that starts in December. Since I don't have any other options for now in terms of medicating self, I decided to follow AIP in hopes of impoving my condition. So, I wanted to ask: are there any people who have followed AIP? How long it took for you to notice iprovements? How does it work with your medication? 	1	0	Question|about|MS|and|AIP	Hello|,|guys|!|Hope|you|all|have|a|great|week|ahead|:)|I|need|an|advice|from|those|who|are|/|have|been|following|AIP|.|So|in|the|last|month|I|have|been|pre-diagnosed|with|Hashimoto's|with|a|second|check-up|in|May|to|either|confirm|diagnosis|or|deny|it|,|after|that|a|week|later|I|was|pre-diagnosed|with|MS|.|I|think|I'll|be|properly|diagnosed|within|next|month|or|so|.|The|doctor|said|the|possibility|of|MS|is|very|high|and|to|morally|prepare|myself|for|things|to|come|.|I|did|some|reading|on|the|subject|and|turns|out|that|after|you|are|diagnosed|in|my|country|,|it|may|take|some|time|before|you|get|your|medication|.|I|can't|really|live|in|such|state|as|of|now|for|much|longer|,|since|I'm|always|tired|,|in|pain|and|dizzy|.|Because|of|it|I|have|been|really|slacking|at|work|and|I|dread|an|exam|week|that|starts|in|December|.|Since|I|don't|have|any|other|options|for|now|in|terms|of|medicating|self|,|I|decided|to|follow|AIP|in|hopes|of|impoving|my|condition|.|So|,|I|wanted|to|ask|:|are|there|any|people|who|have|followed|AIP|?|How|long|it|took|for|you|to|notice|iprovements|?|How|does|it|work|with|your|medication|?

I was diagnosed in 2010 and use food as my medicine (no drugs ever). I have basically lived my life with MS as an afterthought. I worked in communications and marketing for 20 years. My job was safe and comfortable. I easily got by. After being laid off a few months ago, I'm having to face the reality of ignoring my MS. I think after 8+ years of pushing myself to prove that I'm fine at work, it's caught up with me now that I've had time away from that environment. The truth is that I wasn't fine. My symptoms are cognitive—memory and communicating (speech and writing)—fatigue, and maybe vision (hard to tell if it's MS or aging). I'll have a thought to do something and will forget what I wanted to do within minutes... even before I get a chance to write it down. I can't recall details from conversations, articles, or books. In the middle of a conversation I can forget what we were talking about and/or tune out. I do a lot of smiling and nodding, or just avoiding conversations. I rarely read a book. :( This made me really slow. The need to work faster was brought up in reviews. And no, I did not officially disclose to HR that I had MS. I only told people with whom I worked closely. HR would have only known if any of them had reported it. I'm stressed out and very concerned about my ability to get and keep another job. I paid into a group long-term disability insurance policy while working and have decided to apply for it. I have a neurology appointment this week. I haven't been in over a year. My 5-year MRI scan is overdue and I expect they'll want an updated scan. Has anyone else been through anything similar? What can I expect from this process?

I'm not particularly close with this side anymore and the ones I am close with already know. How did you go about telling extended family?

If you take it do you involve your neuro in the conversation or just take it as a supplement to normal medical treatment. Curious, but not sure where to start... Edit: thanks for the responses y'all. Sounds pretty promising. I've just picked up a 5% bottle from Holland and Barrett in their Black Friday sale. Let's see how this goes... 	1	1	Advice|:|Anyone|here|use|CBD|for|RRMS|?|Hearing|good|anecotal|reports|.

(i think cameras are like $500+ so i'll work on that.) just really cool implications. i am sure there is much more it can do but honestly i don't want to keep it on my face, it smells so strong to me like chemicals and since it's right above my nose i don't know what i'm breathing in. will try to air it out. of course i thought of you bc a lot of us spend a lot of time at home, can't or prefer not to travel etc. i still prefer reality :-) but i think it will be nice to be able to escape. i am at least happy that if i have to have ms, it's at a time when there is so much stuff to do at home. it is so lifelike that i actually felt nausous on the roller coaster and when looking down at the waterfall. also i still COULD go to concerts, but i'm almost 40 and don't enjoy them anymore. a lot of time i can hardly see the band or wish i could get a drink or easily go to the bathroom. this is like...band right in your face. physically turn your head to the left, see more band members - as if you were in the room. travel on demand. i know it's not the same but it gives you options. i'm not obsessed with it but it's a diversion and if i were ever to be fully homebound i think this would even have a greater appeal. and again, there may be better/cheaper things than oculus go, just introducing the prospect of virtual reality here. 	1	1	virtual|reality|may|be|something|you|want|to|consider|for|home|entertainment|/|mental|escape|...|my|husband|just|got|an|oculus|go|(|and|there|are|other|competing|products|to|look|into|!|)|,|it's|already|very|cool|now|and|its|potential|for|the|future|is|amazing|.	i|am|posting|this|in|case|you're|like|me|and|just|wouldn't|think|of|buying|something|like|this|.|my|husband|likes|tech|stuff|and|we|just|got|an|oculus|go|-|but|there|are|other|competing|products|that|may|be|as|good|or|better|,|i|have|not|researched|at|all|(|and|btw|i|have|no|affiliation|with|any|product|.|)|my|cheap|self|agreed|to|get|it|bc|my|husband|is|home|more|than|he'd|usually|be|bc|of|me|,|so|i|agreed|to|get|it|and|i'm|glad|i|did|.|i|think|the|thing|reeks|of|chemicals|so|i|don't|keep|it|on|my|face|long|.|but|so|far|since|last|night|,|i|took|some|virtual|reality|roller|coster|rides|,|stood|on|the|top|of|a|waterfall|,|went|hanggliding|over|an|ocean|,|did|a|guided|meditation|on|a|beach|,|watched|some|video|on|an|app|so|it|feels|like|the|band|is|playing|raggae|right|in|front|of|your|face|,|took|a|tour|of|the|everglades|.|it's|like|you|can|be|anywhere|,|anytime|.|i|watched|an|asmr|video|and|it|was|like|the|woman|was|right|in|front|of|me|.|things|are|shot|with|360|degree|cameras|,|if|i|understand|correctly|.|it|is|just|in|its|infancy|stage|and|kind|of|wonky|,|but|i|can|see|the|potential|for|the|future|.|-|edit|:|i|bet|one|day|you|will|be|able|to|visit|anywhere|on|google|maps|(|or|some|other|app|)|.|i|personally|want|to|take|360|degree|video|of|me|and|my|husband|so|when|i'm|98|i|can|watch|the|video|and|it'll|be|like|i'm|in|the|room|with|my|39|year|old|self|.|(|i|think|cameras|are|like|$|500|+|so|i'll|work|on|that|.|)|just|really|cool|implications|.|i|am|sure|there|is|much|more|it|can|do|but|honestly|i|don't|want|to|keep|it|on|my|face|,|it|smells|so|strong|to|me|like|chemicals|and|since|it's|right|above|my|nose|i|don't|know|what|i'm|breathing|in|.|will|try|to|air|it|out|.|of|course|i|thought|of|you|bc|a|lot|of|us|spend|a|lot|of|time|at|home|,|can't|or|prefer|not|to|travel|etc|.|i|still|prefer|reality|:-)|but|i|think|it|will|be|nice|to|be|able|to|escape|.|i|am|at|least|happy|that|if|i|have|to|have|ms|,|it's|at|a|time|when|there|is|so|much|stuff|to|do|at|home|.|it|is|so|lifelike|that|i|actually|felt|nausous|on|the|roller|coaster|and|when|looking|down|at|the|waterfall|.|also|i|still|COULD|go|to|concerts|,|but|i'm|almost|40|and|don't|enjoy|them|anymore|.|a|lot|of|time|i|can|hardly|see|the|band|or|wish|i|could|get|a|drink|or|easily|go|to|the|bathroom|.|this|is|like|...|band|right|in|your|face|.|physically|turn|your|head|to|the|left|,|see|more|band|members|-|as|if|you|were|in|the|room|.|travel|on|demand|.|i|know|it's|not|the|same|but|it|gives|you|options|.|i'm|not|obsessed|with|it|but|it's|a|diversion|and|if|i|were|ever|to|be|fully|homebound|i|think|this|would|even|have|a|greater|appeal|.|and|again|,|there|may|be|better|/|cheaper|things|than|oculus|go|,|just|introducing|the|prospect|of|virtual|reality|here|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4678894216961453916/Hello-i-guess!	Hello i guess!	Hey dear redditors! TL;DR: possibly having MS (getting my results next week) and just wanted to introduce myself and say hello to all of you! First a bit of a background info: I'm 25 yo, m, currently living in different city then my parents, studying biology. So a few weeks ago, I start to have a numb feeling I my left thumb. Not giving it too much thought I just continue my everyday life normally. A couple of days later I decide to go on a trip to visit my parents. Now not only my thumb is numb but the feeling starts to spread into my palm and the tip of my other fingers, left hand, as well. After a few days again I start to notice that my left leg also starts to have the same numb feeling. It is best described by comparing it to a part of the body falling asleep after some wierd positions, but it doesn't quite hit the nail's head. For example I can still feel touch, heat/cold and vibrations but with my thumb I can't say whether a surface is smooth or rough. Also applying pressure makes it feel even number then usual. And even though I can still walk normally I feel a generell numbness and can't tell for example wether my leg is still wet after showering (good thing I have a comparison with my right leg, I didn't even notice so far in my life that I can actually feel wetness on my leg without any air current or cloth touching it). At this point I start to wonder about the condition 1st for being around for more than a week and 2nd showing a worsening character. So after talking to a specific neurology clinic in my home town they tell me to come to the emergency room(if that's what you call it where you can go without appointment in an emergency. Sry btw not a native speaker). After a short talk with the doctor there, he tells me without MRT and checking the CSF he can't do anything and I get sent home because there is no appointment available for at least 5 days. I then get in contact with a doctor, a friend of my parents, who also did a check on me recently, related to some depressive episode I had. I come there and he is very worried about my condition and gets me an appointment for cerebral MRT a few hours later the day. MRT results show 4 spots possible being some kind of infection herd(correct English term for the white spots?) And some irregularities in my spinal cord. So a few days later I get another MRT appointment for my cord and 5 other herds get spotted with one being kind of fresh, reacting to the contrast medium, and being located at a spot where it would explain the numbness in my left body half. Today I then got an appointment at a neurologist and got some CSF extracted. At first I was kind of scared but the procedure was not painful, pretty fast and easy overall. During the 1h phase where I need to lay down I got my first Prednisolone(Cortisone) Infusion and 4 a to come in the next days. Even though it is not 100% sure that I have MS, because I have to wait for the results, all the doctors tell me that it is very like to be MS. So I kinda used the rest of day, where I also had to stay calm and not being able to do much physical stuff done, to get a good read about MS. And it kind of fascinated me how largely different all the symptoms and the history of this illness can be. And ofc I got to Reddit to see this community here and instantly subed and have been reading a lot of posts. So even if I turn out not to have MS you got yourself a new community member who is willing to share his knowledge, story, wisdom and love to everyone in need; family members, MS patients or just curious readers. And I just had to say hello and start sharing. The post got a lot longer than I initially assumed and I'm typing on my phone, in the middle of the night, in a secondary language so you are welcome to kindly overlook any spelling or grammatical errors unless some parts don't make sense! :D. 	1	0	Hello|i|guess|!

I also have an old lesion on my pons as well which I also found incredibly interesting. I wish I would have remembered to ask for the MRI disc so I could look myself.

The company announced that has submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting to start the trial. A separate Phase 3 study of NurOwn in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients is underway and enrolling. “We plan to quickly initiate the Phase 2 clinical study of NurOwn in progressive MS to address the significant unmet need for MS patients,” Ralph Kern, MD, chief operating officer and chief medical officer of BrainStorm, said in a press release. NurOwn is an autologous (self) stem cell therapy that takes the patient's own mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), modifies them and then returns them to the patient to promote nerve cell-supporting mechanisms. These stem cells are engineered to produce signaling molecules that regulate the activity of surrounding cells, as well as to secrete neurotrophic factors (NTF) that support the growth, survival, and differentiation of nerve cells. These features support expectations that MSCs could be potential regulators of neurodegeneration, while protecting neurons from damage. Submitting an IND is an “important step toward the development of NurOwn in progressive MS,” said Chaim Lebovits, president and CEO of BrainStorm, and “confirms our commitment to bring to the market innovative cellular therapies for neurodegenerative disease.” The company, Kern added, has already “demonstrated [the] safety and efficacy experience of NurOwn in our amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinical program.” Results from a Phase 2 trial (NCT02017912) showed that NurOwn could significantly slow functional decline compared to placebo in patients with early stage ALS. Treatment also showed immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects via regulation of small RNA molecules in the cerebral spinal fluid. BrainStorm is currently evaluating NurOwn's safety and efficacy in about 200 adults with ALS in a Phase 3 trial (NCT03280056), now enrolling eligible patients at sites in the U.S. and Canada. 	1	0	NEWS|:|Phase|2|Trial|of|NurOwn|Stem|Cell|Therapy|in|Progressive|MS|(|PPMS|)|Planned|for|US|,|BrainStorm|Announces|(|in|case|any|of|you|want|to|join|.|also|mentions|ALS|)	when|i|learn|of|studies|,|i'll|share|them|for|you|warriors|who|want|to|join|.|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/11/21/brainstorm-plans-phase-2-trial-of-nurown-stem-cell-therapy-in-progressive-ms-patients-in-us/|NOVEMBER|21|,|2018|Alice|Melão|BrainStorm|Cell|Therapeutics|is|planning|to|launch|a|Phase|2|clinical|trial|in|the|United|States|to|evaluate|the|safety|and|activity|of|its|lead|cell|therapy|candidate|,|NurOwn|,|in|people|with|progressive|multiple|sclerosis|(|MS|)|.|The|company|announced|that|has|submitted|an|Investigational|New|Drug|(|IND|)|application|to|the|U|.|S|.|Food|and|Drug|Administration|(|FDA|)|requesting|to|start|the|trial|.|A|separate|Phase|3|study|of|NurOwn|in|treating|amyotrophic|lateral|sclerosis|(|ALS|)|patients|is|underway|and|enrolling|.|“|We|plan|to|quickly|initiate|the|Phase|2|clinical|study|of|NurOwn|in|progressive|MS|to|address|the|significant|unmet|need|for|MS|patients|,|”|Ralph|Kern|,|MD|,|chief|operating|officer|and|chief|medical|officer|of|BrainStorm|,|said|in|a|press|release|.|NurOwn|is|an|autologous|(|self|)|stem|cell|therapy|that|takes|the|patient's|own|mesenchymal|stem|cells|(|MSCs|)|,|modifies|them|and|then|returns|them|to|the|patient|to|promote|nerve|cell-supporting|mechanisms|.|These|stem|cells|are|engineered|to|produce|signaling|molecules|that|regulate|the|activity|of|surrounding|cells|,|as|well|as|to|secrete|neurotrophic|factors|(|NTF|)|that|support|the|growth|,|survival|,|and|differentiation|of|nerve|cells|.|These|features|support|expectations|that|MSCs|could|be|potential|regulators|of|neurodegeneration|,|while|protecting|neurons|from|damage|.|Submitting|an|IND|is|an|“|important|step|toward|the|development|of|NurOwn|in|progressive|MS|,|”|said|Chaim|Lebovits|,|president|and|CEO|of|BrainStorm|,|and|“|confirms|our|commitment|to|bring|to|the|market|innovative|cellular|therapies|for|neurodegenerative|disease|.|”|The|company|,|Kern|added|,|has|already|“|demonstrated|[|the|]|safety|and|efficacy|experience|of|NurOwn|in|our|amyotrophic|lateral|sclerosis|(|ALS|)|clinical|program|.|”|Results|from|a|Phase|2|trial|(|NCT|02017912|)|showed|that|NurOwn|could|significantly|slow|functional|decline|compared|to|placebo|in|patients|with|early|stage|ALS|.|Treatment|also|showed|immunomodulatory|and|neuroprotective|effects|via|regulation|of|small|RNA|molecules|in|the|cerebral|spinal|fluid|.|BrainStorm|is|currently|evaluating|NurOwn's|safety|and|efficacy|in|about|200|adults|with|ALS|in|a|Phase|3|trial|(|NCT|03280056|)|,|now|enrolling|eligible|patients|at|sites|in|the|U|.|S|.|and|Canada|.

"i know not to blindly take the internet's advice but i like to get as much input as i can. i got my first dose of ocrevus. it was my first ms drug. i've been under an incredible amount of stress and was having a reactivation of old symptoms when i went in for my first dose of ocrevus, which went well. but the next day i was having difficulty walking, a lot of stiffness, a lot of heaviness, and a few days later, a numb waist. all of these are new symptoms and they have not gone away, though the numbness in waist is abating. i talked to my doctor and he says he doesn't think it's related to the drug, he thinks it's just bad luck and bad timing, he says sometimes this happens when people start a new drug (he still attributed it to bad/luck timing for them too), that maybe i got a new lesion, he ordered me to get 2 mris this weekend and told me not to cancel the next dosage. it's possible he's right, but a new lesion the day after an infusion? i think i only have 6 lesions to begin with in 7 years, have to check that. sure it could be coincidence, but after reading some people's stories here i am wondering. i also had read about the gilenya warning - those come out because enough people report adverse reactions to the fda or to the drug company itself, which is required to disclose to the fda. i read so many stories here that i would imagine go unreported, so no one official - doctors, fda, learns about them, so they say, ""i've never heard of that happening"" - even if in reality it happens often. (you can report adverse reactions here fda. gov/medwatch or call 1 (888) 463-6332, just to let them know what's going on.) if more people reported, everyone would be way more informed. maybe i'll make another post about the importance of reporting. afaik it doesn't get the drug immediately shut down, the fda just follows up on cases - and then if they see a trend, they issue warnings, as they did with gilenya. - feel free to correct me if i'm wrong about any of this. i am going to get the 2 mris this weekend. my doctor will call me with mri results and i will share my concerns with him. i am thinking of not getting my 2nd dose because i don't want to get any worse. but i'd like to hear if anyone else has had this experience of getting new symptoms after any drug. any input appreciated.

I have RRMS and it's been over a year and I haven't truely felt like I've been in remission once. I see other people with RRMS in wheelchairs and things too. I thought that I'm supposed to get better after relapsing, why hasn't it happened? I've had at least two relapses this past year and a half, the one from over a year ago has just gotten worse and the one in February has stayed pretty consistent. I'm currently on Ocrevus, almost six months now, and hopefully I continue to stay relatively stable but my doctors keep telling me I should IMPROVE soon and it hasn't happened yet. Can someone explain if this is normal with RRMS? I'm paranoid I might be transitioning into SPMS and that scare me a lot. 	1	1	Why|am|I|not|feeling|better|?

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4677757759018568205/fda-just-put-out-a-gilenya-Fingolimod-warning	fda just put out a gilenya (Fingolimod) warning	edit: article below says it's rare. far below there are actual numbers of incidents reported and more details.   FDA direct link: [https://www. fda. gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm626264.htm](https://www. It was previously approved to treat adults with the relapsing form of the disease in 2010. According to the FDA, current estimates report that 8000-10,000 children and adolescents in the US suffer from MS, though most patients experience their first symptoms of the neurological condition between the ages of 20-40. The FDA's warning issued on Tuesday stated that stopping treatment with fingolimod could result in a patient's condition becoming “much worse than before the medicine was start or while it was being taken.” “This MS worsening is rare but can result in permanent disability,” the administration stated. They further advised that healthcare providers inform patients prior to their starting treatment about the potential risk once stopping fingolimod, and to carefully observe patients for evidence of MS exacerbation in instances when therapy is stopped. In cases of patients experiencing new or worsened symptoms of MS after fingolimod is stopped, they should seek immediate medical attention, and be tested for new or enhancing lesions in the event of increased disability. Worsened symptoms patients should look out for include weakness, trouble using arms or legs, as well as changes in thinking, eyesight, or balance. The FDA also advised that patients read the Medication Guide provided with Gilenya prescriptions, detailing the benefits and risks of the therapy.   EDIT: u/synapsecracklepop found this - verrry helpful thank you >FDA identified 35 cases of severe increase in disability accompanied by the presence of multiple new gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following the discontinuation of Gilenya reported in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database and the medical literature from September 2010 through February 2018. Twenty-nine cases described symptoms of severe increase in disability beginning less than 12 weeks after Gilenya was discontinued, and six cases described symptoms beginning between 12 and 24 weeks after Gilenya was discontinued. Diagnosis was based on MRI findings of multiple new gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the brain beyond baseline, and severe neurological symptoms based on clinical judgment or Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score worsening of any magnitude. > >The time on Gilenya prior to discontinuation ranged from 7 months to 96 months in these patients. The most common reason for discontinuing Gilenya was that patients intended to become pregnant or had become pregnant. Other reasons for discontinuation included lack of efficacy, lymphopenia, infections, or cancer. > >Patient outcomes after the severe increase in disability following Gilenya discontinuation varied. Of the 31 patients with adequately documented outcomes, 6 had a full recovery (reported as either a return to EDSS score reported while on Gilenya or “complete recovery”), 17 had a partial recovery, and 8 had permanent disability or no recovery. > >EDSS scores were available for 18 patients while on Gilenya or immediately after discontinuation, and at the time of peak increase in disability after Gilenya discontinuation. The change from EDSS on Gilenya to peak worsening in EDSS after discontinuation ranged from 1.0 to 8.5 (mean change was 2.5). Five of the 18 patients had a worsening of EDSS to ≥ 8.0 at the time of peak worsening after discontinuation which means a patient is essentially restricted to a bed or wheelchair for most of the day. > >Treatments for increased disability varied; however, all 35 patients received corticosteroids as the initial treatment. Of the six patients who were reported to have experienced a full recovery, three received only intravenous methylprednisolone, and the other three received plasma exchange, intrathecal triamcinolone, or re-started Gilenya. Other patients were also treated with plasma exchange, natalizumab, Gilenya, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer, and methotrexate. We have not determined the best approach to discontinuing treatment or the best way to treat a severe increase in disability if it occurs. 	1	0	fda|just|put|out|a|gilenya|(|Fingolimod|)|warning	edit|:|article|below|says|it's|rare|.|far|below|there|are|actual|numbers|of|incidents|reported|and|more|details|.|FDA|direct|link|:|[|https://www|.|fda|.|gov|/|Safety|/|MedWatch|/|SafetyInformation|/|SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts|/|ucm626264.htm|]|(|https://www|.|It|was|previously|approved|to|treat|adults|with|the|relapsing|form|of|the|disease|in|2010|.|According|to|the|FDA|,|current|estimates|report|that|8000-10|,|000|children|and|adolescents|in|the|US|suffer|from|MS|,|though|most|patients|experience|their|first|symptoms|of|the|neurological|condition|between|the|ages|of|20-40|.|The|FDA's|warning|issued|on|Tuesday|stated|that|stopping|treatment|with|fingolimod|could|result|in|a|patient's|condition|becoming|“|much|worse|than|before|the|medicine|was|start|or|while|it|was|being|taken|.|”|“|This|MS|worsening|is|rare|but|can|result|in|permanent|disability|,|”|the|administration|stated|.|They|further|advised|that|healthcare|providers|inform|patients|prior|to|their|starting|treatment|about|the|potential|risk|once|stopping|fingolimod|,|and|to|carefully|observe|patients|for|evidence|of|MS|exacerbation|in|instances|when|therapy|is|stopped|.|In|cases|of|patients|experiencing|new|or|worsened|symptoms|of|MS|after|fingolimod|is|stopped|,|they|should|seek|immediate|medical|attention|,|and|be|tested|for|new|or|enhancing|lesions|in|the|event|of|increased|disability|.|Worsened|symptoms|patients|should|look|out|for|include|weakness|,|trouble|using|arms|or|legs|,|as|well|as|changes|in|thinking|,|eyesight|,|or|balance|.|The|FDA|also|advised|that|patients|read|the|Medication|Guide|provided|with|Gilenya|prescriptions|,|detailing|the|benefits|and|risks|of|the|therapy|.|EDIT|:|u|/|synapsecracklepop|found|this|-|verrry|helpful|thank|you|>|FDA|identified|35|cases|of|severe|increase|in|disability|accompanied|by|the|presence|of|multiple|new|gadolinium-enhancing|lesions|on|magnetic|resonance|imaging|(|MRI|)|following|the|discontinuation|of|Gilenya|reported|in|the|FDA|Adverse|Event|Reporting|System|(|FAERS|)|database|and|the|medical|literature|from|September|2010|through|February|2018|.|Twenty-nine|cases|described|symptoms|of|severe|increase|in|disability|beginning|less|than|12|weeks|after|Gilenya|was|discontinued|,|and|six|cases|described|symptoms|beginning|between|12|and|24|weeks|after|Gilenya|was|discontinued|.|Diagnosis|was|based|on|MRI|findings|of|multiple|new|gadolinium-enhancing|lesions|in|the|brain|beyond|baseline|,|and|severe|neurological|symptoms|based|on|clinical|judgment|or|Expanded|Disability|Status|Scale|(|EDSS|)|score|worsening|of|any|magnitude|.|>|>|The|time|on|Gilenya|prior|to|discontinuation|ranged|from|7|months|to|96|months|in|these|patients|.|The|most|common|reason|for|discontinuing|Gilenya|was|that|patients|intended|to|become|pregnant|or|had|become|pregnant|.|Other|reasons|for|discontinuation|included|lack|of|efficacy|,|lymphopenia|,|infections|,|or|cancer|.|>|>|Patient|outcomes|after|the|severe|increase|in|disability|following|Gilenya|discontinuation|varied|.|Of|the|31|patients|with|adequately|documented|outcomes|,|6|had|a|full|recovery|(|reported|as|either|a|return|to|EDSS|score|reported|while|on|Gilenya|or|“|complete|recovery|”|)|,|17|had|a|partial|recovery|,|and|8|had|permanent|disability|or|no|recovery|.|>|>|EDSS|scores|were|available|for|18|patients|while|on|Gilenya|or|immediately|after|discontinuation|,|and|at|the|time|of|peak|increase|in|disability|after|Gilenya|discontinuation|.|The|change|from|EDSS|on|Gilenya|to|peak|worsening|in|EDSS|after|discontinuation|ranged|from|1.0|to|8.5|(|mean|change|was|2.5|)|.|Five|of|the|18|patients|had|a|worsening|of|EDSS|to|≥|8.0|at|the|time|of|peak|worsening|after|discontinuation|which|means|a|patient|is|essentially|restricted|to|a|bed|or|wheelchair|for|most|of|the|day|.|>|>|Treatments|for|increased|disability|varied|;|however|,|all|35|patients|received|corticosteroids|as|the|initial|treatment|.|Of|the|six|patients|who|were|reported|to|have|experienced|a|full|recovery|,|three|received|only|intravenous|methylprednisolone|,|and|the|other|three|received|plasma|exchange|,|intrathecal|triamcinolone|,|or|re-started|Gilenya|.|Other|patients|were|also|treated|with|plasma|exchange|,|natalizumab|,|Gilenya|,|cyclophosphamide|,|rituximab|,|dimethyl|fumarate|,|glatiramer|,|and|methotrexate|.|We|have|not|determined|the|best|approach|to|discontinuing|treatment|or|the|best|way|to|treat|a|severe|increase|in|disability|if|it|occurs|.

This relapse has been bad enough that it's kept me out of work since August, and it's been suggested that I go on permanent disability. Now we're keeping track of how quickly things are progressing and my symptoms have been pretty chronic and scary. So I thought it would be a good idea to spend some time with loved ones, as I may not have many opportunities to do so in the future. And I made a birthday event page on FB to have a get together after the MRIs.. 12 rsvped and 15 maybes. I spent my birthday alone. Then went to get my scans done. Then went to my birthday event, only to find that no one is showing up. I understand it's a busy time of year for people, but if I had known that they were canceling, I would have gotten dinner instead. This has been a super hard past couple years for me, you guys. And MS is just a small fraction of it. So my heart is heavy... I never give with the expectation of receiving something in return. But I wish I wasn't alone right now.

The FDA's decision to approve the company's [application](https://www. fda. gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/howdrugsaredevelopedandapproved/approvalapplications/abbreviatednewdrugapplicationandagenerics/default.htm) for teriflunomide tablets at two doses also makes Glenmark eligible for 180 days of shared generic drug exclusivity, a [press release](http://www.glenmarkpharma.com/sites/default/files/Glenmark-receives-ANDA-approval-for-Teriflunomide-Tablets-7-mg-and-14-mg. pdf) reports. Shared exclusivity can be granted for 180 days (about six months) to “multiple generic firms that are first to challenge different patents on the same drug,” the [FDA notes](https://www.fdanews.com/articles/66865-law-allows-generic-shared-exclusivity-fda-says?v=preview). Glenmark's application was reported in the release to be the most complete submitted for teriflunomide tablets, providing clinical evidence of strength, dosage, quality, safety, and efficacy similar to its brand-name counterpart. This information supports a granting of exclusivity. . While [generics](https://www. gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/GenericDrugs/default.htm) have the same active ingredients and are required to work in the same way as brand-name medicines, they are less expensive because they carry lower development costs. Glenmark has not yet released information regarding pricing for its generic teriflunomide tablets, or a likely date of availability in U.S. pharmacies. Teriflunomide can inhibit the activity of an enzyme necessary for immune cells to proliferate and mature. With its particular mode of action, teriflunomide can prevent inflammatory reactions that are involved in damage to nerve cells that typify MS, particularly the loss of their protective myelin sheath. [Aubagio](http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/aubagio-teriflunomide-multiple-sclerosis/) tablets were first approved in the Unites Stated in 2012 to treat relapsing forms of MS, and also approved for these patients in the European Union. Results from two Phase 3 trials ([NCT00751881](https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT00751881) and [NCT00134563](https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT00134563)) and two Phase 2 trials ([NCT00489489](https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT00489489) and [NCT00475865](https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT00475865)) provided clinical evidence that 7 mg and 14 mg of Aubagio could [effectively](https://www.accessdata. gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2012/202992Orig1s000SumR. pdf) reduce the incidence of MS relapse events and prevent the risk of disease progression. Long-term extension studies also [demonstrated](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2017/10/23/ms-paris-2017-sanofi-genzyme-presents-data-on-long-term-lemtrada-and-aubagio-use/) that treatment with Aubagio can slow brain tissue loss and improve cognitive outcomes. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, based in India, specializes in branded generic medicines. Its release states that the company currently has 142 products approved for distribution in the U.S.      . 	1	0	FDA|Approves|Generic|Version|of|Aubagio|to|Treat|Relapsing|MS|,|Glenmark|Pharma|Says	sorry|i've|been|out|of|touch|.|i|need|to|respond|to|at|least|one|of|you|-|it's|been|one|hell|of|a|two|months|.|anyway|,|news|to|share|in|case|anyone|takes|aubagio|:|Source|:|[|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/11/20/fda-approves-generic-of-aubagio-tablets-to-treat-relapsing-ms-glenmark-pharma-announces/|]|(|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/11/20/fda-approves-generic-of-aubagio-tablets-to-treat-relapsing-ms-glenmark-pharma-announces/|)|FDA|Approves|Generic|Version|of|Aubagio|to|Treat|Relapsing|MS|,|Glenmark|Pharma|Says|pasted|:|The|U|.|S|.|Food|and|Drug|Administration|(|FDA|)|has|approved|a|generic|version|of|[|Aubagio|]|(|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/aubagio-teriflunomide-multiple-sclerosis/|)|(|teriflunomide|)|tablets|at|the|7|mg|and|14|mg|doses|marketed|by|[|Sanofi|]|(|http://sanofi-aventis.us/|)|,|according|to|the|generic's|manufacturer|,|[|Glenmark|Pharmaceuticals|]|(|http://www.glenmarkpharma.com/|)|.|The|FDA's|decision|to|approve|the|company's|[|application|]|(|https://www|.|fda|.|gov|/|drugs|/|developmentapprovalprocess|/|howdrugsaredevelopedandapproved|/|approvalapplications|/|abbreviatednewdrugapplicationandagenerics|/|default.htm|)|for|teriflunomide|tablets|at|two|doses|also|makes|Glenmark|eligible|for|180|days|of|shared|generic|drug|exclusivity|,|a|[|press|release|]|(|http://www.glenmarkpharma.com/sites/default/files/Glenmark-receives-ANDA-approval-for-Teriflunomide-Tablets-7-mg-and-14-mg|.|pdf|)|reports|.|Shared|exclusivity|can|be|granted|for|180|days|(|about|six|months|)|to|“|multiple|generic|firms|that|are|first|to|challenge|different|patents|on|the|same|drug|,|”|the|[|FDA|notes|]|(|https://www.fdanews.com/articles/66865-law-allows-generic-shared-exclusivity-fda-says?v=preview|)|.|Glenmark's|application|was|reported|in|the|release|to|be|the|most|complete|submitted|for|teriflunomide|tablets|,|providing|clinical|evidence|of|strength|,|dosage|,|quality|,|safety|,|and|efficacy|similar|to|its|brand-name|counterpart|.|This|information|supports|a|granting|of|exclusivity|. .|While|[|generics|]|(|https://www|.|gov|/|Drugs|/|ResourcesForYou|/|Consumers|/|BuyingUsingMedicineSafely|/|GenericDrugs|/|default.htm|)|have|the|same|active|ingredients|and|are|required|to|work|in|the|same|way|as|brand-name|medicines|,|they|are|less|expensive|because|they|carry|lower|development|costs|.|Glenmark|has|not|yet|released|information|regarding|pricing|for|its|generic|teriflunomide|tablets|,|or|a|likely|date|of|availability|in|U|.|S|.|pharmacies|.|Teriflunomide|can|inhibit|the|activity|of|an|enzyme|necessary|for|immune|cells|to|proliferate|and|mature|.|With|its|particular|mode|of|action|,|teriflunomide|can|prevent|inflammatory|reactions|that|are|involved|in|damage|to|nerve|cells|that|typify|MS|,|particularly|the|loss|of|their|protective|myelin|sheath|.|[|Aubagio|]|(|http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/aubagio-teriflunomide-multiple-sclerosis/|)|tablets|were|first|approved|in|the|Unites|Stated|in|2012|to|treat|relapsing|forms|of|MS|,|and|also|approved|for|these|patients|in|the|European|Union|.|Results|from|two|Phase|3|trials|(|[|NCT|00751881|]|(|https://clinicaltrials|.|gov|/|ct2|/|show|/|NCT|00751881|)|and|[|NCT|00134563|]|(|https://clinicaltrials|.|gov|/|ct2|/|show|/|NCT|00134563|)|)|and|two|Phase|2|trials|(|[|NCT|00489489|]|(|https://clinicaltrials|.|gov|/|ct2|/|show|/|NCT|00489489|)|and|[|NCT|00475865|]|(|https://clinicaltrials|.|gov|/|ct2|/|show|/|NCT|00475865|)|)|provided|clinical|evidence|that|7|mg|and|14|mg|of|Aubagio|could|[|effectively|]|(|https://www.accessdata|.|gov|/|drugsatfda_docs|/|nda|/|2012/202992|Orig|1s000SumR|.|pdf|)|reduce|the|incidence|of|MS|relapse|events|and|prevent|the|risk|of|disease|progression|.|Long-term|extension|studies|also|[|demonstrated|]|(|https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2017/10/23/ms-paris-2017-sanofi-genzyme-presents-data-on-long-term-lemtrada-and-aubagio-use/|)|that|treatment|with|Aubagio|can|slow|brain|tissue|loss|and|improve|cognitive|outcomes|.|Glenmark|Pharmaceuticals|,|based|in|India|,|specializes|in|branded|generic|medicines|.|Its|release|states|that|the|company|currently|has|142|products|approved|for|distribution|in|the|U|.|S|.   .

I was diagnosed 2 years ago September and for the majority of the time I've been dealing with this monster primarily by myself. I was on rebif for the first year but it wasn't helping so they took me off of that. Its now been a year that i have had no meds what so ever and barely any Dr supervision. Hell, I only met ""my MS DR"" last week. Even though he's supposedly been my Dr since diagnoses. It suck and i have no faith in my doctors, but don't have much choice cause its the VA. Back to my question, they are pushing me towards tysabri badly. I was ok with it, signed up for MSTouch, the whole nine yards. Even though they did the test 3 months ago, my Dr didn't tell me till my last visit (Thursday of last week) that i tested positive for the JC virus. If i'd known that, i wouldn't have agreed to it and when i told him that i was hesitant now he pretty much brushed it aside. question is, is it worth the risk?

I need help. I lost my health insurance and haven't been on my medication since then. I was told by my Dr to go to a clinic and take Phentermine to help with my fatigue, and in addition it would help me lose weight that I was trying to do as well to get my BMI down where dr would be happy (BMI of 24 now! I'm “average!”) and it would be the most reasonable and affordable option. While it has helped with the weight loss, I feel like the fatigue is hitting back hard and I don't know what else I could do. I skipped a day to see if maybe this was attributing and let me tell you, boy was it helping more than I thought. The other thing is back pain. My lower back, is absolutely horrible. I could lay on my exercise ball all day and it wouldn't help. I wake up from pain in my back, which to be honest it's only like a 5-6/10 and then when I take some ibuprofen it's like 3-4 max, but I sleep so badly it wakes me up easily. It's also so constant I feel like there's no relief. What can I do to help in the interim before getting health insurance back? I've had steroid packs and injections and I can't have another until mid January, and they don't seem to help for very long. Can anyone give me suggestions to make me feel like existence is good right now? TL;DR BACK OUCH. BODY TIRED.

I had numb, tingling, buzzing legs and feet for more than a month, thankfully that has improved. Now it's just my left leg that feels burny and strange 95% of the time... I think I've had every test there is to have and this past Wednesday I had a spinal tap. I was feeling pretty normal and good (even went to the gym... more than once!). The day of the tap, I did go to work, had it done, it was awful, the doc hit nerves like 4x and I got REALLY nauseous, hot and sweaty in the middle of it... I laid flat for two hours, went home and did nothing. The next day is where I messed up... I went to work. I was just a little tired and my back hurt but I was okay. Then around 2pm my head felt like it was going to explode. I went home and climbed directly into bed. I stayed home Friday and stayed in bed all day.. Saturday I tried to be a human and took a shower and got ready and went out for lunch, it was awful...too loud, too bright... I was exhausted and in pain. Today I haven't been able to do much, I showered, had to rest, decided I was going to the store damnnit and helped the BF make dinner, felt like vomiting... had to lie down. I feel angry because I was finally feeling better and now I'm having blurry vision in my right eye again, massive headaches, nausea, hot flashes and banding pain around my chest again....calling the MS specialist tomorrow, hoping to have my official DX soon so I can start a treatment plan. I guess hello everyone, I hate spinal taps. 	1	0	Spinal|tap|fun	All|I've|been|dealing|with|weird|symptoms|for|over|a|year|now|...|I|had|numb|,|tingling|,|buzzing|legs|and|feet|for|more|than|a|month|,|thankfully|that|has|improved|.|Now|it's|just|my|left|leg|that|feels|burny|and|strange|95|%|of|the|time|...|I|think|I've|had|every|test|there|is|to|have|and|this|past|Wednesday|I|had|a|spinal|tap|.|I|was|feeling|pretty|normal|and|good|(|even|went|to|the|gym|...|more|than|once|!|)|.|The|day|of|the|tap|,|I|did|go|to|work|,|had|it|done|,|it|was|awful|,|the|doc|hit|nerves|like|4x|and|I|got|REALLY|nauseous|,|hot|and|sweaty|in|the|middle|of|it|...|I|laid|flat|for|two|hours|,|went|home|and|did|nothing|.|The|next|day|is|where|I|messed|up|...|I|went|to|work|.|I|was|just|a|little|tired|and|my|back|hurt|but|I|was|okay|.|Then|around|2pm|my|head|felt|like|it|was|going|to|explode|.|I|went|home|and|climbed|directly|into|bed|.|I|stayed|home|Friday|and|stayed|in|bed|all|day|..|Saturday|I|tried|to|be|a|human|and|took|a|shower|and|got|ready|and|went|out|for|lunch|,|it|was|awful|...|too|loud|,|too|bright|...|I|was|exhausted|and|in|pain|.|Today|I|haven't|been|able|to|do|much|,|I|showered|,|had|to|rest|,|decided|I|was|going|to|the|store|damnnit|and|helped|the|BF|make|dinner|,|felt|like|vomiting|...|had|to|lie|down|.|I|feel|angry|because|I|was|finally|feeling|better|and|now|I'm|having|blurry|vision|in|my|right|eye|again|,|massive|headaches|,|nausea|,|hot|flashes|and|banding|pain|around|my|chest|again|...|calling|the|MS|specialist|tomorrow|,|hoping|to|have|my|official|DX|soon|so|I|can|start|a|treatment|plan|.|I|guess|hello|everyone|,|I|hate|spinal|taps|.

I have been checking this forum from time to time, but never made a post.   My girlfriend was diagnosed with MS about 2 years ago(we have been a pair for about 6 months now) but she doesn't seam to take it seriously. I know more about her disease than she do, and it frightens me to know how her life may become. She wants to have children, and I have never thought about that before, now I kinda do. But I don't want to do all the work if she gets worse. I already do most of the household chores, because she's tired and I get that, I really do. But i'm battling addiction right now so everything feels very hard. I've tried talking to her, but she has this ""I have no problem"" approach to everything, and I don't know what to do anymore. I don't wanna leave her alone in this situation, but at the same time I can't live like this. Many times I take drugs or drink to be able to manage everything, and it doesn't feel right! Should I give her more time? I mean it's been 2 years now. I'm Bipolar and I have ADHD, which i can't get any medication against because i'm using. It's starting to feel like a vicious circle.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4677101302983482999/Ended-up-in-the-hospital-last-night...	Ended up in the hospital last night...	Hi everyone, right now I'm just depressed and scared. I posted last week asking for help because I had the worst MS Hug I have ever had. Everyone was so supportive it really made me feel less alone. Well turns out that wasn't the worst, yesterday is the new worst. Small background, I was diagnosed at 18 with just sensory symptoms that went away. I've been pretty much symptom free and now I'm 27. Once in a while if I was hot, tired, or stressed I would get the MS hug. It would be severe but last 5-10 mins. Last week I got it and it was less severe but lasted 4 hours. Finally I got a hold of my doctor who recommended Benadryl was a natural muscle relaxer. Surprisingly this worked. So now it brings us to yesterday. I was having a great and normal day, ate a late lunch at 330 and after I felt a cramp in my side. I kept ignoring it and around 4 I'd say it was a full blown MS Hug. The absolute worst I've ever had. I was in so much pain I was throwing up. This was terrifying. I tried the Benadryl again but nothing was helping. Eventually I went to the ER. everyone was nice for the most part but they were not neurologists so they really didn't know much about the hug. One doctor even said “so I know with ms you are constantly in pain, but when did the pain get worst?” I'm like “actually some people might be, some might not be I actually never feel pain unless it's the Ms hug and it's usually for five mins every one in a while” I just felt annoyed and stereotyped almost? I actually had to explain from my googling any info I had on it and what they could possibly give me. Well they wanted to run other tests to make sure it's nothing else, so i got a full blood test, pregnancy test, X-ray of my chest, and ekg. All were clear. I was a bit relieved because it feels so life threatening that part of me was like wait is there something else wrong??? I had never had it for so long and then two weeks in a row I'm this sick from it? Meanwhile I'm still throwing up and dry heaving from the pain. I was there about 4 hours before they finally gave me Valium, a muscle relaxer, a pain med, and a steroid oh and something for the throwing up. I finally left and was able to sleep when I got home. I woke up with no Hug thankfully! But instead I am SO SORE! I wonder if this is because of all the spasms my muscles were doing? I can barely walk and it hurts to breath but it's a different type of pain it's not a spasm like usual and if I don't move I don't feel it, it's more of a strained muscles all through my back and chest.

It's hard to relate to the MS Community where I live because it's considerably older than I am and considerably more disabled than I am. I want to find connections with other people who suffer from MS but it's been so hard to connect because it feels like so much of meeting other people with the disease is comparing symptoms. I don't know how to accept my disease, no matter what my what symptoms are, and I don't know how that affects my ability to find real connections and support for my disease. I want to be ok with this and be able to take care of myself and then be able to help other people with the disease but I'm still looking for that acceptance within myself.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4676659864928765271/Questions-about-Avonex	Questions about Avonex	I've been following this subreddit for a month now while my diagnosis was still up in the air and it's been really helpful so thank you all! I just got officially diagnosed about 10 minutes ago with RRMS. I had some of what seem to be the common symptoms to include an insane sharp shooting pain on the right side of my face once every 10 minutes lasting 5-10 seconds with slurred speech if it happened while I was talking. The area became numb as well, that's when I went to the doctor, then brain mri w/o contrast which had “multiple supratentorial white lesions” which leads me to right now. The symptoms started in July and abruptly ended mid October. So there's some back story. I have a few questions. Is anyone on here going to the VA to treat their MS? I'm a veteran and chose to just keep my VA healthcare instead of getting on my husbands ins because it's cheaper and I'm not prone to sickness, until now lol so I'm just curious if anyone has VA healthcare because I've not had a chance to talk about prices and copays so I'm freaking out. Second is about Avonex. Ive actually been kept at the VA since Wednesday to have all new MRIs with and w/o contrast, spinal tap, blood work, etc and now I'm waiting to go down to the pharmacy and get my first shot and be shown how to do it at home. Just curious about anyone's personal experience?

He told me to decide which medication I want to go on. I am 100% absolutely clueless about MS medication (for reasons you will see why). Although I go to a world class MS clinic the turnover is atrocious so I have had tons of differing advice from numerous Neuros: Me: 50 years old male Diagnosed at 19 No long term medications (ie. copaxone). Only given medication to deal with flare ups (sometimes) I have had 2 full blown flare ups in 30 years or so and a few symptoms. As I am aging I notice symptoms and my MS ramping up. I don't want to risk it so I want to go on medication. MRI stable and so far, has not shown any new lesions for at least 15+ years BUT I am starting to feel MS creeping in and multiple neuros said lesions don't show until formed so I may be developing them but not yet visible on MRI. I believe them,. Can anyone educate me towards what I should be looking for in term of meds? Maybe someone with experiences like mine. I am leaning towards the more ""tried and true"" ones like copaxone but worried that the literature says it only deals with reduced relapses and not progression (do any meds actually stop progression????).

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4676097140506096665/Small-Victory...	Small Victory...	Diagnosed at the beginning of August. Right before initiating treatment was the worst bout of fatigue I have ever experienced. I was sleeping 10-12 hours a night and attempting to exercise, but I was struggling to wipe myself off the floor. My fatigue got to the point where I couldn't work out. I had to lower from HIIT to stationary biking to swimming as my fatigue increased, but even my last few swims before initiating treatment ended up just getting into the pool and almost instantly getting out due to fatigue. I have been on treatment for 6 weeks now. Slowly my fatigue has declined. Today I went running. I ran a whole mile and did not stop. My body did not hurt. My fatigue was minimal. My endurance was normal. I almost cried at the end of my mile that I had enough energy to go lift after. Maybe this diagnosis isn't the end.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4676097140506987738/Husband-diagnosed-with-optic-neuritis-and-likely-MS	Husband diagnosed with optic neuritis and likely MS	So six days ago my husband had acute onset of decreased vision in left eye. He got in to his optometrist three days ago, had an orbital MRI that afternoon. We saw a specialist this morning. He ordered spinal tap and full head MRI. Had MRI done this afternoon and he was administered 1000mg of steroid today starting 17 day treatment, spinal tap to be scheduled. Before we left the specialist he said that he did see white matter lesions in his orbital MRI so his diagnosis will likely be optic neuritis associated with MS. He did not definitively say that this would be the outcome, but feels confident that this is the most likely outcome. Obviously I'm reeling a little bit after today and am unsure what I can do for him right now. I'm thinking we can at least start seeing a marriage counselor as this will be a big undertaking for both of us. It's hard to not be able to fix it for him and I just feel kind of useless. I've gone to his appointments and took notes and asked questions for both him and myself. I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to best support him during this time of uncertainty and being in a short holding pattern. I don't want to scare him, but I don't want to sugar coat it either. Sorry I'm ranty and probably all over the place. It's been a strange day/week/month.

So far, it's been in remission, and reacting positively to meds, and all that good stuff. The only real issues I have are my legs hurt, I can't work longer than a 6 hour shift (I mean, I can do 8, but I won't be able to do anything the following day), and occasional cold patches where I was numb for a month or so. I'd like to get on medicaid, and maybe ssdi, but I keep getting rejected (because I can work, just not as much as I need to to be able to afford things). I found a lawyer who works on contingency who might be able to help. I just don't know if it's worth fighting to get.

I am just now at the point of talking about medications since it took over a month to get an appointment with my local MS specialist. I'm trying to gather as much information as I can to make the best decision for me. Has anyone out there decided to not be on medication? If so could you tell me why and how you came to the decision? Alternatively, if anyone out there has already put a lot of research into this, why did you decide medication was the better option for you? There are just so many side effects to medication and obviously a bad flare up is not good either... please help! Thanks :) Edit: Thank you all for your input. I read every single comment! I have decided to go on Tecfidera. I feel it has lower side effects than others and a good potential to reduce flare ups. Man, this disease is just the worst.

A little background, I was diagnosed (exactly) 6 years ago when I was 22. I started on 20mg Copaxone at the beginning of 2013 and switched to the 40mg version around 2015 since they offered a copay assistance program and a shot 3 days a week vs 7 sounded great. Over the years I've had one relapse, at the beginning of treatment, but other than that I've been doing well clinically. I get regular MRI testing done and I've gotten 4 or 5 lesions since my initial diagnosis, some enhancing some not. The most recent is from the past year, which did enhance. Anyway, my Neurologist recommended changing medications since lesions are still popping up. He suggested I look into these two oral options, Tecfidera and Aubagio. I'm leaning towards Tecfidera based on the side effects. It also seems that occasional alcohol wouldn't cause any issues. I'm in my 20s and enjoy to go out drinking with some friends every once in a while, and try to live a normal life when I'm not feeling drained or overly anxious (thanks Copaxone). Just seeing if there's anybody that's been in my shoes or has feedback on these two medications.

Should I have breakfast the morning the day of the infusion? Should I drink a lot of water the morning of, or just drinking a lot at the center will be enough?   I heard benadryl & steroids are optional, since this is my first time I'll take both.   I read about people really loving the drug, and others doing worse symptom-wise on Ocrevus, I am afraid because I don't know which I'll be. Any commonalities in the population of people who have done worse on it?   How can I chill the \* out? I would take it now if I could, the waiting is giving me too much time to be scared.

Looking into effects of the different DMDs on men trying to have children (i.e. on sperm)	"Hi   tl;dr: 30M wondering if only Aubagio is bad for men trying to have children with their partner.   I'm a early 30s male. I've recently been diagnosed with MS, likely RRMS since I've had one attack that I've noticed which consisted of numbness and some trouble walking, where the numbness symptoms have subsided to essentially nothing after 2 months.   I was initially diagnosed late october, with my first numbness symptoms early in october, and will likely be discussing treatment options in about a week from now.   I'll likely be starting on a first-line treatment (as defined in Norway), where the common options are one of the interferon beta shots like Extavia, or Copaxone, Aubagio or Tecfidera.   I've been trying to find out what effects the various medicines may have on pregnancy, as me and my partner are hoping to have children soon. The only real info I've found is that Aubagio is known to be found in sperm, so it's considered dodgy? From [drugs.com](https://drugs.com): >\-Use of adequate methods of contraception by both females and males is recommended during and for 2 years after stopping treatment. > >Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity, embryolethality and teratogenicity. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy. > >This drug has been detected in human semen. Men wanting to father a child should discontinue use and perform an accelerated elimination procedure to decrease the plasma concentration of teriflunomide to less than 0.02 mg/L.   Personally I really hate needles, and from what I'm reading the injectable interferon beta medicines are probably less effective, both in stopping loss of brain volume and in reducing attack frequency.   It is unlikely that I'll be starting on any (as defined in Norway) second-line treatment right away (like Lemtrada, Gilenya, Tysabri) or ""experimental"" treatments like HSCT or rituximab.   So if I get to avoid frequent injections, and Aubagio is out because of the known traces in sperm, then that would leave Tecfidera. Now I don't know if I'll be able to choose that since it's a more expensive drug, but hopefully my doctor will at least lend some weight to my wishes as well.   Does anyone know more about this issue? Is it only Aubagio that is considered unsafe for men trying to have children, or are there other issues with some of the other drugs? I've found it difficult to find definite information about it since usually only the potential effects on pregnant women is mentioned.   Will also happily hear general opinions on my treatment options! I'd really like to be as informed as possible before my next neurologist appointment.   Sorry for the long first post!

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4675178257505528601/MS-treatment-in-EU-or-possible-elsewhere	MS treatment in EU (or possible elsewhere)	Hello everyone on this subreddit. My wife was diagnosed 1.5 year ago, we are a 30 years old couple living in Kiev, Ukraine. And she has a second relapse during a year. First one was numbness and optical neuritis, and now huge vertigo, tunnel vision, eyes moving sideways if she relax them and adding to that this 'soldier-walking' symptome, don't know how to call it. We are pretty desperate here, because the only options available in our country for treatment are: solumedrol, prednizalone, immunoglobulins. And we tried almost everything last time, a month ago - 2 weeks of treatment in the local MS center. And a month passed, she got all those symptoms like it didn't even help with inflammation. Something like Ocrevus are simply not available here, the price is very high without any compensation from government. So basically the yearly price is equal to the price of 1 bedroom apartment to buy. Since I'm working in IT, we have quite good chances to move somewhere else, to get working permit at least for me in EU. And that's why I created this post here, can someone consult us how is treatment in their countries, especially interested in EU. Do medical insurances cover something like Ocrevus? We would be very grateful for any information regarding that. 	1	1	MS|treatment|in|EU|(|or|possible|elsewhere|)	Hello|everyone|on|this|subreddit|.|My|wife|was|diagnosed|1.5|year|ago|,|we|are|a|30|years|old|couple|living|in|Kiev|,|Ukraine|.|And|she|has|a|second|relapse|during|a|year|.|First|one|was|numbness|and|optical|neuritis|,|and|now|huge|vertigo|,|tunnel|vision|,|eyes|moving|sideways|if|she|relax|them|and|adding|to|that|this|'|soldier-walking|'|symptome|,|don't|know|how|to|call|it|.|We|are|pretty|desperate|here|,|because|the|only|options|available|in|our|country|for|treatment|are|:|solumedrol|,|prednizalone|,|immunoglobulins|.|And|we|tried|almost|everything|last|time|,|a|month|ago|-|2|weeks|of|treatment|in|the|local|MS|center|.|And|a|month|passed|,|she|got|all|those|symptoms|like|it|didn't|even|help|with|inflammation|.|Something|like|Ocrevus|are|simply|not|available|here|,|the|price|is|very|high|without|any|compensation|from|government|.|So|basically|the|yearly|price|is|equal|to|the|price|of|1|bedroom|apartment|to|buy|.|Since|I'm|working|in|IT|,|we|have|quite|good|chances|to|move|somewhere|else|,|to|get|working|permit|at|least|for|me|in|EU|.|And|that's|why|I|created|this|post|here|,|can|someone|consult|us|how|is|treatment|in|their|countries|,|especially|interested|in|EU|.|Do|medical|insurances|cover|something|like|Ocrevus|?|We|would|be|very|grateful|for|any|information|regarding|that|.

medmon.semanticlab.net/doc/4674942354491662068/Im-just-glad-they-saw-something.	I’m just glad they saw something.	Radiologist saw a blurry anomaly in the T5 region in my full spinal and subsequent scans after my car crash last year. He thought it was due to movement during my two hour MRI. Almost a year later, and a clear thoracic scan later, the anomaly was seen again. “Unenhancing T2 hypersensitivity at the level of T5-T6 which is stable.” My neurologist started asking all of these questions: - Have you experienced loss of movement, weakness, abnormal sensations in the lower half of your body? One or both of your legs? - Trouble with bowel movements or bladder function? - Vision problems - blurry idiom on one or both eyes? Loss of color? Eye pain? My answer? “Yes, and then some.” I've always stumbled and had my right leg go out on me at random times since I was in elementary. I had my first vertigo spell back in 2003-2004, then the episodic migraines beginning in 2007. Had a remission from 2009-2013. My right leg went numb and gave out when I was in the middle of a long run back in 2013. Then in 2015, my migraines became chronic. I changed my diet in November 2016, and managed to have one or two migraines a month... that is until September 2017. Three months after I got rear ended, my migraines have gotten to a point where I have one almost on a daily basis. In September 2017, my migraine also changed from NO AURA to sensory aura. The tingling travels up my right hand, up my arm, then stays in my face for a majority of the time. The pain has also changed from the back of my head to the front and in my temples and MY EARS. Oh my ears are the worst. The stabbing is intense. It also doesn't take much to trigger a migraine now. Side to side movement combined with noise from different sources will make me shut down, tingle, and make me want to take a spoon or shovel to pluck out the stabbing sensation in my temples and my ears. My eyesight gets blurry for no reason. I'm not even starting at anything. I thought it was just a part of getting older! But it's not the pain, the tingling, or the blurry vision that's the worst part. It's the confusion and slow speech and the memory problems. There's nothing I can take to combat those. I don't understand what anyone says. I can't communicate what I need to say. I can't find the words or SPELL. And I can't remember if I brushed my teeth minutes beforehand. My neurologist is prescribing further workup with MS specialists and a neurological ophthalmologist. But WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? What are they going to do to me? Help! 	1	0	I|’|m|just|glad|they|saw|something|.

My mom is going to need her infusion in July 2019 and they are telling her she will need to go all the way to Portland. She lives closer to the Ellsworth/Bangor area, are there any infusion centers around there that we might not be aware of? I know this is really far out but as everyone knows, this kind of stuff takes an immense amount of planning. I appreciate any helpful hints and thank you very much!!! 	1	1	Anyone|in|Maine|with|MS|on|Ocrevus|?

Colds, stomach viruses, etc, what normally puts people in bed for a day or two seems to effect me ten times worse. I know Ms affects the immune system so I know it's common, what I want to know is it okay to be rude to people who are sick? I take every precaution I can so I don't get so much as a cold. I made everyone in my house get the flu shot. When my eight year old gets home from school she goes straight into the shower and changes clothes. We lysol the bathroom and other shared spaces. But I'm still getting viruses, how do I tell people that if they so much as sneeze I don't want them around? 	1	1	Is|it|okay|to|be|rude|?
